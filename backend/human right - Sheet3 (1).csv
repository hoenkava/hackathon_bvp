APPELLANT,TEXT,JUDGMENT
Pune Municipal Corporation & Anr.,"Delay condoned in S.L.P. (C) Nos.15847-15855 of 2010. Leave granted.

2. In these 18 appeals, by special leave, it is argued on behalf of the respondents-landowners that in view of Section 24(2) of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short, ‘2013 Act’) which has come into effect on 01.01.2014, the subject land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, ‘1894 Act’) have lapsed. The question for decision relates to true meaning of the expression: “compensation has not been paid” occurring in Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.

3. It may not be necessary at all to go into the legality and correctness of the impugned judgment, if the subject land acquisition proceedings are held to have lapsed. We, therefore, deal with this aspect first.

4. The brief facts necessary for consideration of the above question are these. On 06.08.2002, the proposal of the Municipal Commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (for short, “Corporation”) duly approved by the Standing Committee for acquisition of lands admeasuring 43.94 acres for development of “Forest Garden” was sent to the Collector, Pune. The Collector sanctioned the proposal and on 20.02.2003 forwarded the same to Special Land Acquisition Officer (15), Pune for further action. On 30.09.2004, the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act was published in the official gazette. Then notices under Section 4(1) were served upon the landowners/interested persons. On 26.12.2005, the declaration under Section 6 was published in the official gazette and on 02.02.2006, it was also published at the site and on the notice board of the Office of Talaltti. Following the notices under Section 9, on 31.01.2008 the Special Land Acquisition Officer made the award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act.

5. The landowners challenged the above acquisition proceedings before the Bombay High Court in 9 writ petitions. Of them, 2 were filed before making award and 7 after the award. The challenge to the acquisition proceedings and the validity of the award was laid on diverse grounds including (i) absence of resolution of the General Body of the Corporation; (ii) non-compliance with the provisions of Section 5A, (iii) non-compliance with the provisions of Section 7, and (iv) lapsing of acquisition proceedings under Section 11A. The High Court on consideration of the arguments advanced before it by the parties has held that the acquisition proceedings for the development of “Forest Garden” could not be initiated by the Commissioner with the mere approval of the Standing Committee without resolution of the General Body of the Corporation. The acquisition proceedings were also held bad in law for non-compliance of Section 7 and other statutory breaches. Inter alia, the High Court has quashed the acquisition proceedings and gave certain directions including restoration of possession.

6. It is argued on behalf of the landowners that by virtue of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act, the subject acquisition shall be deemed to have been lapsed because the award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act is made more than five years prior to the commencement of 2013 Act and no compensation has been paid to the owners nor the amount of compensation has been deposited in the court by the Special Land Acquisition Officer.

7. On the other hand, on behalf of the Corporation and so also for the Collector, it is argued that the award was made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on 31.01.2008 strictly in terms of 1894 Act and on the very day the landowners were informed regarding the quantum of compensation for their respective lands. Notices were also issued to the landowners to reach the office of the Special Land Acquisition Officer and receive the amount of compensation and since they neither received the compensation nor any request came from them to make reference to the District Court under Section 18, the compensation amounting to Rs.27 crores was deposited in the government treasury. It is, thus, submitted that there was no default on the part of the Special Land Acquisition Officer or the government and, hence, the acquisition proceedings have not lapsed. Moreover, reliance is also placed on Section 114 of the 2013 Act and it is argued that the concluded land acquisition proceedings are not at all affected by Section 24(2) and the only right that survives to the landowners is to receive compensation.

8. 2013 Act puts in place entirely new regime for compulsory acquisition of land and provides for new scheme for compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement to the affected families whose land has been acquired or proposed to be acquired or affected by such acquisition.

9. To turn, now, to the meaning of the expression “compensation has not been paid” in Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act and its effect on the subject acquisition, it is necessary to refer to Section 24 which reads as follows:

“24. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, in any case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, -
a) Where no award under section 11 of the said Land Acquisition Act has been made, then, all provisions of this Act relating to the determination of compensation shall apply; or
b) Where an award under said section 11 has been made, then such proceedings shall continue under the provisions of the said Land Acquisition Act, as if the said Act has not been repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in case of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, where an award under the said section 11 has been made five years or more prior to the commencement of this Act but the physical possession of the land has not been taken or the compensation has not been paid the said proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed and the appropriate Government, if it so chooses, shall initiate the proceedings of such land acquisition afresh in accordance with the provisions of this Act:
Provided that where an award has been made and compensation in respect of a majority of land holding has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries, then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition under section 4 of the said Land Acquisition Act, shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.”
10. Insofar as sub-section (1) of Section 24 is concerned, it begins with non obstante clause. By this, Parliament has given overriding effect to this provision over all other provisions of 2013 Act. It is provided in clause (a) that where the land acquisition proceedings have been initiated under the 1894 Act but no award under Section 11 is made, then the provisions of 2013 Act shall apply relating to the determination of compensation. Clause (b) of Section 24(1) makes provision that where land acquisition proceedings have been initiated under the 1894 Act and award has been made under Section 11, then such proceedings shall continue under the provisions of the 1894 Act as if that Act has not been repealed.

11. Section 24(2) also begins with non obstante clause. This provision has overriding effect over Section 24(1). Section 24(2) enacts that in relation to the land acquisition proceedings initiated under 1894 Act, where an award has been made five years or more prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act and either of the two contingencies is satisfied, viz; (i) physical possession of the land has not been taken or

(ii) the compensation has not been paid, such acquisition proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed. On the lapse of such acquisition proceedings, if the appropriate government still chooses to acquire the land which was the subject matter of acquisition under the 1894 Act then it has to initiate the proceedings afresh under the 2013 Act. The proviso appended to Section 24(2) deals with a situation where in respect of the acquisition initiated under the 1894 Act an award has been made and compensation in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries then all the beneficiaries specified in Section 4 notification become entitled to compensation under 2013 Act.

12. To find out the meaning of the expression, “compensation has not been paid”, it is necessary to have a look at Section 31 of the 1894 Act. The said Section, to the extent it is relevant, reads as follows:

“31. Payment of compensation or deposit of same in Court. – (1) On making an award under section 11, the Collector shall tender payment of the compensation awarded by him to the persons interested entitled thereto according to the award, and shall pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in the next sub-section.
(2) If they shall not consent to receive it, or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the compensation or as to the apportionment of it, the Collector shall deposit the amount of the compensation in the Court to which a reference under section 18 would be submitted:
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx”
13. There is amendment in Maharashtra—Nagpur (City) in Section 31 whereby in sub-section (1), after the words “compensation” and in sub-
section (2), after the words, “the amount of compensation”, the words “and costs if any” have been inserted.

14. Section 31(1) of the 1894 Act enjoins upon the Collector, on making an award under Section 11, to tender payment of compensation to persons interested entitled thereto according to award. It further mandates the Collector to make payment of compensation to them unless prevented by one of the contingencies contemplated in sub-section (2). The contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2) are: (i) the persons interested entitled to compensation do not consent to receive it (ii) there is no person competent to alienate the land and (iii) there is dispute as to the title to receive compensation or as to the apportionment of it. If due to any of the contingencies contemplated in Section 31(2), the Collector is prevented from making payment of compensation to the persons interested who are entitled to compensation, then the Collector is required to deposit the compensation in the court to which reference under Section 18 may be made.

15. Simply put, Section 31 of the 1894 Act makes provision for payment of compensation or deposit of the same in the court. This provision requires that the Collector should tender payment of compensation as awarded by him to the persons interested who are entitled to compensation. If due to happening of any contingency as contemplated in Section 31(2), the compensation has not been paid, the Collector should deposit the amount of compensation in the court to which reference can be made under Section 18.

16. The mandatory nature of the provision in Section 31(2) with regard to deposit of the compensation in the court is further fortified by the provisions contained in Sections 32, 33 and 34. As a matter of fact, Section 33 gives power to the court, on an application by a person interested or claiming an interest in such money, to pass an order to invest the amount so deposited in such government or other approved securities and may direct the interest or other proceeds of any such investment to be accumulated and paid in such manner as it may consider proper so that the parties interested therein may have the benefit therefrom as they might have had from the land in respect whereof such money shall have been deposited or as near thereto as may be.

17. While enacting Section 24(2), Parliament definitely had in its view Section 31 of the 1894 Act. From that one thing is clear that it did not intend to equate the word “paid” to “offered” or “tendered”. But at the same time, we do not think that by use of the word “paid”, Parliament intended receipt of compensation by the landowners/persons interested. In our view, it is not appropriate to give a literal construction to the expression “paid” used in this sub-section (sub-section (2) of Section 24). If a literal construction were to be given, then it would amount to ignoring procedure, mode and manner of deposit provided in Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act in the event of happening of any of the contingencies contemplated therein which may prevent the Collector from making actual payment of compensation. We are of the view, therefore, that for the purposes of Section 24(2), the compensation shall be regarded as “paid” if the compensation has been offered to the person interested and such compensation has been deposited in the court where reference under Section 18 can be made on happening of any of the contingencies contemplated under Section 31(2) of the 1894 Act. In other words, the compensation may be said to have been “paid” within the meaning of Section 24(2) when the Collector (or for that matter Land Acquisition Officer) has discharged his obligation and deposited the amount of compensation in court and made that amount available to the interested person to be dealt with as provided in Sections 32 and 33.

18. 1894 Act being an expropriatory legislation has to be strictly followed. The procedure, mode and manner for payment of compensation are prescribed in Part V (Sections 31-34) of the 1894 Act. The Collector, with regard to the payment of compensation, can only act in the manner so provided. It is settled proposition of law (classic statement of Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad[1]) that where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all. Other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden.

19. Now, this is admitted position that award was made on 31.01.2008. Notices were issued to the landowners to receive the compensation and since they did not receive the compensation, the amount (Rs.27 crores) was deposited in the government treasury. Can it be said that deposit of the amount of compensation in the government treasury is equivalent to the amount of compensation paid to the landowners/persons interested? We do not think so. In a comparatively recent decision, this Court in Agnelo Santimano Fernandes[2], relying upon the earlier decision in Prem Nath Kapur[3], has held that the deposit of the amount of the compensation in the state’s revenue account is of no avail and the liability of the state to pay interest subsists till the amount has not been deposited in court.

20. From the above, it is clear that the award pertaining to the subject land has been made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer more than five years prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act. It is also admitted position that compensation so awarded has neither been paid to the landowners/persons interested nor deposited in the court. The deposit of compensation amount in the government treasury is of no avail and cannot be held to be equivalent to compensation paid to the landowners/persons interested. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the subject land acquisition proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act.

21. The argument on behalf of the Corporation that the subject land acquisition proceedings have been concluded in all respects under the 1894 Act and that they are not affected at all in view of Section 114(2) of the 2013 Act, has no merit at all, and is noted to be rejected. Section 114(1) of the 2013 Act repeals 1894 Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 114, however, makes Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applicable with regard to the effect of repeal but this is subject to the provisions in the 2013 Act. Under Section 24(2) land acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act, by legal fiction, are deemed to have lapsed where award has been made five years or more prior to the commencement of 2013 Act and possession of the land is not taken or compensation has not been paid. The legal fiction under Section 24(2) comes into operation as soon as conditions stated therein are satisfied. The applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act being subject to Section 24(2), there is no merit in the contention of the Corporation.

22. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is not necessary to consider the correctness of the impugned judgment on merits.",0
SYED SADIQ ETC.,"This appeal is filed by the appellants questioning the correctness of the common judgment and final order dated 31.10.2011 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in M.F.A. No. 1131 of 2011 [MV], C/W M.F.A. Nos. 1132 and 1133 of 2011 [MV], urging various facts and legal contentions in justification of their claim.

3. Necessary relevant facts are stated hereunder to appreciate the case of the appellants and also to find out whether the appellants are entitled for the relief as prayed in these appeals.

On 14.8.2008, all the three appellants/ claimants in the appeals herein were proceeding on the left side of the road by pushing the motorcycle bearing Registration no. KA-16-2404 since it was punctured. When the appellants/ claimants came near the Coper Petrol Bunk, opposite to Jai Hind Hotel, a tractor bearing no KA-16/T-8219-8220 came from the opposite direction on its right side in rash and negligent manner and dashed into the motor cycle and the appellants/claimants. This resulted in all the appellants/claimants sustaining grievous injuries.

4. They filed MV Case Nos. 149, 147 and 148 of 2010 respectively before the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chitradurga (for short ‘the Tribunal’). The Tribunal awarded different awards in the three different appeals which had been heard together by the High Court of Karnataka. Since the injuries suffered by the three appellants are different, we are inclined to decide upon the appeals individually. As far as injuries sustained by the appellants in the road accident are concerned, there is no dispute that the accident occurred on 14.02.2008 due to the rash and negligent driving of the tractor- trailer bearing registration No. KA-16/T-8219-8220 by its driver. The appeals therefore, are confined to determining whether the quantum of compensation which was enhanced by the High Court from that of the Tribunal is just and proper or whether it requires further enhancement in the interest of justice. We take up the appeals one at a time.

Civil Appeal @ MFA 1131/2011 (MVC No. 149/ 2010)

5. It is evident from the material and legal evidence produced on record that the appellant/ claimant in this appeal had sustained injuries to lower end of right femur and his right leg was amputated. Further, he had sustained injury over his left upper arm. The injuries sustained by him and the treatment taken by him are evident from the wound certificate Ex. P-6, discharge cards Ex.P-7&8, disability certificate Ex. P-12, X-ray films Ex.P-218 and was further supported by oral evidence of the appellant/claimant and the doctor examined as PW-1 and PW-4 respectively. PW-4 Dr. Rajesh had stated in his evidence that the appellant/claimant had suffered disability of 24% to upper limb and 85% to lower limb. The Tribunal, however, had considered the disability of the appellant/claimant caused to whole body at 30%. The High Court however, taking into consideration the amputation of the right leg of the appellant/claimant, determined the disability at 65% without assigning any proper reason for coming to this conclusion. Therefore, we intend to assign our reasons to hold that the High Court has erred in concluding the disability at 65%.

6. This Court in the case of Mohan Soni v. Ram Avtar Tomar & Ors.[1], has elaborately discussed upon the factors which determine the loss of income of the claimant more objectively. The relevant paragraph reads as under:

“11. In a more recent decision in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and another, (2011) 1 SCC 343, this Court considered in great detail the correlation between the physical disability suffered in an accident and the loss of earning capacity resulting from it. In paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 of the judgment in Raj Kumar, this Court made the following observations:
10. Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of injuries, the assessment of compensation under the head of loss of future earnings would depend upon the effect and impact of such permanent disability on his earning capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically apply the percentage of permanent disability as the percentage of economic loss or loss of earning capacity. In most of the cases, the percentage of economic loss, that is, the percentage of loss of earning capacity, arising from a permanent disability will be different from the percentage of permanent disability. Some Tribunals wrongly assume that in all cases, a particular extent (percentage) of permanent disability would result in a corresponding loss of earning capacity, and consequently, if the evidence produced show 45% as the permanent disability, will hold that there is 45% loss of future earning capacity. In most of the cases, equating the extent (percentage) of loss of earning capacity to the extent (percentage) of permanent disability will result in award of either too low or too high a compensation.
11. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of the permanent disability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning capacity in terms of a percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying the standard multiplier method used to determine loss of dependency). We may however note that in some cases, on appreciation of evidence and assessment, the Tribunal may find that the percentage of loss of earning capacity as a result of the permanent disability is approximately the same as the percentage of permanent disability in which case, of course, the Tribunal will adopt the said percentage for determination of compensation. (See for example, the decisions of this Court in Arvind Kumar Mishra v. New India Assurance Company Ltd.  (2010) 10 SCC 254 and Yadava Kumar v. National Insurance Company Ltd. (2010) 10 SCC 341).
13. Ascertainment of the effect of the permanent disability on the actual earning capacity involves three steps. The Tribunal has to first ascertain what activities the claimant could carry on in spite of the permanent disability and what he could not do as a result of the permanent disability (this is also relevant for awarding compensation under the head of loss of amenities of life). The second step is to ascertain his avocation, profession and nature of work before the accident, as also his age. The third step is to find out whether (i) the claimant is totally disabled from earning any kind of livelihood, or (ii) whether in spite of the permanent disability, the claimant could still effectively carry on the activities and functions, which he was earlier carrying on, or (iii) whether he was prevented or restricted from discharging his previous activities and functions, but could carry on some other or lesser scale of activities and functions so that he continues to earn or can continue to earn his livelihood.”
7. Further, the appellant claims that he was working as a vegetable vendor. It is true that a vegetable vendor might not require mobility to the extent that he sells vegetables at one place. However, the occupation of vegetable vending is not confined to selling vegetables from a particular location. It rather involves procuring vegetables from the whole-sale market or the farmers and then selling it off in the retail market. This often involves selling vegetables in the cart which requires 100% mobility. But even by conservative approach, if we presume that the vegetable vending by the appellant/claimant involved selling vegetables from one place, the claimant would require assistance with his mobility in bringing vegetables to the market place which otherwise would be extremely difficult for him with an amputated leg. We are required to be sensitive while dealing with manual labour cases where loss of limb is often equivalent to loss of livelihood. Yet, considering that the appellant/claimant is still capable to fend for his livelihood once he is brought in the market place, we determine the disability at 85% to determine the loss of income.

8. The appellant/claimant in his appeal further claimed that he had been earning [pic]10,000/- p.m. by doing vegetable vending work. The High Court however, considered the loss of income at [pic]3500/- p.m. considering that the claimant did not produce any document to establish his loss of income. It is difficult for us to convince ourselves as to how a labour involved in an unorganized sector doing his own business is expected to produce documents to prove his monthly income. In this regard, this Court, in the case of Ramchandrappa v. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Company Limited[2], has held as under:

“13. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the Appellant was aged about 35 years and was working as a Coolie and was earning [pic]4500/- per month at the time of accident. This claim is reduced by the Tribunal to a sum of [pic]3000/- only on the assumption that wages of the labourer during the relevant period viz. in the year 2004, was [pic]100/- per day. This assumption in our view has no basis. Before the Tribunal, though Insurance Company was served, it did not choose to appear before the Court nor did it repudiated the claim of the claimant. Therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal to have reduced the claim of the claimant and determined the monthly earning a sum of [pic]3000/- p.m. Secondly, the Appellant was working as a Coolie and therefore, we cannot expect him to produce any documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. In the absence of any other evidence contrary to the claim made by the claimant, in our view, in the facts of the present case, the Tribunal should have accepted the claim of the claimant.
14. We hasten to add that in all cases and in all circumstances, the Tribunal need not accept the claim of the claimant in the absence of supporting material. It depends on the facts of each case. In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. In the present case, Appellant was working as a Coolie and in and around the date of the accident, the wage of the labourer was between [pic]100/- to [pic]150/- per day or [pic]4500/- per month. In our view, the claim was honest and bonafide and, therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal to have reduced the monthly earning of the Appellant from [pic]4500/- to [pic]3000/- per month. We, therefore, accept his statement that his monthly earning was [pic]4500/-.”
9. There is no reason, in the instant case for the Tribunal and the High Court to ask for evidence of monthly income of the appellant/claimant. On the other hand, going by the present state of economy and the rising prices in agricultural products, we are inclined to believe that a vegetable vendor is reasonably capable of earning [pic]6,500/- per month.

10. Further, it is evident from the material evidence on record that the appellant/claimant was 24 years old at the time of occurrence of the accident. It is also established on record that he was earning his livelihood by vending vegetables. The issue regarding calculation of prospective increment of income in the future of self employed people, came up in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Limited[3], wherein this Court has held as under:

“14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the observation made in paragraph 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma's case that where the deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will usually take only the actual income at the time of death and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be nave to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would remain the same throughout his life.
15. The rise in the cost of living affects everyone across the board. It does not make any distinction between rich and poor. As a matter of fact, the effect of rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of living is minimal on the rich and maximum on those who are self-employed or who get fixed income/emoluments. They are the worst affected people. Therefore, they put extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for sustaining their families.
16. The salaries of those employed under the Central and State Governments and their agencies/instrumentalities have been revised from time to time to provide a cushion against the rising prices and provisions have been made for providing security to the families of the deceased employees. The salaries of those employed in private sectors have also increased manifold. Till about two decades ago, nobody could have imagined that salary of Class IV employee of the Government would be in five figures and total emoluments of those in higher echelons of service will cross the figure of rupees one lac.
17. Although, the wages/income of those employed in unorganized sectors has not registered a corresponding increase and has not kept pace with the increase in the salaries of the Government employees and those employed in private sectors but it cannot be denied that there has been incremental enhancement in the income of those who are self-employed and even those engaged on daily basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis. We can take judicial notice of the fact that with a view to meet the challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons falling in the latter category periodically increase the cost of their labour. In this context, it may be useful to give an example of a tailor who earns his livelihood by stitching cloths. If the cost of living increases and the prices of essentials go up, it is but natural for him to increase the cost of his labour. So will be the cases of ordinary skilled and unskilled labour, like, barber, blacksmith, cobbler, mason etc.
18. Therefore, we do not think that while making the observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of Sarla Verma's judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an absolute rule that there will be no addition in the income of a person who is self-employed or who is paid fixed wages. Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a person who is self-
employed or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30 per cent increase in his total income over a period of time and if he / she becomes victim of accident then the same formula deserves to be applied for calculating the amount of compensation.” Therefore, considering that the appellant/ claimant was self employed and was 24 years of age, we hold that he is entitled to 50% increment in the future prospect of income based upon the principle laid down in the Santosh Devi case (supra).

11. Further, regarding the use of multiplier, it was held in the Sarla Verma v. DTC[4] which was upheld in Santosh Devi case (supra), as under:

“42. We therefore hold that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the table above (prepared by applying Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie), which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 (for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years), reduced by one unit for every five years, that is M-17 for 26 to 30 years, M-16 for 31 to 35 years, M-15 for 36 to 40 years, M-14 for 41 to 45 years, and M-
13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every five years, that is, M-11 for 51 to 55 years, M-9 for 56 to 60 years, M-7 for 61 to 65 years and M-5 for 66 to 70 years.” Therefore, applying the principle of Sarla Verma in the present case, we hold that the High Court was correct in applying the multiplier of 18 and we uphold the same for the purpose for calculating the amount of compensation to which the appellant/ claimant is entitled to.

12. With respect to the medical expenses incurred by the appellant/claimant, he has produced medical bills and incidental charges bills marked as Exs. P-25 to P-201 and prescriptions at Exs. P-202 to P-217 on the basis of which the Tribunal awarded a compensation of [pic]60,000/- under the head. However, considering that the appellant might have to change his artificial leg from time to time, we shall allot an amount of [pic]1,00,000/- under the head of medical cost and incidental expenses to include future medical costs.

Thus, the total amount which is awarded under the head of ‘loss of future income’ including the 50% increment in the future, works out to be [pic] 17,90,100/- [([pic]65,00/- x 85/100 + 50/100 x 85/100 x [pic]6,500/-) x 12 x 18].

13. Further, along with compensation under conventional heads, the appellant/claimant is also entitled to the cost of litigation as per the legal principle laid down by this Court in the case of Balram Prasad v. Kunal Saha[5]. Therefore, under this head, we find it just and proper to allow [pic]25,000/-

14. Hence, the appellant/claimant is entitled to the compensation under the following heads:

|Towards cost of artificial leg     |[pic]50,000/-                |
|Towards pain and suffering         |[pic]75,000/-                |
|Towards loss of marriage prospectus|[pic]50,000/-                |
|Towards loss of amenities          |[pic]75,000/-                |
|Towards medical and incidental cost|[pic]1,00,000/-              |
|Towards cost of litigation         |[pic]25,000/-                |




15. Also, by relying upon the principle laid down by this Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy[6], we find it just and proper to allow interest at the rate of 9% per annum.

16. Hence, the total amount of claim the appellant/claimant becomes entitled to is [pic]21,65,100/- with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of application till the date of payment.

Civil Appeal @ MFA 1132/2011 (MVC No. 147/2010)

17. The appellant/claimant in this appeal has sustained type -3 compound fracture of right femur, fracture of tibia, fracture of middle shaft tibia and fibula. The injuries sustained and the treatment taken by the appellant/claimant are evident from discharge card Ex. P-225, photographs marked as Ex. P-227 to P-234, disability certificate marked as Ex. P-236, X-ray films Ex. P-574 supported by the oral evidence of the claimant and the doctor examined as PW-3 and PW-4 respectively. PW-4 Dr. Rajesh had stated in his evidence that the appellant/ claimant has suffered from permanent disability of 69% to lower limb. The High Court has taken his functional disability at 25%. However, while determining the disability of the claimants in motor accidents cases, this Court might be sensitive about the functional disability involved and the nature of the occupation, particularly, if the occupation involves manual labour. Therefore, we hold that the High Court erred in determining the functional disability of the appellant in the present appeal on the lower side. Since, the appellant/claimant in the present appeal is also a vegetable vendor like the appellant/claimant in Civil Appeal @ MFA 1131/2011, we take his monthly income at [pic]6,500/- on average and for the reasons recorded in that appeal, we determine the functional disability of the appellant/claimant in the present appeal at 35%. Considering his age, and based on the legal principle laid down by this Court in the cases mentioned supra, we hold his increment on future income at 50% and the multiplier at 18. Therefore, he is entitled to [pic]7,37,100/- [([pic]6,500 x 35/100 + 50/100 x 35/100 x [pic]6,500) x 12 x18] under the head of ‘loss of future income’.

18. The amount awarded by the Tribunal and the High Court under other conventional heads have not been disputed by the appellant/claimant by producing contrary evidence. Therefore, the amount awarded under those heads shall remain constant. Based on the reasoning given by us in the earlier appeal, the appellant/claimant is also entitled to the cost of litigation at [pic]25,000/-.

19. Hence, the appellant/claimant is entitled to compensation under the following heads:

      |Towards pain and suffering     |[pic]60,000/-                       |
|Towards medical and incidental |[pic]1,00,000/-                     |
|charges                        |                                    |
|Towards loss of amenities      |[pic]40,000/-                       |
|Towards future medical expenses|[pic]15,000/-                       |
|Towards cost of litigation     |[pic]25,000/-                       |


20. Therefore, the appellant/ claimant is entitled to a total sum of [pic]9,77,100/- with interest @ 9% per annum based on the principle laid down by this Court mentioned supra.

Civil Appeal @ MFA 1133/2011 (MVC No. 148/2010)

21. The appellant/claimant in this appeal has identified himself as a cleaner of lorries by profession. As per the wound certificate Ex. P- 219, it has been established that the appellant/ claimant has sustained fracture on middle 1/3rd of right humerus and comminuted fracture at the junction of upper 1/3rd and middle 1/3rd of right tibia. The injuries sustained by him and the treatment taken by him is evident from the disability certificate marked as Ex. P-221, X-ray film marked as Ex. P-222 which is supported by oral evidence of the claimant and doctor examined as PW-2 and PW-4 respectively. PW-4 Dr. Rajesh has stated in his evidence that the claimant has suffered 22% permanent disability to upper limb and 29% to lower limb. The High Court has calculated the functional disability to 13%. We are inclined to hold that the High Court has erred in ascertaining the functional disability to such a low percentage considering that the appellant/claimant earns his livelihood through manual labour. It is evident from the material evidence produced on record that the appellant/claimant has suffered from comminuted fracture in the accident as a result of which he will not be able to bend, stretch or rotate his right hand. He will also not be able to lift heavy material which is so essential to carry on with his business to earn his livelihood. Therefore, we are inclined to observe that the appellant/claimant suffers from a functional disability to the extent of 85%.

22. Further, the appellant/claimant has claimed that he has been earning [pic]5,000/- p.m. by working as a cleaner of the lorry. The Tribunal assessed his monthly income at [pic]3000/-. The High Court, considering his age and his profession as a cleaner, assessed his income at [pic]3500/-. However, based on the Karnataka State Minimum Wages Rule 2012-2013, the appellant/claimant is entitled to [pic]4246/- per month. Since, no written record of his income could be produced before the Court, we take his income, as per Revised Minimum Wages Rule at [pic]4246/- rounding it off as [pic]4300/- per month. Further, an amount of [pic]700/- can be added as daily barter charges. Therefore, his monthly income amounts to [pic]5000/-.

23. Further, considering that the appellant/ claimant was 22 years of age, the multiplier applicable to his age group is 18 and also based on the legal principle laid down by this Court in various cases, we hold that he is entitled to 50% increment in future loss of income. Therefore, he is entitled to an amount at [pic] 13,77,000/- [([pic]5000 x 85/100 + 50/100 x 85/100 x Rs.5,000) x 12 x 18].

24. It is pertinent to note that the appellant/ claimant in this appeal has produced medical bills for [pic]8000/-. He was treated as an inpatient for 15 days in a private hospital. Therefore, considering the same, the High Court has awarded a sum of [pic]15000/- under the head of medical and incidental expenses. However, considering the fact that the appellant/claimant was also required to have conveyance, nourishment and attendant charges for proper recovery of health, we increase the compensation under this head to [pic]50,000/-. Further, considering the fracture sustained by the appellant/claimant and the evidence produced by the doctor, another [pic]5000/- awarded by the High Court towards future expenses is upheld by us.

25. Further, towards loss of amenities, the Tribunal has awarded [pic]10,000/-. However, considering the disability stated by the doctor and the amount of discomfort and unhappiness he has to undergo in the future life, the High Court has awarded [pic]20,000/- under this head. We intend to observe that the amount awarded by the High Court under this head is very meager and inadequate considering the age and the amount of disability. Therefore, under this head, we award a sum of [pic]50,000/-.

26. Apart from this, based on the reasoning we have already provided above for the two other appellants/claimants, the appellant/claimant in this appeal, is also entitled to compensation under the following heads:

|Towards pain and suffering     |[pic]60,000/-           |
|Towards medical and incidental |[pic]50,000/-           |
|expenses                       |                        |
|Towards loss of amenities      |[pic]50,000/-           |
|Towards future expenses        |[pic]5,000/-            |
|Towards cost of litigation     |[pic]25,000/-           |


27. Therefore, the appellant/ claimant in this appeal is entitled to a total amount of [pic]15,67,000/- with an interest of 9% per annum from the date of application till the date of payment.

Contributory Negligence

28. On the matter of extent of contribution to the accident, it is held by the Tribunal that the appellants/claimants herein should have taken utmost care while moving on the highway. Looking at the spot of the accident, the Tribunal concluded that the appellants/claimants were moving on the middle of the road which led to the accident. Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that though the tractor has been charge sheeted under sections 279 and 338 of IPC, but given the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellants/claimants also contributed to the accident to the extent of 25%. The High Court without assigning any reason concurred with the findings of the Tribunal with respect to contributory negligence. We find it pertinent to observe that both the Tribunal and the High Court erred in holding the appellants/ claimants in these appeals liable for contributory negligence. The Tribunal arrived at the above conclusion only on the basis of the fact that the accident took place in the middle of the road in the absence of any evidence to prove the same. Therefore, we are inclined to hold that the contribution of the appellants/claimants in the accident is not proved by the respondents by producing evidence and therefore, the finding of the Tribunal regarding contributory negligence, which has been upheld by the High Court, is set aside.

29. The appeals are allowed accordingly. The appellant/claimant in Civil Appeal @ MFA 1131/2011 (MVC No. 149/ 2010) is awarded a compensation of amount at [pic]21,65,100/-. The appellant/claimant in Civil Appeal @ MFA 1132/2011 (MVC No. 147/2010) is awarded a compensation of amount at [pic]9,77,100/-. The appellant/claimant in Civil Appeal @ MFA 1133/2011 (MVC No. 148/2010) is awarded a compensation of amount at [pic]15,67,000/-. All the appellants/claimants are entitled to interest @ 9% per annum from the date of application till the date of payment.

30. The name of the erstwhile first respondent has been deleted from the array of parties by Order of this Court dated 1.7.2013. The Insurance Company remains the sole respondent in this case. Therefore, we direct the Insurance Company to deposit 50% of the awarded amount with proportionate interest within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, after deducting the amount if already paid, in any of the Nationalized Bank of the choice of the appellants for a period of 3 years. During the said period, if they want to withdraw a portion or entire deposited amount for their personal or any other expenses, including development of their asset, then they are at liberty to file application before the Tribunal for release of the deposited amount, which may be considered by it and pass appropriate order in this regard.",1
SUBHASH CHAND,"
2. This appeal, by special leave, is directed against judgment and order dated 07/01/2011 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Criminal Misc. Case No.427 of 2009 whereby the High Court dismissed the petition filed by the appellant holding that an appeal filed by the State against an order of acquittal shall lie to the Sessions Court under Section 378(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, “the Code”) and not under Section 378(4) of the Code to the High Court.

3. The appellant is the supplier-cum-manufacturer of the food article namely Sweetened Carbonated Water. He is carrying on business in the name and style of M/s. Subhash Soda Water Factory. On 6/6/1989 at about 4.15 p.m., one P.N. Khatri, Food Inspector, purchased a sample of sweetened carbonated water for analysis from one Daya Chand Jain, Vendor-cum- Contractor of Canteen at Suraj Cinema, Dhansa Road, Najafgarh, Delhi. After following the necessary procedure, the sample was sent to the Public Analyst for analysis. On analysis, the Public Analyst opined that the sample does not conform to the prescribed standard. After conclusion of the investigation, the respondent–State through its Local Health Authority

- P.K. Jaiswal filed a Complaint bearing No.64 of 1991 against the appellant and Daya Chand in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi alleging that the appellant and the said Daya Chand had violated the provisions of Sections 2(ia), (a), (b), (f), (h), (l), (m), Section 2(ix)

(j), (k) and Section 24 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (for short, “PFA Act”) and Rule 32, Rule 42 (zzz)(i) and Rule 47 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955 (for short, “the Rules”) and committed an offence punishable under Section 16(1)(1A) read with Section 7 of the PFA Act and the Rules. Since Daya Chand died during the pendency of the case, the case abated as against him. The appellant was tried and acquitted by learned Magistrate by order dated 27/2/2007.

4. Being aggrieved by the said order dated 27/2/2007, the respondent- State preferred Criminal Appeal No.13 of 2008 in the Sessions Court under Section 378(1)(a) of the Code. The appellant raised a preliminary objection in regard to the maintainability of the said Appeal before the Sessions Court in view of Section 378(4) of the Code. He contended that an appeal arising from an order of acquittal in a complaint case shall lie to the High Court. The said objection was rejected by the Sessions Court by order dated 4/2/2009.

5. Aggrieved by the said order dated 4/2/2009, the appellant preferred Criminal Misc. Case No.427 of 2009 before the High Court. By order dated 9/7/2009, the High Court held that the Sessions Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal filed in a complaint case and directed that the appeal be transferred to it. Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.13 of 2008 pending before the Sessions Court was transferred to the High Court and re- numbered as Criminal Appeal No.642 of 2009.

6. The respondent-State carried the said order dated 9/7/2009 to this court by Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.9880 of 2009 (Criminal Appeal No.1514 of 2010). By order dated 13/8/2010, this court remanded the matter to the High Court and directed that the matter be decided afresh after taking into consideration Sections 378(1) and 378(4) of the Code and the relevant provisions of the PFA. On remand, the High Court passed the impugned judgment and order dated 7/1/2011.

7. The short point which arises for consideration in this appeal is whether in a complaint case, an appeal from an order of acquittal of the Magistrate would lie to the Sessions Court under Section 378(1) (a) of the Code or to the High Court under Section 378(4) of the Code.

8. At our request, Mr. Sidharth Luthra, learned Additional Solicitor General has assisted us as Amicus Curiae. We have heard Ms. Meenakshi Lekhi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the State. Written submissions have been filed by the counsel which we have carefully perused. Mr. Luthra took us through the relevant excerpts of Law Commission’s reports. He took us through the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 1994 ( Bill No. XXXV of 1994). He also took us through un-amended and amended Section 378 of the Code. After analyzing the relevant provisions, Mr. Luthra submitted that no appeal lies against an order of acquittal in cases instituted upon a complaint to the Sessions Court. Ms. Lekhi also adopted similar line of reasoning.

9. Mr. Malhotra learned Additional Solicitor General adopted a different line of argument and therefore, it is necessary to note his submissions in detail. Counsel pointed out how the law relating to appeals against orders of acquittal has evolved over the years. Counsel submitted that under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1861 no appeal against an order of acquittal could be filed. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1872 permitted only the State Government to file an appeal against acquittal order. Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 permitted only the State to file an appeal against acquittal order. In 1955 it was amended so as to permit the complainant to file an appeal against acquittal order. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 417 was substituted by Section 378. Counsel pointed out that under Section 378(4) a complainant could prefer appeal against order of acquittal, if special leave was granted by the High Court. However, in all cases the State could present appeal against order of acquittal. Counsel then referred to Section 378 of the Code as amended by Act No. 25 of 2005 and submitted that the only change in sub-section (1) is adding clauses (a) and (b) to it. Counsel described this change as minor and submitted that the State’s right to file appeal against orders of acquittal remains intact and is not taken away. Counsel relied on the words ‘State Government may, in any case’ and submitted that these words preserve the State’s right to file appeal against acquittal orders of all types. There is no limitation on this right whatsoever. This right is preserved according to the counsel because the State is the protector of people. Safety and security of the community is its concern. Even if a complainant does not file an appeal against an order of acquittal, the State Government can in public interest file it. Counsel also addressed us on the question of plurality of appeals. That issue is not before us. It is, therefore, not necessary to refer to that submission. In support of his submissions counsel placed reliance on Khemraj v. State of Madhya Pradesh[1], State (Delhi Adminsitration) v. Dharampal[2], Akalu Ahir & Ors. v. Ramdeo Ram[3], State v. Ram Babu & Ors.[4], Food Inspector v. Moidoo[5], Prasannachary v. Chikkapinachari & Anr.[6], State of Maharashtra v. Limbaji Sayaji Mhaske, Sarpanch Gram Panchayat[7], State of Punjab & Anr. v. Jagan Nath[8] and State of Orissa v. Sapneswar Thappa[9].

10. To understand the controversy, it is necessary to have a look at Section 378 of the Code prior to its amendment by Act 25 of 2005 and Section 378 amended thereby.

11. Section 378 of the Code prior to its amendment by Act 25 of 2005 read as under:

“Appeal in case of acquittal.
378. Appeal in case of acquittal. (1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2) and subject to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (5), the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court 2*[or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision.] (2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946), or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code, the Central Government may also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), to the High Court from the order of acquittal.
(3) No appeal under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be entertained except with the leave of the High Court.
(4) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf, grants special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant may present such an appeal to the High Court.
(5) No application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal.
(6) If in any case, the application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub- section (1) or under sub-section (2).” Thus, under earlier Section 378(1) of the Code, the State Government could, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any court other than a High Court or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision. Section 378(2) covered cases where order of acquittal was passed in any case in which the offence had been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than the Code. In such cases, the Central Government could also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal. Section 378(3) stated that appeals under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 378 of the Code could not be entertained except with the leave of the High Court. Sub-section (4) of Section 378 of the Code provided for orders of acquittal passed in any case instituted upon complaint. According to this provision, if on an application made to it by the complainant, the High Court grants special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant could present such an appeal to the High Court. Sub-section (5) of Section 378 of the Code provided for a period of limitation. Sub-section (6) of Section 378 of the Code stated that if in any case, the application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub-sections (1) or (2). Thus, if the High Court refused to grant special leave to appeal to the complainant, no appeal from that order of acquittal could be filed by the State or the agency contemplated in Section 378(2). It is clear from these provisions that earlier an appeal against an order of acquittal could only lie to the High Court. Sub-section (4) was aimed at giving finality to the orders of acquittal.

12. Before we proceed to analyze the amended Section 378 of the Code, it is necessary to quote the relevant clause in the 154th Report of the Law Commission of India, which led to the amendment of Section 378 by Act 25 of 2005. It reads thus:

“6.12. Clause 37: In order to guard against the arbitrary exercise of power and to reduce reckless acquittals, Section 378 is sought to be amended providing an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of cognizable and non-bailable offence filed on a police report to the Court of Session as directed by the District Magistrate. In respect of all other cases filed on a police report, an appeal shall lie to the High Court against an order of acquittal passed by any other court other than the High Court, as directed by the State Government. The power to recommend appeal in the first category is sought to be vested in the District Magistrate and the power in respect of second category would continue with the State Government.” The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 1994 has the same note on Clause 37.
13. Though, the Law Commission’s 154th report indicated that Section 378 was being amended to provide that an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence filed on a police report would lie to the court of Sessions, the words “police report” were not included in the amended Section 378. In this connection, it is necessary to refer to the relevant extract from the Law Commission’s 221st report of April, 2009. After noting amendment made to Section 378 the Law Commission stated as under:

“2.9 All appeals against orders of acquittal passed by Magistrates were being filed in High Court prior to amendment of Section 378 by Act 25 of 2005. Now, with effect from 23.06.2006, appeals against orders of acquittal passed by Magistrates in respect of cognizable and non-bailable offences in cases filed on police report are being filed in the Sessions Court, vide clause (a) of sub-section (1) of the said section. But, appeal against order of acquittal passed in any case instituted upon complaint continues to be filed in the High Court, if special leave is granted by it on an application made to it by the complainant, vide sub-section (4) of the said section.
2.10 Section 378 needs change with a view to enable filing of appeals in complaint cases also in the Sessions Court, of course, subject to the grant of special leave by it.” These two extracts of the Law Commission’s report make it clear that though the words ‘police report’ are not mentioned in Section 378(1) (a), the Law Commission noted that the effect of the amendment was that all appeals against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence in cases filed on police report are being filed in the Sessions Court. The Law Commission lamented that there is no provision enabling filing of appeal in complaint cases in the Sessions Court subject to the grant of special leave by it. Thus, the Law Commission acknowledged that there is no provision in the Code under which appeals in complaint cases could be filed in the Sessions Court. We agree with this opinion for reasons which we shall now state.

14. Having analysed un-amended Section 378 it is necessary to have a look at Section 378 of the Code, as amended by Act 25 of 2005. It reads as under:

“378. Appeal in case of acquittal.
[(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2) and subject to the provisions of subsections (3) and (5), -
 
(a) the District Magistrate may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non- bailable offence;
 
(b) the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (a)] [or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision].
 
(2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code. [the Central Government may, subject to the provisions of sub- section (3), also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal-
 
(a) to the Court of Session, from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;
 
(b) to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (a)] or an order of acquittal] passed by the Court of Session in revision.]   (3)[No appeal to the High Court] under subsection (1) or subsection (2) shall be entertained except with the leave of the High Court.
 
(4) If such an order of' acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon Complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf, grants, special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant may present such an appeal to the High Court.
 
(5) No application under subsection (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal.
 
(6) If in any case, the application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub- section (1) or under subsection (2).”
15. At the outset, it must be noted that as per Section 378(3) appeals against orders of acquittal which have to be filed in the High Court under Section 378(1)(b) and 378(2)(b) of the Code cannot be entertained except with the leave of the High Court. Section 378(1)(a) provides that, in any case, if an order of acquittal is passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence the District Magistrate may direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the court of Sessions. Sub- Section (1)(b) of Section 378 provides that, in any case, the State Government may direct the Public Prosecutor to file an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any court other than a High Court not being an order under clause (a) or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision. Sub-Section(2) of Section 378 refers to orders of acquittal passed in any case investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than the Code. This provision is similar to sub-section(1) except that here the words ‘State Government’ are substituted by the words ‘Central Government’.

16. If we analyse Section 378(1)(a) & (b), it is clear that the State Government cannot direct the Public Prosecutor to file an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence because of the categorical bar created by Section 378(1)(b). Such appeals, that is appeals against orders of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence can only be filed in the Sessions Court at the instance of the Public Prosecutor as directed by the District Magistrate. Section 378(1)(b) uses the words “in any case” but leaves out orders of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence from the control of the State Government. Therefore, in all other cases where orders of acquittal are passed appeals can be filed by the Public Prosecutor as directed by the State Government to the High Court.

17. Sub-Section (4) of Section 378 makes provision for appeal against an order of acquittal passed in case instituted upon complaint. It states that in such case if the complainant makes an application to the High Court and the High Court grants special leave to appeal, the complainant may present such an appeal to the High Court. This sub-section speaks of ‘special leave’ as against sub-section (3) relating to other appeals which speaks of ‘leave’. Thus, complainant’s appeal against an order of acquittal is a category by itself. The complainant could be a private person or a public servant. This is evident from sub-section (5) which refers to application filed for ‘special leave’ by the complainant. It grants six months period of limitation to a complainant who is a public servant and sixty days in every other case for filing application. Sub- Section (6) is important. It states that if in any case complainant’s application for ‘special leave’ under sub-Section (4) is refused no appeal from order of acquittal shall lie under sub-section (1) or under sub- section (2). Thus, if ‘special leave’ is not granted to the complainant to appeal against an order of acquittal the matter must end there. Neither the District Magistrate not the State Government can appeal against that order of acquittal. The idea appears to be to accord quietus to the case in such a situation.

18. Since the words ‘police report’ are dropped from Section 378(1) (a) despite the Law Commission’s recommendation, it is not necessary to dwell on it. A police report is defined under Section 2(r) of the Code to mean a report forwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under sub-section (2) of Section 173 of the Code. It is a culmination of investigation by the police into an offence after receiving information of a cognizable or a non- cognizable offence. Section 2(d) defines a complaint to mean any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under the Code, that some person, whether known or unknown has committed an offence, but does not include a police report. Explanation to Section 2(d) states that a report made by a police officer in a case which discloses after investigation, the commission of a non- cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a complaint, and the police officer by whom such report is made shall be deemed to be the complainant. Sometimes investigation into cognizable offence conducted under Section 154 of the Code may culminate into a complaint case (cases under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940). Under the PFA Act, cases are instituted on filing of a complaint before the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate as specified in Section 20 of the PFA Act and offences under the PFA Act are both cognizable and non-cognizable. Thus, whether a case is a case instituted on a complaint depends on the legal provisions relating to the offence involved therein. But once it is a case instituted on a complaint and an order of acquittal is passed, whether the offence be bailable or non- bailable, cognizable or non-cognizable, the complainant can file an application under Section 378(4) for special leave to appeal against it in the High Court. Section 378(4) places no restriction on the complainant. So far as the State is concerned, as per Section 378(1)(b), it can in any case, that is even in a case instituted on a complaint, direct the Public Prosecutor to file an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any court other than High Court. But there is, as stated by us hereinabove, an important inbuilt and categorical restriction on the State’s power. It cannot direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-cognizable offence. In such a case the District Magistrate may under Section 378(1)(a) direct the Public Prosecutor to file an appeal to the Session Court. This appears to be the right approach and correct interpretation of Section 378 of the Code.

19. Mr. Malhotra is right in submitting that it is only when Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 was amended in 1955 that the complainant was given a right to seek special leave from the High Court to file an appeal to challenge an acquittal order. Section 417 was replaced by Section 378 in the Code. It contained similar provision. But, Act No.25 of 2005 brought about a major amendment in the Code. It introduced Section 378(1)(a) which permitted the District Magistrate, in any case, to direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence. For the first time a provision was introduced whereunder an appeal against an order of acquittal could be filed in the Sessions Court. Such appeals were restricted to orders passed by a Magistrate in cognizable and non-bailable offences. Section 378(1)(b) specifically and in clear words placed a restriction on the State’s right to file such appeals. It states that the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any court other than a High Court not being an order under clause (a) or an order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court in revision. Thus, the State Government cannot present an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence. We have already noted Clause 37 of the 154th Report of the Law Commission of India and Clause 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 1994 which state that in order to guard against the arbitrary exercise of power and to reduce reckless acquittals Section 378 was sought to be amended to provide appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of cognizable and non-bailable offence. Thus, this step is taken by the legislature to check arbitrary and reckless acquittals. It appears that being conscious of rise in unmerited acquittals, in case of certain acquittals, the legislature has enabled the District Magistrate to direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Sessions Court, thereby avoiding the tedious and time consuming procedure of approaching the State with a proposal, getting it sanctioned and then filing an appeal.

20. It is true that the State has an overall control over the law and order and public order of the area under its jurisdiction. Till Section 378 was amended by Act 25 of 2005 the State could prefer appeals against all acquittal orders. But the major amendment made in Section 378 by Act 25 of 2005 cannot be ignored. It has a purpose. It does not throw the concern of security of the community to the winds. In fact, it makes filing of appeals against certain types of acquittal orders described in Section 378(1)(a) easier, less cumbersome and less time consuming. The judgments cited by Mr. Malhotra pertain to Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and Section 378 prior to its amendment by Act 25 of 2005 and will, therefore, have no relevance to the present case.

21. In view of the above, we conclude that a complainant can file an application for special leave to appeal against an order of acquittal of any kind only to the High Court. He cannot file such appeal in the Sessions Court. In the instant case the complaint alleging offences punishable under Section 16(1)(1A) read with Section 7 of the PFA Act and the Rules is filed by complainant Shri Jaiswal, Local Health Authority through Delhi Administration. The appellant was acquitted by the Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi. The complainant can challenge the order of acquittal by filing an application for special leave to appeal in the Delhi High Court and not in the Sessions Court. Therefore, the impugned order holding that this case is not governed by Section 378(4) of the Code is quashed and set aside. In the circumstances the appeal is allowed.",1
SANJAY VERMA ,". This quantum appeal is by the claimant seeking further enhancement of the compensation awarded by the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital by its Order dated 27.03.2006.

2. The facts relevant for the purpose of the present adjudication may be noticed at the outset.

On 12.08.1998 the appellant-claimant was travelling from Ambala to Kurukshetra in a bus belonging to the Haryana Roadways and bearing registration No. HR-07PA-0197. On the way the driver of the bus lost control over the vehicle resulting in an accident in the course of which the claimant suffered multiple injuries. He was initially treated in the civil hospital Pehwa and thereafter transferred to the PGIMER, Chandigarh on 14.08.1998. The appellant underwent surgery on 16.09.1998 and eventually he was released from the hospital and referred to the Rehabilitation Centre, Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital, Aligarh. According to the claimant, apart from other injuries, he had suffered a fracture of the spinal cord resulting in paralysis of his whole body. In these circumstances the claimant filed an application before the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal claiming compensation of a total sum of Rs.53,00,000/- under different heads enumerated below:

|(i)     |Pecuniary loss                        |Rs. 24,00,000.00    |
|(ii)    |Expenditure incurred in               |Rs.   2,00,000.00   |
|        |treatment till now                    |                    |
|        |                                      |                    |
|(iii)   |Expenses which shall be               |Rs.  3,00,000.00    |
|        |incurred in future in treatment       |                    |
|(iv)    |Cost of attendant from the            |Rs.  2,00,000.00    |
|        |date of accident till he remains      |                    |
|        |alive                                 |                    |
|(v)     |Passage and diet money                | Rs.  2,00,000.00   |
|(vi)    |Pain and suffering and                |Rs. 20,00,000.00    |
|        |mental agony                          |                    |
|        |Total                                 |Rs.53,00,000.00     |


3. The learned Tribunal by its Award dated 12.06.2000 held that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus and that the claimant is entitled to compensation. The total amount due to the claimant was quantified at Rs. 3,00,000/- under the heads “Loss of Income”, “reimbursement of medical expenses” and “pain and suffering”. The learned Tribunal also awarded interest at the rate of 9% from 24.08.1999 i.e. the date of filing of the claim application till date of payment.

4. Aggrieved, the claimant filed an appeal before the High Court which enhanced the compensation to Rs.8,08,052/-. The High Court quantified the amount due to the claimant towards “loss of income” at Rs.6,19,500/-; Rs.1,38,552/- on account of “medical expenses” and an amount of Rs.50,000/- “for future treatment” and “pain and suffering”. The High Court, however, reduced the interest payable to 6% per annum from the date of the filing of the application. Aggrieved, this appeal has been filed.

5. We have heard Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned counsel for the appellant- claimant and Dr. Monika Gusain, learned counsel for the respondent.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that in computing the amount due to the appellant on account of loss of income, future prospects of increase of income had not been taken into account by the High Court; the multiplier adopted by the courts below is 15 whereas the correct multiplier should have been 18. In so far as the amount awarded for “future treatment” and “pain and suffering” is concerned, learned counsel has submitted that not only the amount of Rs.50,000/- is grossly inadequate but High Court has committed an error in clubbing the two heads together for award of compensation. In this regard the learned counsel has drawn the attention of the Court to the amounts claimed in the claim petition under the aforesaid two heads, as already noticed hereinabove. It is submitted by the learned counsel that the amount of compensation is liable to be enhanced.

7. Controverting the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant, Dr. Monika Gusain learned counsel for the respondent-Haryana Roadways has submitted that the enhancement made by the High Court to the extent of over Rs.5,00,000/- is more than an adequate measure of the “just compensation” that the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter for short the “Act”) contemplate. It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that in awarding the enhanced amount the High Court has taken into account all the relevant circumstances for due computation of the amount of compensation payable under the Act.

8. Before proceeding any further it would be appropriate to take note of the evidence tendered by PW-1, Dr. Shailendra Kumar Mishra, who was examined in the case on behalf of the claimant. The relevant part of the evidence of PW-1 is extracted below:

“………..Medical Board granted 80% disability of Sanjay Verma during the course of examination. Today I re-examined Mr. Sanjay Verma in the Court, at the time of issuance of certificate, it was the opinion that his condition may improve, but even after such a long duration his condition has deteriorated, in place of improvement.
Today he has become cent percent paralyzed. Now Sanjay Verma is unable to perform his day to day needs such as latrine and urination could not be done of his own. A tube has been inserted into his urinary tract along with a bag which he has to use entire life. There will be no control over his toilet and urine which he might have been doing on his bed.
He will not be able to move throughout his life due to the paralysis below waist and he is now not been able to do any work. The Spinal chord will be pressurized due to the facture of back bone and he will have to bear the pain throughout his life. Sanjay Verma will not be able to lead his normal life and will have remain in the same condition throughout his life. Due to his laying position he will be effected by bed sores which will be excessive painful. Due to lack of urination in normal course his kidney may be damaged and this possibility will always remain.” “………At the time of issuance of handicapped certificate I had also given 100% disability certificate but thinking that he might improve, I had given a certificate 80% disability. The cutting over the certificate No.16 G has been done by me which bears my signature. This cutting was also done at the time of issuance of the certificate. As per the prescribed standard, at the time when patient was examined by the medical board, he was also suffering from the total paralysis and 100% disability but because patient’s toe was having slight movement, therefore, it was unanimously decided that for the time being his disability is 80%.”
9. It is also established by the materials on record that the age of the claimant at the time of the accident was 25 years and he was married. The age of his wife was 22 years and at the time of the accident the claimant had one son who was 1½ years of age. Apart from the above, from the deposition of the claimant himself (PW-2) it transpires that after the accident he is not able to do any work and “one person is always needed to look after him”.

10. Having noticed the evidence of PW-1 Dr. Shailendra Kumar Mishra and the other facts and circumstances of the case we may now proceed to determine as to whether the compensation awarded by the High Court under the different heads noticed above is just and fair compensation within the meaning of Section 168 of the Act.

11. The appellant was a self employed person. Though he had claimed a monthly income of Rs.5,000/-, the Income Tax Returns filed by him demonstrate that he had paid income tax on an annual income of Rs.41,300/-. No fault, therefore, can be found in the order of the High Court which proceeds on the basis that the annual income of the claimant at the time of the accident was Rs.41,300/-. Though in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and Others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another[1] this Court had held that in case of a self employed person, unless there are special and exceptional circumstances, the annual income at the time of death is to be taken into account, a Coordinate Bench in Santosh Devi vs. National Insurance Company Ltd. and Others[2] has taken a different view which is to the following effect:

“14. We find it extremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the observation made in para 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma case that where the deceased was self-employed or was on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., the courts will usually take only the actual income at the time of death and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. In our view, it will be naïve to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a person who is self-employed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would remain the same throughout his life.”
12. The view taken in Santosh Devi (supra) has been reiterated by a Bench of three Judges in Rajesh and Others vs. Rajbir Singh and Others[3] by holding as follows :

“8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it applicable also to the self- employed and persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. Needless to say that the actual income should be income after paying the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years.
9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition. Having regard to the fact that in the case of those self-employed or on fixed wages, where there is normally no age of superannuation, we are of the view that it will only be just and equitable to provide an addition of 15% in the case where the victim is between the age group of 50 to 60 years so as to make the compensation just, equitable, fair and reasonable. There shall normally be no addition thereafter.”
13. Certain parallel developments will now have to be taken note of. In Reshma Kumari and Others vs. Madan Mohan and Another[4], a two Judge Bench of this Court while considering the following questions took the view that the issue(s) needed resolution by a larger Bench “(1) Whether the multiplier specified in the Second Schedule appended to the Act should be scrupulously applied in all the cases?

(2) Whether for determination of the multiplicand, the Act provides for any criterion, particularly as regards determination of future prospects?”

14. Answering the above reference a three Judge Bench of this Court in Reshma Kumari and Ors. vs. Madan Mohan and Anr.[5] reiterated the view taken in Sarla Verma (supra) to the effect that in respect of a person who was on a fixed salary without provision for annual increments or who was self-employed the actual income at the time of death should be taken into account for determining the loss of income unless there are extraordinary and exceptional circumstances. Though the expression “exceptional and extraordinary circumstances” is not capable of any precise definition, in Shakti Devi vs. New India Insurance Company Limited and Another[6] there is a practical application of the aforesaid principle. The near certainty of the regular employment of the deceased in a government department following the retirement of his father was held to be a valid ground to compute the loss of income by taking into account the possible future earnings. The said loss of income, accordingly, was quantified at double the amount that the deceased was earning at the time of his death.

15. Undoubtedly, the same principle will apply for determination of loss of income on account of an accident resulting in the total disability of the victim as in the present case. Therefore, taking into account the age of the claimant (25 years) and the fact that he had a steady income, as evidenced by the income-tax returns, we are of the view that an addition of 50% to the income that the claimant was earning at the time of the accident would be justified.

16. Insofar as the multiplier is concerned, as held in Sarla Verma (supra) (para 42) or as prescribed under the Second Schedule to the Act, the correct multiplier in the present case cannot be 15 as held by the High Court. We are of the view that the adoption of the multiplier of 17 would be appropriate. Accordingly, taking into account the addition to the income and the higher multiplier the total amount of compensation payable to the claimant under the head “loss of income” is Rs. 10,53,150/- (Rs. 41300 + Rs. 20650= Rs. 61,950 x 17).

17. In so far as the medical expenses is concerned as the awarded amount of Rs.1,38,552/- has been found payable on the basis of the bills/vouchers etc. brought on record by the claimant we will have no occasion to cause any alteration of the amount of compensation payable under the head “medical expenses”. Accordingly, the finding of the High Court in this regard is maintained.

18. This will bring us to the grievance of the appellant-claimant with regard to award of compensation of Rs.50,000/- under the head “future treatment” and “pain and suffering”. In view of the decisions of this Court in Raj Kumar vs. Ajay Kumar and Another[7] and Sanjay Batham vs. Munnalal Parihar and Others[8] there can be no manner of doubt that the above two heads of compensation are distinct and different and cannot be clubbed together. We will, therefore, have to severe the two heads which have been clubbed together by the High Court.

In so far as “future treatment” is concerned we have no doubt that the claimant will be required to take treatment from time to time even to maintain the present condition of his health. In fact, the claimant in his deposition has stated that he is undergoing treatment at the Apollo Hospital at Delhi. Though it is not beyond our powers to award compensation beyond what has been claimed [Nagappa vs. Gurudayal Singh and others[9]], in the facts of the present case we are of the view that the grant of full compensation, as claimed in the claim petition i.e. Rs.3,00,000/- under the head “future treatment”, would meet the ends of justice. We, therefore, order accordingly.

19. The claimant had claimed an amount of Rs.20,00,000/- under the head “pain and suffering and mental agony”. Considering the injuries sustained by the claimant which had left him paralyzed for life and the evidence of PW-1 to the effect that the claimant is likely to suffer considerable pain throughout his life, we are of the view that the claimant should be awarded a further sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- on account of “pain and suffering”. We must, however, acknowledge that monetary compensation for pain and suffering is at best a palliative, the correct dose of which, in the last analysis, will have to be determined on a case to case basis.

20. In the claim petition filed before the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal the claimant has prayed for an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- being the cost of attendant from the date of accident till he remains alive. The claimant in his deposition had stated that “he needs one person to be with him all the time”. The aforesaid statement of the claimant is duly supported by the evidence of PW-1 who has described the medical condition of the claimant in detail. From the aforesaid materials, we are satisfied that the claim made on this count is justified and the amount of Rs.2,00,000/- claimed by the claimant under the aforesaid head should be awarded in full. We order accordingly.

21. In view of the discussions that have preceded, we hold that the claimant is entitled to enhanced compensation as set out in the table below:

|Sl. |Head                    |Amt. as per High   |Amt. as per this  |

22. In view of the enhancement made by us, we do not consider it necessary to modify the rate of interest awarded by the High Court i.e. 6% from the date of the application i.e. 24.08.1999 to the date of payment which will also be payable on the enhanced amount of compensation.",1

"STATE OF TAMILNADU BY INS.OF POLICE
VIGILANCE AND ANTI CORRUPTION   ","CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.22-23 OF 2014 (@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION(CRL.)Nos.3810- 3811 of 2012) The State of Tamil Nadu aggrieved by the order dated 10th of December, 2010 passed by the Madras High Court in Criminal R.C.No.528 of 2009 and Criminal M.P.(MD) No.1 of 2009, setting aside the order dated 25th of September, 2009 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate-cum-Special Judge, Nagercoil (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Special Judge’), whereby he refused to discharge the respondents, has preferred these special leave petitions.

Leave granted.

Short facts giving rise to the present appeals are that Respondent No. 1, N. Suresh Rajan, during the period from 13.05.1996 to 14.05.2001, was a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly as also a State Minister of Tourism. Respondent No. 2, K. Neelkanda Pillai is his father and Respondent No. 3, R.Rajam, his mother. On the basis of an information that N. Suresh Rajan, during his tenure as the Minister of Tourism, had acquired and was in possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the names of his father and mother, disproportionate to his known sources of income, Crime No. 7 of 2002 was registered at Kanyakumari Vigilance and Anti Corruption Department on 14th of March, 2002 against the Minister N. Suresh Rajan, his father, mother, elder sister and his bother- in-law. During the course of the investigation, the investigating officer collected and gathered informations with regard to the property and pecuniary resources in possession of N. Suresh Rajan during his tenure as the Minister, in his name and in the name of others. On computation of the income of the Minister from his known sources and also expenditure incurred by him, it was found that the properties owned and possessed by him are disproportionate to his known sources of income to the tune of Rs. 23,77,950.94. The investigating officer not only examined the accused Minister but also his father and mother as also his sister and the brother- in-law. Ultimately, the investigating agency came to the conclusion that during the check period, Respondent No.1, N. Suresh Rajan has acquired and was in possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the names of his father, K. Neelakanda Pillai (Respondent No. 2) and mother R. Rajam (Respondent No. 3) and his wife D.S. Bharathi for total value of Rs. 17,58,412.47. The investigating officer also came to the conclusion that Minister’s father and mother never had any independent source of income commensurate with the property and pecuniary resources found acquired in their names. Accordingly, the investigating officer submitted the charge-sheet dated 4th of July, 2003 against Respondent No.1, the Minister and his father (Respondent No.2) and mother (Respondent No.3) respectively, alleging commission of an offence under Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Respondents filed application dated 5th of December, 2003 under Section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Code’), seeking their discharge. The Special Judge, by its order dated 25th of September, 2009 rejected their prayer. While doing so, the Special Judge observed as follows:

“At this stage it will be premature to say that there are no sufficient materials on the side of the state to frame any charge against them and the same would not be according to law in the opinion of this court and at the same time this court has come to know that there are basic materials for the purpose of framing charges against the 3 petitioners, the petition filed by the petitioners is dismissed and orders passed to that effect.” Aggrieved by the same, respondents filed criminal revision before the High Court. The High Court by the impugned judgment had set aside the order of the Special Judge and discharged the respondents on its finding that in the absence of any material to show that money passed from respondent No. 1 to his mother and father, latter cannot be said to be holding the property and resources in their names on behalf of their son.
The High Court while passing the impugned order heavily relied on its earlier judgment in the case of State by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption Cuddalore Detachment v. K. Ponumudi & Ors. (2007-1MLJ-CRL.-100), the validity whereof is also under consideration in the connected appeals. The High Court while allowing the criminal revision observed as follows:

“12.In the instant case, the properties standing in the name of the petitioners 2 and 3 namely, A2 and A3 could not be held to be the properties or resources belonging to the 1st accused in the absence of any investigation into the individual income resources of A2 and A3. Moreover, it is not disputed that A2 was a retired Head Master receiving pension and A3 is running a Financial Institution and an Income Tax assessee. In the absence of any material to show that A1’s money flow into the hands of A2 and A3, they cannot be said to be holding the properties and resources in their name on behalf of the first accused. There is also no material to show that A2 and A3 instigated A1 to acquire properties and resources disproportionate to his known source of income.” It is in these circumstances that the appellant is before us.
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.26-38 OF 2014 (@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION(CRL.)Nos. 134-146 of 2013) These special leave petitions are barred by limitation. There is delay of 1954 days in filing the petitions and 217 days in refiling the same. Applications have been filed for condoning the delay in filing and refiling the special leave petitions.

Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that the delay in filing the special leave petitions has occurred as the Public Prosecutor earlier gave an opinion that it is not a fit case in which special leave petitions deserve to be filed. The Government accepted the opinion and decided not to file the special leave petitions. It is pointed out that the very Government in which one of the accused was a Minister had taken the aforesaid decision not to file special leave petitions. However, after the change of the Government, opinion was sought from the Advocate General, who opined that it is fit case in which the order impugned deserves to be challenged. Accordingly, it is submitted that the cause shown is sufficient to condone the delay.

Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents, however, submits that mere change of Government would not be sufficient to condone the inordinate delay. He submits that with the change of the Government, many issues which have attained finality would be reopened after long delay, which should not be allowed. According to him, condonation of huge delay on the ground that the successor Government, which belongs to a different political party, had taken the decision to file the special leave petitions would be setting a very dangerous precedent and it would lead to miscarriage of justice. He emphasizes that there is a life span for every legal remedy and condonation of delay is an exception. Reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 563, and our attention has been drawn to Paragraph 29 of the judgment, which reads as follows:

“29. In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for several months/years due to considerable degree of procedural red tape in the process. The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few.” Mr. Sorabjee further submits that the Limitation Act does not provide for different period of limitation for the Government in resorting to the remedy provided under the law and the case in hand being not a case of fraud or collusion by its officers or agents, the huge delay is not fit to be condoned. Reliance has also been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Pundlik Jalam Patil v. Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium Project, (2008) 17 SCC 448 and reference has been made to Paragraph 31 of the judgment, which reads as follows:
“31. It is true that when the State and its instrumentalities are the applicants seeking condonation of delay they may be entitled to certain amount of latitude but the law of limitation is same for citizen and for governmental authorities. The Limitation Act does not provide for a different period to the Government in filing appeals or applications as such. It would be a different matter where the Government makes out a case where public interest was shown to have suffered owing to acts of fraud or collusion on the part of its officers or agents and where the officers were clearly at cross purposes with it. In a given case if any such facts are pleaded or proved they cannot be excluded from consideration and those factors may go into the judicial verdict. In the present case, no such facts are pleaded and proved though a feeble attempt by the learned counsel for the respondent was made to suggest collusion and fraud but without any basis. We cannot entertain the submission made across the Bar without there being any proper foundation in the pleadings.” The contentions put forth by Mr. Sorabjee are weighty, deserving thoughtful consideration and at one point of time we were inclined to reject the applications filed for condonation of delay and dismiss the special leave petitions. However, on a second thought we find that the validity of the order impugned in these special leave petitions has to be gone into in criminal appeals arising out of Special Leave Petitions (Criminal) Nos. 3810-3811 of 2012 and in the face of it, it shall be unwise to dismiss these special leave petitions on the ground of limitation. It is worth mentioning here that the order impugned in the criminal appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos. 3810-3811 of 2012, State of Tamil Nadu by Ins. of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption v. N.
Suresh Rajan & Ors., has been mainly rendered, relying on the decision in State by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption Cuddalore Detachment vs. K. Ponmudi and Ors.(2007-1MLJ-CRL.-100), which is impugned in the present special leave petitions. In fact, by order dated 3rd of January, 2013, these petitions were directed to be heard along with the aforesaid special leave petitions. In such circumstances, we condone the delay in filing and refiling the special leave petitions.
In these petitions the State of Tamil Nadu impugns the order dated 11th of August, 2006 passed by the Madras High Court whereby the revision petitions filed against the order of discharge dated 21st of July, 2004 passed by the Special Judge/Chief Judicial Magistrate, Villupuram (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Special Judge’), in the Special Case No. 7 of 2003, have been dismissed.

Leave granted.

Shorn of unnecessary details, facts giving rise to the present appeals are that K. Ponumudi, respondent No. 1 herein, happened to be a Member of the State Legislative Assembly and a State Minister in the Tamil Nadu Government during the check period. P. Visalakshi Ponmudi (Respondent No.2) is his wife, whereas P.Saraswathi (Respondent No.3) (since deceased) was his mother-in-law. A.Manivannan (Respondent No.4) and A.Nandagopal (Respondent No.5) (since deceased) are the friends of the Minister (Respondent No.1). Respondent Nos. 3 to 5 during their lifetime were trustees of one Siga Educational Trust, Villupuram.

In the present appeals, we have to examine the validity of the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge as affirmed by the High Court. Hence, we consider it unnecessary to go into the details of the case of the prosecution or the defence of the respondent at this stage. Suffice it to say that, according to the prosecution, K. Ponmudi (Respondent No.1), as a Minister of Transport and a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly during the period from 13.05.1996 to 30.09.2001, had acquired and was in possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the names of his wife and sons, which were disproportionate to his known sources of income. Accordingly, Crime No. 4 of 2002 was registered at Cuddalore Village, Anti-Corruption Department on 14th of March, 2002 under Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 13(2) and Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’. During the course of investigation it transpired that between the period from 13.05.1996 to 31.03.2002, the Minister had acquired and possessed properties at Mathirimangalam, Kaspakaranai, Kappiampuliyur villages and other places in Villupuram Taluk, at Vittalapuram village and other places in Thindivanam Taluk, at Cuddalore and Pondicherry Towns, at Chennai and Trichy cities and at other places. It is alleged that respondent No.1-Minister being a public servant committed the offence of criminal misconduct by acquiring and being in possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the names of his wife, mother- in-law and also in the name of Siga Educational Trust, held by the other respondents on behalf of Respondent No. 1, the Minister, which were disproportionate to his known sources of income to the extent of Rs.3,08,35,066.97. According to the prosecution, he could not satisfactorily account for the assets and in this way, the Minister had committed the offence punishable under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Act.

In the course of investigation, it further transpired that during the check period and in the places stated above, other accused abetted the Minister in the commission of the offence by him. Respondent No. 2, the wife of the Minister, aided in commission of the offence by holding on his behalf a substantial portion of properties and pecuniary resources in her name as well as in the name of M/s. Visal Expo, of which she was the sole Proprietor. Similarly, Respondent No. 3, the mother-in-law, aided the Minister by holding on his behalf a substantial portion of properties and pecuniary resources in her name as well as in the name of Siga Educational Trust by purporting to be one of its Trustees. Similarly, Respondent No. 4 and Respondent No. 5 aided the Minister and held on his behalf a substantial portion of the properties and pecuniary resources in the name of Siga Educational Trust by purporting to be its Trustees. It is relevant here to mention that during the course of investigation, the statement of all other accused were taken and in the opinion of the investigating agency, after due scrutiny of their statements and further verification, the Minister was not able to satisfactorily account for the quantum of disproportionate assets. Accordingly, the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Department of the State Government submitted charge-sheet against the respondents under Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Act.

It is relevant here to state that the offences punishable under the scheme of the Act have to be tried by a Special Judge and he may take cognizance of the offence without commitment of the accused and the Judge trying the accused is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases by the Magistrate. The Special Judge holding the trial is deemed to be a Court of Sessions. The respondents filed petition for discharge under Section 239 of the Code inter alia contending that the system which the prosecution had followed to ascertain the income of the accused is wrong. Initially, the check period was from 10.05.1996 to 13.09.2001 which, during the investigation, was enlarged from 13.05.1996 to 31.03.2002. Not only this, according to the accused, the income was undervalued and the expenditures exaggerated. According to Respondent No. 1, the Minister, income of the individual property of his wife and that of his mother-in-law and their expenditure ought not to have been shown as his property. According to him, the allegation that the properties in their names are his benami properties is wrong. It was also contended that the valuation of the properties has been arrived at without taking into consideration the entire income and expenditure of Respondent No. 1. Respondents have also alleged that the investigating officer, who is the informant of the case, had acted autocratically and his action is vitiated by bias. The Special Judge examined all these contentions and by order dated 21st of July, 2004 discharged Respondents on its finding that the investigation was not conducted properly. The Special Judge further held that the value of the property of Respondent Nos. 2 to 5 ought not to have been clubbed with that of the individual properties and income of Respondent No. 1 and by doing so, the assets of Respondent No. 1 cannot be said to be disproportionate to his known sources of income. On the aforesaid finding the Special Judge discharged all the accused. Aggrieved by the same, the State of Tamil Nadu filed separate revision petitions and the High Court, by the impugned order, has dismissed all the revision petitions. The High Court, while affirming the order of discharge, held that the prosecution committed an error by adding the income of other respondents, who were assessed under the Income Tax Act, in the income of Respondent No.1. In the opinion of the High Court, an independent and unbiased scrutiny of the entire documents furnished along with the final report would not make out any ground of framing of charges against any of the accused persons. While doing so, the High Court has observed as follows:

“18. The assets which admittedly, do not belong to Accused 1 and owned by individuals having independent source of income which are assessed under the Income Tax Act, were added as the assets of Accused -1. Such a procedure adopted by the prosecution is not only unsustainable but also illegal. An independent and unbiased scrutiny of the entire documents furnished along with the final report would not make out any ground for framing of charge as against any of the accused persons. The methodology adopted by the prosecution to establish the disproportionate assets with reference to the known source of income is absolutely erroneous.
xxx xxx xxx The theory of Benami is totally alien to the concept of trust and it is not legally sustainable to array the accused 3 to 5 as holders of the properties or that they are the benamies of the accused. The benami transaction has to be proved by the prosecution by producing legally permissible materials of a bona fide character which would directly prove the fact of benami and there is a total lack of materials on this account and hence the theory of benami has not been established even remotely by any evidence. On a prima-facie evidence it is evident that the other accused are possessed of sufficient funds for acquiring their properties and that A1 has nothing to do with those properties and that he cannot be called upon to explain the source of income of the acquisition made by other persons.
19……… Admittedly the accused are not possessed of the properties standing in the name of Trust and controlled by the Accused A3 to A5. The trust is an independent legal entity assessed to income tax and owning the properties. Only to boost the value of the assets the prosecution belatedly arrayed the Trustees of the Trust as accused 3 to 5 in order to foist a false case as against A1.
xxx xxx xxx 21………All the properties acquired by A2 and A3 in their individual capacity acquired out of their own income have been shown in the Income Tax Returns, which fact the prosecution also knows and also available in the records of the prosecution. The prosecution has no justification or reason to disregard those income tax returns to disallow such income while filing the final report. The documents now available on record also would clearly disprove the claim of benami transaction.” The High court ultimately concluded as follows:
“24…………Therefore, the trial court analyzing the materials and documents that were made available at the stage of framing charges and on their face value arrived at the right conclusion that charges could not be framed against the respondents/accused.” Now we proceed to consider the legal position concerning the issue of discharge and validity of the orders impugned in these appeals in the background thereof. Mr. Ranjit Kumar submits that the order impugned suffers from patent illegality. He points out that at the time of framing of the charge the scope is limited and what is to be seen at this stage is as to whether on examination of the materials and the documents collected, the charge can be said to be groundless or not. He submits that at this stage, the court cannot appraise the evidence as is done at the time of trial. He points out that while passing the impugned orders, the evidence has been appraised and the case of the prosecution has been rejected, as is done after the trial while acquitting the accused.
Mr. Sorabjee as also Mr. N.V. Ganesh appearing on behalf of the respondents-accused, however, submit that when the court considers the applications for discharge, it has to examine the materials for the purpose of finding out as to whether the allegation made is groundless or not.
They submit that at the time of consideration of an application for discharge, nothing prevents the court to sift and weigh the evidence for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether the allegations made on the basis of the materials and the documents collected are groundless or not. They also contend that the court while considering such an application cannot act merely as a post-office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution. In support of the submission, reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Sajjan Kumar v. CBI, (2010) 9 SCC 368 and our attention has been drawn to Paragraph 17(4) of the judgment, which reads as follows:

“17. In Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal & Anr., 1979 (3) SCC 4, the scope of Section 227 CrPC was considered. After adverting to various decisions, this Court has enumerated the following principles:
xxx xxx xxx (4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code the Judge which under the present Code is a senior and experienced court cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on. This however does not mean that the Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.” Yet another decision on which reliance has been placed is the decision of this Court in the case of Dilawar Balu Kurane v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 2 SCC 135, reference has been made to the following paragraph of the said judgment:
“12. Now the next question is whether a prima facie case has been made out against the appellant. In exercising powers under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the settled position of law is that the Judge while considering the question of framing the charges under the said section has the undoubted power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out; where the materials placed before the court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not been properly explained the court will be fully justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial; by and large if two views are equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully justified to discharge the accused, and in exercising jurisdiction under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Judge cannot act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before the court but should not make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.” We have bestowed our consideration to the rival submissions and the submissions made by Mr. Ranjit Kumar commend us. True it is that at the time of consideration of the applications for discharge, the court cannot act as a mouthpiece of the prosecution or act as a post-office and may sift evidence in order to find out whether or not the allegations made are groundless so as to pass an order of discharge. It is trite that at the stage of consideration of an application for discharge, the court has to proceed with an assumption that the materials brought on record by the prosecution are true and evaluate the said materials and documents with a view to find out whether the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At this stage, probative value of the materials has to be gone into and the court is not expected to go deep into the matter and hold that the materials would not warrant a conviction. In our opinion, what needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has been committed and not whether a ground for convicting the accused has been made out. To put it differently, if the court thinks that the accused might have committed the offence on the basis of the materials on record on its probative value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the court has to come to the conclusion that the accused has committed the offence. The law does not permit a mini trial at this stage.
Reference in this connection can be made to a recent decision of this Court in the case of Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat & Ors. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr., AIR 2013 SC 52, in which, after analyzing various decisions on the point, this Court endorsed the following view taken in Onkar Nath Mishra v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2008) 2 SCC 561:
“11. It is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging there from, taken at their face value, disclosed the existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At that stage, the court is not expected to go deep into the probative value of the material on record. What needs to be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence has been committed and not a ground for convicting the accused has been made out. At that stage, even strong suspicion founded on material which leads the court to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged would justify the framing of charge against the accused in respect of the commission of that offence.""
Now reverting to the decisions of this Court in the case Sajjan Kumar (supra) and Dilawar Balu Kurane (supra), relied on by the respondents, we are of the opinion that they do not advance their case. The aforesaid decisions consider the provision of Section 227 of the Code and make it clear that at the stage of discharge the Court can not make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as if it was conducting a trial. It is worth mentioning that the Code contemplates discharge of the accused by the Court of Sessions under Section 227 in a case triable by it; cases instituted upon a police report are covered by Section 239 and cases instituted otherwise than on a police report are dealt with in Section 245. From a reading of the aforesaid sections it is evident that they contain somewhat different provisions with regard to discharge of an accused. Under Section 227 of the Code, the trial court is required to discharge the accused if it “considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused”.
However, discharge under Section 239 can be ordered when “the Magistrate considers the charge against the accused to be groundless”. The power to discharge is exercisable under Section 245(1) when, “the Magistrate considers, for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which, if not repudiated, would warrant his conviction”. Section 227 and 239 provide for discharge before the recording of evidence on the basis of the police report, the documents sent along with it and examination of the accused after giving an opportunity to the parties to be heard. However, the stage of discharge under Section 245, on the other hand, is reached only after the evidence referred in Section 244 has been taken. Thus, there is difference in the language employed in these provisions. But, in our opinion, notwithstanding these differences, and whichever provision may be applicable, the court is required at this stage to see that there is a prima facie case for proceeding against the accused. Reference in this connection can be made to a judgment of this Court in the case of R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay, (1986) 2 SCC 716. The same reads as follows:

“43………………Notwithstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under Section 245(1) is a preliminary one and the test of “prima facie” case has to be applied. In spite of the difference in the language of the three sections, the legal position is that if the Trial court is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out, charge has to be framed.” Bearing in mind the principles aforesaid, we proceed to consider the facts of the present case. Here the allegation against the accused Minister (Respondent No.1), K. Ponmudi is that while he was a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and a State Minister, he had acquired and was in possession of the properties in the name of his wife as also his mother-in-law, who along with his other friends, were of Siga Educational Trust, Villupuram. According to the prosecution, the properties of Siga Educational Trust, Villupuram were held by other accused on behalf of the accused Minister. These properties, according to the prosecution, in fact, were the properties of K.Ponumudi. Similarly, accused N. Suresh Rajan has acquired properties disproportionate to his known sources of income in the names of his father and mother. While passing the order of discharge, the fact that the accused other than the two Ministers have been assessed to income tax and paid income tax cannot be relied upon to discharge the accused persons particularly in view of the allegation made by the prosecution that there was no separate income to amass such huge properties. The property in the name of an income tax assessee itself cannot be a ground to hold that it actually belongs to such an assessee. In case this proposition is accepted, in our opinion, it will lead to disastrous consequences. It will give opportunity to the corrupt public servants to amass property in the name of known persons, pay income tax on their behalf and then be out from the mischief of law. While passing the impugned orders, the court has not sifted the materials for the purpose of finding out whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused but whether that would warrant a conviction. We are of the opinion that this was not the stage where the court should have appraised the evidence and discharged the accused as if it was passing an order of acquittal. Further, defect in investigation itself cannot be a ground for discharge. In our opinion, the order impugned suffers from grave error and calls for rectification.
Any observation made by us in this judgment is for the purpose of disposal of these appeals and shall have no bearing on the trial. The surviving respondents are directed to appear before the respective courts on 3rd of February, 2014. The Court shall proceed with the trial from the stage of charge in accordance with law and make endeavour to dispose of the same expeditiously.",1
State of U.P. Thr. Exe. Engineer & Anr.," There is a delay of 481 days in filing this Special Leave Petition and by means of present application petitioner seeks condonation thereof.

2. In the application the petitioner has attributed the delay to the moving of file from one Department/ Officer to the other. We hardly find this to be a sufficient explanation for condoning such an abnormal delay. This Court in the case of Postmaster General and Ors. vs. Living Media India Ltd.; (2012) 3 SCC 563 has deprecated such practices on the part of the Government Authorities/ Departments in the following words:-

“It is not in dispute that the person(s) concerned were well aware or conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a Special Leave Petition in this Court. They cannot claim that they have a separate period of limitation when the Department was possessed with competent persons familiar with Court proceedings. In the absence of plausible and acceptable explanation, we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned mechanically merely because the Government or a wing of the Government is a party before us.
Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance substantial justice, we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances, Department cannot take advantage of various earlier decisions. The claim on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in view of the modern technologies being used and available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the Government.
In our view, it is the right time to inform all the government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities that unless they have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort, there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the file was kept pending for process. The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for the Government Departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few.
Considering the fact that there was no proper explanation offered by the Department for the delay except mentioning of various dates, according to us, the Department has miserably failed to give any acceptable and cogent reasons sufficient to condone such a huge delay. Accordingly, the appeals are liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay.
3. We further find that in identical circumstances in similar type of case which also arose against the award of the Labour Court, upheld by the High Court this court had refused to condone the delay and dismissed the Special Leave Petition on that ground. That was CC No. 5368/2013 titled State of U.P. & Ors. vs. Hanuman which was dismissed on 11.3.2013. We had summoned the file of that case and find both the cases are almost similar. Therefore, there is no reason to take a different view. We thus, dismiss this SLP on the ground of delay.",0
R. Unnikrishnan and Anr.,"Leave granted in Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.24775 of 2013.

2. Common questions of law arise for consideration in these appeals which shall stand disposed of by this common order. But before we formulate the questions that fall for determination the factual matrix in which the same arise need to be summarised for a proper appreciation of the controversy.

3. Respondent-V.K. Mahanudevan in Civil Appeal No.3468 of 2007 applied to Tehsildar, Alathur in the State of Kerala for grant of a Scheduled Caste Certificate on the basis that he was a ‘Thandan’ which was a notified Scheduled Caste. The Tehsildar held an enquiry and found that the appellant did not belong to the Scheduled Caste community and reported the matter to the Director, Scheduled Caste Development Department, who in turn forwarded the case to Director, Kerala Institute for Research, Training and Development Studies of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, (‘KIRTADS’ for short) for investigation and report.

4. Aggrieved by the denial of the certificate the respondent filed O.P. No.9216 of 1986 before the High Court of Kerala which was disposed of by the High Court in terms of its order dated 25th February, 1987 with a direction to the Tehsildar concerned to issue a caste certificate in favour of the said respondent. A certificate was accordingly issued in his favour. It is common ground that the respondent was appointed as an Assistant Executive Engineer under a special recruitment scheme for SC/ST candidates.

5. Long after the certificate had been issued in favour of the respondent and his appointment as an Assistant Executive Engineer in the State service, a Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in Kerala Pattika Jathi Samrekshana Samithy v. State AIR 1995 Ker 337 observed that a large number of applications for change of caste name from ‘Thiyya’ to ‘Thandan’ had been received pursuant to The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Act, 1976 and ordered that all such certificates as were corrected on the basis of such applications after 27th July, 1977 ought to be scrutinized by a Scrutiny Committee. The High Court observed:

“...The filing of a large number of applications for correction of the name of caste from Ezhava/Thiyya to Thandan alleging one and the same reason immediately after inclusion of Thandan community as Scheduled Caste in the 1976 order can prima facie be considered only as a concerted attempt on the part of Section of Ezhavas/Thiyyas to take advantage of the benefits of Scheduled Castes as alleged in the counter affidavit of the first respondent and asserted by the petitioner. It cannot be easily believed that if a person was really a Thandan and as such a Scheduled Caste, his caste would have been noted as Ezhava or Thiyya in the school records. It cannot also be believed easily that in large number of cases for no reason whatsoever the same type of mistake was committed allowed to be on record till Thandan community was included in the list of Scheduled Castes. As such taking a serious view of the entire problem we would hold that in all cases where certificates have been issued on and after 27-7-1977 the date of 1976 order correcting the name of Caste from Ezhava/Thiyya to Thandan and other cases where certificates have been issued changing the Caste into a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe such certificates issued are liable to be declared as of doubtful validly, till they are scrutinised by the scrutiny Committee to be constituted by the first respondent as per the directions we propose to issue in that regard...” (emphasis supplied)
6. Pursuant to the above directions of the High Court the caste certificate issued in favour of the respondent also came under scrutiny. In the course of scrutiny, it was found that the reports submitted by KIRTADS and relied upon by the High Court while allowing O.P. No.9216 of 1986 was erroneous and that the respondent actually belonged to Ezhuva community which fell under the OBC category. Director, KIRTADS accordingly issued notice to the respondent to appear before him for a personal hearing in support of the claim that he was a Thandan and hence a Scheduled Caste. Aggrieved by the said proceedings the respondent filed O.P. No.5834 of 1991 before the High Court of Kerala in which he challenged the proposed enquiry proceedings relating to his caste status primarily on the ground that the decision of this Court in Palaghat Jilla Thandan Samudhaya Samrakshna Samithi and Anr. v. State of Kerala and Anr. (1994) 1 SCC 359 had settled the controversy relating to Ezhuva/Thiyya being a ‘Thandan’ in the district of Palaghat. It was also contended that the respondent’s own case that he was a Thandan Scheduled Caste had been settled by the High Court in terms of the order passed by the High Court in O.P. No.9216 of 1986. These contentions found favour with the High Court who allowed O.P. No.5834 of 1991 filed by the respondent by its order dated 15th December, 1998 and quashed the ongoing enquiry proceedings.

7. Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court the State of Kerala filed Writ Appeal No.1300 of 1999 which was allowed by a Division Bench of the High Court by its judgment and order dated 14th June, 1999 and directed a fresh enquiry into the caste status of the respondent by KIRTADS. Review Petition No.236 of 1999 filed against the said order by the respondent was dismissed by the Division Bench by its order dated 29th July, 1999. The Division Bench, however, specifically reserved liberty for the respondent to bring the judgments pronounced in O.P. No.9216 of 1986 and O.P.No.5470 of 1988 to the notice of the Director, KIRTADS and declined to express any opinion of its own as to the effect of the said judgments. This is evident from the following passage from the order passed by the High Court:

“At the time of argument our attention was drawn to Ext. P7 judgment dated 25.2.87 in O.P. 9216/86 and also the judgment of a Division of this Court in O.P. 5470/88 for the proposition that this Court has already accepted the status of the petitioner in the above two cases. We are not inclined to express any opinion on the two judgment referred to above. It is for the review petitioner to place the above two judgments and other materials, if any before the Director for his consideration and report. The Director of Kirtads is directed to send his report to the State government within three months from the date of receipt of copy of the judgment and the Government may consider the entire matter on merits and pass appropriate orders accordingly, Review petition is disposed of as above.”
8. A fresh enquiry accordingly commenced in which Vigilance Officer, KIRTADS, reported that the genealogical and documentary evidence available on record proved beyond doubt that the respondent and all his consanguinal and affinal relatives belonged to the ‘Ezhuva’ and not ‘Thandan’ community. The Scrutiny Committee acting upon the said report issued a show-cause notice to the respondent to show cause as to why the certificate issued in his favour should not be cancelled.

9. Aggrieved by the notice issued to him the respondent once again approached the High Court in O.P. No.2912 of 2000 which was disposed of by the High Court by its order dated 4th July, 2001 with a direction that the KIRTADS report shall be placed before the State Government for appropriate orders. The State Government accordingly considered the matter and passed an order dated 18th January, 2003 by which it concurred with the report and the view taken by KIRTADS and declared as follow:

“(i) It is declared that Shri. V.K. Mahanudevan, S/o Shri Kunjukuttan, Kunnissery House, Kottaparambil, Vadakkancherry, Alathur, Palakkad District who is now working as Executive Engineer, Minor Irrigation Division, Irrigation Department, Palakkad does not belong to Thandan Community which is a Sch. Caste, but belongs to Ezhava Community included in the list of Other Backward Classes (OBC).
(ii) None of the members of his family shall be eligible for any of the benefits exclusively intended for members of the Sch. Castes. If any of the members of the family of Shri V.K. Mahanudevan have availed of any of the benefits meant for members of the Sch. Castes, all such benefits availed of shall be recovered.
(iii) If the caste entry in respect of the members of the family of Shri V.K. Mahanudevan as recorded in their academic records is Thandan (SC), it shall be corrected as Ezhava.
(iv) Sch. Caste Certificates shall not be issued to any of the members of the family of Shri V.K. Mahanudevan hereafter. All the Sch. Caste Certificates secured by Shri V.K. Mahanudevan and his family members will stand cancelled.
(v) On completion of the actions as per this order the services of Shri V.K. Mahanudevan, Executive Engineer, Minor Irrigation Division in the Irrigation Department shall be terminated forthwith and a member of Sch. Caste community shall be appointed against the post in which Shri V.K. Mahanudevan was appointed in the Irrigation Department if his appointment was on consideration as member of Sch. Caste.”
10. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Government, the respondent and his brother who is respondent in Civil Appeal No.3470 of 2007 challenged the order passed by the Government before the High Court in O.P. No.5596 of 2003 and Writ Petition (C) No.20434 of 2004 respectively which were allowed by a Single Judge of the High Court in terms of its order dated 11th November, 2005, primarily on the ground that the issue of caste certificate to the respondent had already been concluded by the judgment of the High Court dated 25th February, 1987 in O.P. No.9216 of 1986 and that the said question could not be re-opened so long as the said judgment of the High Court was effective.

11. The State of Kerala then preferred Writ Appeal No.134 of 2006 which was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court in terms of its order dated 25th January, 2006 concurring with the view taken by the Single Judge that the issue regarding the caste status of the respondent stood concluded by a judicial order passed inter parties and could not, therefore, be re- opened. Writ Appeal No.410 of 2006 filed by the aggrieved members of the Irrigation Department and Writ Appeal No.193 of 2006 filed by the State in relation to respondent were dismissed by the Division Bench on the same terms by order dated 28th and 27th January, 2006 respectively. So also Review Petition No.263 of 2006 filed by the State against the order passed by the Division Bench was dismissed with the observation that the judgment in O.P. No.9216 of 1986 had effectively settled the question regarding the caste status of the respondent. Civil Appeals No.3469 and 3470 of 2007 have been filed by the State against the said judgment of the High Court while Civil Appeal No.3468 of 2007 has been filed by the members of the Irrigation Department of the Government of Kerala. Civil Appeal arising out of Petition for special leave to appeal (Civil) No.24775 of 2013 has been filed by State against the Order dated 5th September, 2012.

12. Two distinct questions fall for determination in these appeals. The first is whether the appellants could have re-opened for examination the caste status of the respondent-V.K. Mahanudevan no matter judgment of the High Court in O.P No.9216 of 1986 had declared him to be a ‘Thandan’ belonging to a Scheduled Caste community. The High Court has as seen above taken the view that its judgment and Order in O.P.No.9216 of 1986 effectively settled the question regarding the caste status of respondent which could not be reopened as the said judgment had attained finality. The second and the only other question that would arise for determination is whether the respondent-V.K. Mahanudevan can claim protection against ouster from service and, if so, what is the effect of the change in law relevant to the caste status of the respondent. We propose to deal with the two questions ad seriatim.

13. In O.P No. 9216 of 1986, the respondent (writ petitioners in OP) had claimed to be a Thandan by Caste, hence, a Schedule Caste in terms of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976. In the SLCC book the respondent was described as a “Thandan Hindu” but falling in the OBC category. He applied for correction of the SLCC book by deleting his description as an OBC and for treating him as a member of the Scheduled Caste. Since the correction did not come about quickly, he moved to the High Court for a direction against the respondents to treat him as a Scheduled Caste and to make appropriate entries in the relevant record. Kerala Public Service Commission, Director, Harijan Welfare Board, Trivandrum were among others arrayed as respondents to the writ petition. When the matter appeared before a Single Bench of the High Court for hearing, it was reported that Director, Kerala Institute for Research Training and Development Studies of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Kozhikode (KIRTADS) had conducted an anthropological study and recorded a finding that the respondent–writ petitioner before the High Court belonged to Thandan Community and that he was entitled to be treated as a Scheduled Caste. Government advocate representing the respondents appears to have submitted before the Court that the findings recorded by the KIRTADS had been communicated to the Director of Harijan Welfare, Trivandrum–respondent no.3 in the writ petition and accepted by him. It was on these submissions made before the High Court that the Single Bench of the High Court passed an Order dated 25th February, 1987, the operative portion whereof read as under :-

“I record the submission of the Government Pleader that the 3rd respondent has accepted the findings of the 4th respondent that the petitioner is a Thandan and hence entitled to the benefits as a scheduled caste. The 6th respondent may implement this finding and issue certificate to the petition in the prescribed form certifying that the petitioner is a Thandan, a member of the scheduled caste. This shall be done within a period of ten days from today. Based thereon the 5th respondent will also make the necessary changes in the S.S.L.C. book of the petitioner treating him as a scheduled caste and not as an D.B.C. This also will be done by the 5th respondent within a period of one month from today.”
14. A caste certificate was in the above circumstances issued in favour of the respondent pursuant to the order passed by the High Court which order has attained finality for the same has not been challenged leave alone modified or set aside in any proceedings till date. The question in the above context is whether a fresh enquiry into the Caste Status of the respondent could be instituted by the Government. The enquiry, as seen earlier, was initiated in the light of the certain observations made by the full bench of the Kerala High Court in Kerala Pattika Jathi Samrekshana Samithy v. State AIR 1995 Ker 337 whereby the High Court had entertained suspicion about the validity of certificates that were corrected after 27th July, 1997. That pronouncement came nearly eight years after the High Court had disposed of O.P. No.9216 of 1986 and a resultant certificate issued in favour of the respondent. It was in the above backdrop rightly argued by Mr. Giri appearing for the respondent that the judgement and order passed by the High Court in O.P No.9216 of 1986 having attained finality no fresh or further enquiry into the question settled thereby could be initiated, the observations of the full bench of the High Court to the contrary notwithstanding. The judgement of the High Court in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra), it is obvious, from a reading thereof, does not deal with situations where the issue regarding grant of validity of a caste certificate secured earlier than the said judgment had been the subject matter of judicial proceedings and effectively and finally resolved in the same. That apart, the respondent was not a party to the proceedings before the full bench nor was the certificate issued in his favour under challenge in those proceedings. The full bench did not even incidentally have to examine the validity of the certificate issued to the respondent or the correctness of the order passed by the High Court pursuant to which it was issued. Such being the position the direction issued by the full bench of the High Court could not possibly have the effect of setting at naught a judgment delivered inter-parties which had attained finality and remained binding on all concerned.

15. It is trite that law favours finality to binding judicial decisions pronounced by Courts that are competent to deal with the subject matter. Public interest is against individuals being vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation. The binding character of judgments pronounced by the Courts of competent jurisdiction has always been treated as an essential part of the rule of law which is the basis of the administration of justice in this country. We may gainfully refer to the decision of Constitution Bench of this Court in the Daryao v. State of U.P. AIR 1961 SC 1457 where the Court succinctly summed up the law in the following words:

“It is in the interest of the public at large that a finality should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by Courts of competent jurisdiction, and it is also in the public interest that individuals should not be vexed twice over with the same kind of litigation.(***) The binding character of judgments pronounced by courts of competent jurisdiction is itself an essential part of the rule of law, and the rule of law obviously is the basis of the administration of justice on which the Constitution lays so much emphasis.”
16. That even erroneous decisions can operate as res-judicata is also fairly well settled by a long line of decisions rendered by this Court. In Mohanlal Goenka v. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee AIR 1953 SC 65, this Court observed:

“There is ample authority for the proposition that even an erroneous decision on a question of law operates as ‘res judicata’ between the parties to it. The correctness or otherwise of a judicial decision has no bearing upon the question whether or not it operates as ‘res judicata’.”
17. Similarly in State of West Bengal v. Hemant Kumar Bhattacharjee AIR 1966 SC 1061, this Court reiterated the above principles in the following words :

“A wrong decision by a court having jurisdiction is as much binding between the parties as a right one and may be superseded only by appeals to higher tribunals or other procedure like review which the law provides.”
18. The recent decision of this Court in Kalinga Mining Corporation v. Union of India (2013) 5 SCC 252 is a timely reminder of the very same principle. The following passage in this regard is apposite:

“In our opinion, if the parties are allowed to reagitate issues which have been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction on a subsequent change in the law then all earlier litigation relevant thereto would always remain in a state of flux. In such circumstances, every time either a statute or a provision thereof is declared ultra vires, it would have the result of reopening of the decided matters within the period of limitation following the date of such decision.”
19. In Mathura Prasad v. Dossibai (1970) 1 SCC 613, this Court held that for the application of the rule of res-judicata, the Court is not concerned with the correctness or otherwise of the earlier judgement. The matter in issue if one purely of fact decided in the earlier proceedings by a competent Court must in any subsequent litigation between the same parties be recorded as finally decided and cannot be re-opened. That is true even in regard to mixed questions of law and fact determined in the earlier proceeding between the same parties which cannot be revised or reopened in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties. Having said that we must add that the only exception to the doctrine of res-judicata is “fraud” that vitiates the decision and renders it a nullity. This Court has in more than one decision held that fraud renders any judgment, decree or orders a nullity and non-est in the eyes of law. In A.V. Papayya Sastry v. Government of A.P., (2007) 4 SCC 221, fraud was defined by this Court in the following words:

“Fraud may be defined as an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing some unfair or undeserved benefit by taking undue advantage of another. In fraud one gains at the loss and cost of another. Even most solemn proceedings stand vitiated if they are actuated by fraud. Fraud is thus an extrinsic collateral act which vitiates all judicial acts, whether in rem or in personam. The principle of “finality of litigation” cannot be stretched to the extent of an absurdity that it can be utilised as an engine of oppression by dishonest and fraudulent litigants.”
20. To the same effect is the decision in Raju Ramsingh Vasave v. Mahesh Deorao Bhivapurkar and Ors., (2008) 9 SCC 54, where this Court held:

“If a fraud has been committed on the court, no benefits therefrom can be claimed on the basis of thereof or otherwise.”

21. In the case at hand we see no element of fraud in the Order passed by the High Court in O.P.No.9216 of 1986. The order it is evident from a plain reading of the same relies more upon the submissions made before it by the Government Counsel than those urged on behalf of the writ- petitioners (respondents herein). That there was an enquiry by KIRTADS into the caste status of the writ petitioners (respondents herein) which found his claim of being a Thandan justified hence entitled to a scheduled caste certificate has not been disputed. That the report of KIRTADS was accepted by the Director of Harijan Welfare, Trivandrum is also not denied. That apart, the State Government at no stage either before or after the Order passed by the Single Judge of the High Court questioned the conclusions recorded therein till the full bench in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra) expressed doubts about the corrections being made in the records and certificates for the grant of scheduled caste status. That being the case, the High Court could not be said to have been misled or fraudulently misguided into passing an order, leave alone, misled by the writ- petitioners (respondent herein). It is only because the full bench of the Kerala High Court held that anthropological study conducted by KIRTADS may not provide a sound basis for holding Thandan’s like the respondent as those belonging to the scheduled caste category that the issue regarding the correctness of the certificate and a fresh investigation into the matter surfaced for consideration. Even if one were to assume that the conclusion drawn by KIRTADS was not for any reason completely accurate and reliable, the same would not have in the absence of any other material to show that such conclusion and enquiry was a complete farce based on wholly irrelevant or inadmissible material and motivated by extraneous considerations by itself provided a basis for unsettling what stood settled by the order passed by the High Court. Suffice it to say that the contention urged on behalf of the appellants that the order passed by the High Court in O.P. No. 9216 of 1986 was a nullity on the ground of fraud has not impressed us in the facts and circumstances of the case. The upshot of the above discussion, therefore, is that the order passed by the High Court in O.P.No.9216 of 1986 which had attained finality did not permit a fresh enquiry into the caste status of writ-petitioner. Inasmuch as the High Court quashed the said proceedings and the order passed by the State Government pursuant thereto, it committed no error to warrant interference.

22. That brings us to the second question which can be answered only in the perspective in which the same arises for consideration. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 specified the castes that are recognised as Scheduled Castes for different states in the Country. Part XVI related to the then State of Travancore and Cochin. Item 22 of that part specified the “Thandan” as a scheduled caste for the purposes of the entire State. The Presidential Order was modified by The Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes Lists (Modification) Order 1956. In the list comprising Part V applicable to the State of Kerala (the successor to the State of Trivandrum, Kochi), ‘Thandan’ as a caste appeared at Item 14 for the purposes of the entire State except Malabar District. Then came the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 27th July, 1997. In the first Schedule under part VII applicable to the State of Kerala ‘Thandan’ as a caste was shown at Item

61. Unlike two other castes shown in the said part namely Boyan and Malayan which were shown as scheduled caste for specific areas of the State of Kerala, Thandan had no such geographical or regional limitation. This implied that ‘Thandan’ was included as a Scheduled Caste for the entire State of Kerala.

23. Consequent upon the promulgation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976, the Kerala State Government started receiving complaints alleging that a section of Ezhuva/Thiyya community of Malabar areas and certain taluk of Malabar districts who were also called ‘Thandan’ were taking undeserved advantage of the Scheduled Caste reservations. The complaints suggested that these two categories of Thandan were quite different and distinct from each other and that the benefit admissible to Thandans generally belonging to the Scheduled Caste community should not be allowed to be taken by those belonging to the Ezhuva/Thiyya community as they are not scheduled castes. Acting upon these reports and complaints, the State Government appears to have issued instructions to the effect that applications for issue of community certificates to ‘Thandans’ of all the four districts of Malabar areas and Taluks of Thalapilly, Vadakkancherry and Chavakka in Trichur District, should be scrutinised to ascertain whether the applicant belongs to the Thandan community of the scheduled caste or the Thandan section of Ezhuva/Thiyya community and that while issuing community certificate to the ‘Thandans’ who were scheduled caste, the authorities should note the name of the community in the certificate as “Thandans other than Ezhuva/Thiyya”. These instructions were withdrawn to be followed by another order passed in the year 1987 by which the Government once again directed that while issuing caste certificate, the Revenue Authority should hold proper verification to find out whether the person concerned belongs to Thandan caste and not to Ezhuva/Thiyya. The matter eventually reached this Court in Palghat Jilla Thandan Samudhaya Samrakshna Samithi and Anr. v. State of Kerala and Anr. (1994) 1 SCC 359 in which this Court formulated the principal question that fell for consideration in the following words:

“The principal question that arises in these writ petitions and appeals is in regard to the validity of the decision of the State of Kerala not to treat members of the Thandan community belonging to the erstwhile Malabar District, including the present Palghat District, of the State of Kerala as members of the Scheduled Castes.”
24. This Court reviewed the legal position and declared that Thandan community having been listed in the Scheduled Caste order as it then stood, it was not open to the State Government or even to this court to embark upon an enquiry to determine whether a section of Ezhuva/Thiyya which was called Thandan in the Malabar area of the State was excluded from the benefits of the Scheduled Caste order. This Court observed:

“Article 341 empowers the President to specify not only castes, races or tribes which shall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to a State but also “parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes” which shall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to a State. By reason of Article 341 a part or group or section of a caste, race or tribe, which, as a whole, is not specified as a Scheduled Caste, may be specified as a Scheduled Caste. Assuming, therefore, that there is a section of the Ezhavas/Thiyyas community (which is not specified as a Scheduled Caste) which is called Thandan in some parts of Malabar area, that section is also entitled to be treated as a Scheduled Caste, for Thandans throughout the State are deemed to be a Scheduled Caste by reason of the provisions of the Scheduled Castes Order as it now stands. Once Thandans throughout the State are entitled to be treated as a Scheduled Caste by reason of the Scheduled Castes Order as it now stands, it is not open to the State Government to say otherwise, as it has purported to do in the 1987 order.” (emphasis supplied)
25. What followed from the above is that Thandans regardless whether they were Ezhuvas/Thiyyas known as Thandans belonging to the Malabar area, were by reason of the above pronouncement of this Court held entitled to the benefit of being treated as scheduled caste by the Presidential Order, any enquiry into their being Thandans who were scheduled caste having been forbidden by this Court as legally impermissible. The distinction which the State Government sought to make between Ezhuva/Thiyyas known as Thandans like the respondent on one hand and Thandans who fell in the scheduled caste category, on the other, thus stood abolished by reason of the above pronouncement. No such argument could be countenanced against the respondent especially when it is not the case of the appellants that the respondent is not an Ezhuva from Malabar area of the State of Kerala.

26. The legal position has since the pronouncement of this Court in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra) undergone a change on account of the amendment of the Presidential Order in terms of The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order Amendment Act, 2007 which received the assent of the President on 29th August, 2007 and was published in the official gazette on 30th August, 2007. The Act, inter alia, made the following change in Part VIII – Kerala for entry 61:– “61. Thandan (excluding Ezhuvas and Thiyyas who are known as Thandan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Malabar areas) and (Carpenters who are known as Thachan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Travancore State)”.

27. There is in the light of the above no manner of doubt that Ezhuvas and Thiyyas who are also known as Thandan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Malabar areas are no longer scheduled caste for the said State w.e.f. 30th August, 2007 the date when the amendment was notified. The Parliament has, it is evident, removed the prevailing confusion regarding Ezhuvas and Thiyyas known as Thandan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Malabar areas being treated as scheduled caste. Ezhuvas and Thiyyas even if called Thandans and belonging to the above area will no longer be entitled to be treated as scheduled caste nor will the benefits of reservation be admissible to them.

28. Taking note of the amending legislation, Government of Kerala has by Order No.93/2010/SC/ST dated 30th August, 2010 directed that Ezhuvas and Thiyyas who are known as Thandan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Malabar shall be treated as OBCs in List III. This part was not disputed even by Mr. Giri, counsel appearing for the respondent who fairly conceded that consequent upon the Amendment Act of 2007 (supra) Ezhuvas and Thiyyas known as Thandan, in the erstwhile Cochin and Malabar areas stand deleted from the Scheduled Castes List and are now treated as OBCs by the State Government. What is significant is that the deletion is clearly prospective in nature for Ezhuvas and Thiyyas known as Thandan in the above region were in the light of the decision of this Court in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra) entitled to be treated as scheduled caste and the distinction sought to be made between ‘Thandans’ who were Ezhuvas and Thiyyas and those who were scheduled caste was held to be impermissible and non est in the eye of law. The law declared by this Court in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra) entitled all Thandans including those who were Ezhuvas and Thiyyas from Cochin and Malabar region to claim the scheduled caste status. That entitlement could be taken away retrospectively only by specific provisions to that effect or by necessary intendment. We see no such specific provision or intendment in the amending legislation to hold that the entitlement was taken away retrospectively so as to affect even those who had already benefited from the reservation for scheduled caste candidates. At any rate, a certificate issued to an Ezhuvas known as Thandan who was a native of Cochin and Malabar region of the State could not be withdrawn as The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 did not make a distinction between the two categories of Thandans till the Amendment Act of 2007 for the first time introduced such a difference.

29. That apart the question of ouster of Ezhuvas and Thiyyas known as Thandan on account of the confusion that prevailed for a considerable length of time till the decision of this Court in Pattika Jathi’s case (supra) would be unjustified both in law and on the principles of equity and good conscience. In State of Maharashtra v. Milind (2001) 1 SCC 4, this Court was dealing with a somewhat similar situation. That was a case where a student had secured admission to the MBBS degree course by claiming himself to be a Scheduled Tribe candidate. The student claimed that Halba- Koshti were the same as Halba, mentioned in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order. This Court held that neither the Government nor the Court could add to the List of castes mentioned in the Order and that Halba- Koshtis could not by any process of reasoning or interpretation treated to be Halbas. Having said that, the question that fell for consideration was whether the benefit of the reservation could be withdrawn and the candidate deprived of the labour that he had put in obtaining a medical degree. This Court while protecting any such loss of qualification acquired by him observed:

“In these circumstances, this judgment shall not affect the degree obtained by him and his practising as a doctor. But we make it clear that he cannot claim to belong to the Scheduled Tribe covered by the Scheduled Tribes Order. In other words, he cannot take advantage of the Scheduled Tribes Order any further or for any other constitutional purpose. (***) we make it clear that the admissions and appointments that have become final, shall remain unaffected by this judgment”.
30. Kavita Solunke v. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 8 SCC 430, was also a similar case where the question was whether the appellant who was a ‘Halba- Koshti’ could be treated as ‘Halba’ for purposes of reservation and employment as a Scheduled Tribe candidate. This Court traced the history of the long drawn confusion whether a ‘Halba’ was the same as ‘Halba-Koshti’ and concluded that while ‘Halba’ and ‘Halba-Koshti’ could not be treated to be one and the same, the principle stated in Milind’s case (supra) was attracted to protect even appointments that were granted by treating ‘Halba- Koshti’ as Halba Scheduled Tribe although such extension of the expression ‘Halba’ appearing in the Presidential Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 was not permissible. This Court observed:

“If “Halba-Koshti” has been treated as “Halba” even before the appellant joined service as a teacher and if the only reason for her ouster is the law declared by this Court in Milind case, there is no reason why the protection against the ouster given by this Court to appointees whose applications had become final should not be extended to the appellant also. The Constitution Bench had in Milind case noticed the background in which the confusion had prevailed for many years and the fact that appointments and admissions were made for a long time treating “Koshti” as a Scheduled Tribe and directed that such admissions and appointments wherever the same had attained finality will not be affected by the decision taken by this Court”.
31. In Sandeep Subhash Parate v. State of Maharashtra and Others, (2006) 7 SCC 501, also dealing with a similar confusion between ‘Halba’ and ‘Halba- Koshti’ and applying the principle underlying in Milind’s case (supra) this Court held that ouster of candidates who have obtained undeserved benefit will be justified only where the Court finds the claim to be bona fide. In State of Maharashtra v. Sanjay K. Nimje, (2007) 14 SCC 481 this Court held that the grant of relief would depend upon the bona fides of the person who has obtained the appointment and upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

32. In the instant case there is no evidence of lack of bona fide by the respondent. The protection available under the decision of Milind’s case (supra) could, therefore, be admissible even to the respondent. It follows that even if on a true and correct construction of the expression ‘Thandan’ appearing in The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 2007 did not include ‘Ezhuvas’ and ‘Thiyyas’ known as ‘Thandan’ and assuming that the two were different at all relevant points of time, the fact that the position was not clear till the Amendment Act of 2007 made a clear distinction between the two would entitle all those appointed to serve the State upto the date of the Amending Act came into force to continue in service.

33. In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.24775 of 2013 filed against an order dated 5th September, 2012 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala, the High Court has found the cancellation of the Caste Certificate issued in favour of the respondent in that appeal to be legally bad inasmuch as the Scrutiny Committee had not applied its mind to the material which was relied upon by the respondent in that case. No enquiry into the validity of the certificate was found to have been conducted nor was the order passed by the Scrutiny Committee supported by reasons. There is, in our opinion, no legal flaw in that reasoning muchless any perversity that may call for our interference. The order passed by the High Court takes a fair view of the matter and does not suffer from any illegality or irregularity of any kind.",0
Union of India and others,"The Vasavi Co-op. Housing Society Ltd., the first respondent herein instituted a suit No.794 of 1988 before the City Civil Court, Hyderabad, seeking a declaration of title over land comprising 6 acres 30 guntas in Survey No.60/1 and 61 of Kakaguda village and recovery of the vacant possession from Defendant Nos.1 to 3 and 7, the appellants herein, after removal of the structure made therein by them. The plaintiff has also sought for an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the above-mentioned land and also for other consequential refliefs. The City Civil Court vide its judgment dated 31.07.1996 decreed the suit, as prayed for, against which the appellants preferred C.C.C.A. No.123 of 1996 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. The High Court also affirmed the judgment of the trial Court on 6.9.2002, but noticed that the appellant had made large scale construction of quarters for the Defence Accounts Department, therefore, it would be in the interest of justice that an opportunity be given to the appellants to provide alternative suitable extent of land in lieu of the scheduled suit land, for which eight months’ time was granted from the date of the judgment. Aggrieved by the same, the Union of India and others have filed the present appeal. FACTS

2. The plaintiff’s case is that it had purchased the land situated in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62 of Kakaguda Village from Pattedar B.M. Rama Reddy and his sons and others during the year 1981-82. The suit land in question forms part of Survey Nos.60 and 61. The suit land in question belonged to the family of B. Venkata Narasimha Reddy consisting of himself and his sons Anna Reddy, B.V. Pulla Reddy and B.M. Rama Reddy and Anna Reddy’s son Prakash Reddy. Land in old Survey No.53 was allotted to Rama Reddy vide registered family settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939 (Ex.A2). In the subsequent re-settlement of village (Setwar of 1353 FASLI), the land in Survey No.53 was re-numbered as Survey No.60, 61 and 62. Ever since the allotment in the family partition of the above-mentioned land, vide the family partition deed dated 19.03.1939, Rama Reddy had been in exclusive possession and enjoyment and was paying land revenue. Rama Reddy’s name was also mutated in the Pahanies.

3. Plaintiffs further stated that the first defendant had it’s A.O.C. Centre building complex in Tirumalagiri village adjoining the suit land Survey No.60 of Kakaguda village. The first defendant had also requisitioned 4 acres and 28 guntas in Survey No.60 of Kakaguda Village in the year 1971 along with the adjoining land in Tirumalagiri for extension of A.O.C. Centre. Further, it was stated that 6th Defendant took possession of the above-mentioned land and delivered possession of the same to other defendants. The 3rd Defendant later vide his letter dated 18.12.1979 sent a requisition for acquisition of 4.38 guntas in Surevy No.60 for the extension of A.O.C. Centre. Notification was published in the official Gazette dated 18.09.1980 and a declaration was made on 30.06.1981 and compensation was awarded to Rama Reddy vide Award dated 26.07.1982.

4. The Plaintiffs, as already stated, had entered into various sale deeds with Rama Reddy during the year 1981-82 by which land measuring 13 acres and 08 guntas in Survey No.60, 11 acres and 04 guntas in Survey No.61 and 17 acres and 20 guntas in Survey No.62 were purchased, that is in all 41 acres and 32 guntas. Plaintiffs further stated that the land, which was purchased by it was vacant, but persons of the Defence Department started making some marking on the portions of the land purchased by the plaintiff, stating that a substantial portion of the land purchased by the plaintiff in Survey No.60/1 and 61 belonged to the Defence Department and treated as B-4 in their records. Plaintiff then preferred an application dated 12.09.1983 to the District Collector under the A.P. Survey and Boundaries Act for demarcation of boundaries. Following that, Deputy Director of Survey issued a notice dated 21.01.1984 calling upon the plaintiff and 3rd Defendant to attend to the demarcation on 25.01.1984. Later, a joint survey was conducted. The 3rd Defendant stated that land to the extent of 4 acres and 35 guntas in Survey No.60 and 61 corresponds to their G.L.R. (General Land Register) No.445 and it is their land as per the record. The Deputy Director of Survey, however, stated that lands in Survey Nos.60 and 61 of Kakaguda village are patta lands as per the settlement records and vacant, abutting Tirumalagiri village boundaries to Military Pillers and not partly covered in Survey No.60. Plaintiff later filed an application for issuing of a certificate as per the plan prepared by the Revenue Records under Section 19(v) of the Urban Land Ceiling Act. Plaintiff further stated that pending that application, officers of Garrison Engineers, on the direction of the 3rd Defendant, illegally occupied land measuring 2 acres and 29 guntas in Survey No.60 and 4 acres and 01 guntas in Survey No.61. Thus, a total extent of land 6 acres and 30 guntas was encroached upon and construction was effected despite the protest by the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff preferred the present suit, the details of which have already been stated earlier.

5. The 3rd Defendant filed a written statement stating that an area of land measuring 7 acres and 51 guntas, out of Survey No.1, 60 and 61 of Kakaguda village comprising G.L.R. Survey No.445 of Cantonment belongs to the first Defendant, which is locally managed and possessed by Defendant No.3 being local representative of Defendant No.1 and D-3 and is also the custodian of all defence records. Further, it was also stated that, as per the G.L.R., the said land was classified as B-4 and placed under the management of Defence Estates Officer. It was also stated that the suit land is part of review Survey Nos.60 and 61 and the plaintiff is wrongly claiming that the said land was purchased by it. Further, it was also stated that the plaintiff is threatening to encroach upon another 6 guntas of land alleged to be situated in Survey Nos.60/1 and 61. It has been categorically stated that, as per the records maintained by the 3rd Defendant, land measuring 7 acres and 51 guntas, forming part of G.L.R. Survey No.445 of the Cantonment is part of Survey Nos.1, 60 and 61 of Kakaguda village. It is owned, possessed and enjoyed by Defendant Nos.1 to 4 and 7.

6. The plaintiff, in order to establish its claim, examined PWs 1 to 4 and produced Exs. A-1 to A-85 and Exs. X-1 to X-10 besides Exs. A-86 to A- 89 on behalf of DW1. On behalf of the defendants DW1 was examined and Exs D-1 to D-7 are produced.

7. The primary issue which came up for consideration before the trial court was whether the plaintiff has got ownership and possession over 6 acres and 30 guntas covered by Survey No.60/1 and 61 of Kakaguda village for which considerable reliance was placed on the settlement record (Setwar Ex.A-3 of 1353 Fasli). On the other hand, the defendants placed considerable reliance on G.L.R. Survey No.445 of the Cantonment which is part of Survey No.1, 60 and 61 of Kakaguda village, wherein, according to the defendants, the suit land falls. PW2, the Deputy Inspector of Survey stated, according to Setwar, land in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62 is patta land of Prakash Reddy and others and such Survey numbers corresponds to Old Survey No.53. The evidence of PW-3 and 4 also states that the land is covered by old Survey No.53 which figures in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62. Ext. A-3 Setwar, is a settlement register prepared by the Survey Officer at the time of revised survey and settlement in the year 1358 Fasli in which the names of the predecessors in title of the plaintiff are shown as pattedars. In other words, Ex-A-3 is the exhibit of rights and title of plaintiff’s predecessors in title.

8. Defedants, as already indicated, on the other hand, pleaded that the total extent of Survey No.53 was only 33 acres and 12 guntas and if that be so, after sub-division the extent of sub-divided survey numbers would also remain the same, but the extent of sub-divided Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62 were increased to 41 acres and 32 guntas in the revenue records without any notice to the defendants which according to the defendants, was fraudulently done by one Venkata Narasimha Reddy, the original land owner of Survey No.53 of Kakaguda village, who himself was the Patwari of Kakaguda village. Further, it was the stand of the Defendants that in exercise of powers under The Secunderabad and Aurangabad Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1930, the G.LR. of 1933 was prepared by Captain O.M. James after making detailed enquiries from the holder of occupancy rights as well as general public. Further, it is also stated that certain land within the villages were handed over by the then Nizam to British Government for military use. Land in question measuring 7 acres and 51 guntas in G.L.R. 1933 at Survey No.581 was used by the British Government as murram pits and it was classified as Class-C land vested in the Cantonment Authority. G.L.R. 1933 was re-written in the year 1956 in view of the provisions of Rule 3 of Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937 and said Survey No.581 was re-written as G.L.R. Survey No.445. Further, in view of the classification of the land, as stipulated in Cantonment Land Administration rules, 1937, land pertaining to G.L.R. Survey No.445 was re- classified as B-4 (vacant land) reserved for future military purposes and management was transferred from cantonment authority to Defence Estate.

9. The above-mentioned facts would indicate that the plaintiff traces their title to the various sale deeds, Ext.A-3 Setwar of 1353 Fasli and the oral evidence of the survey officials and the defendants claim title and possession of the land on the basis of the G.L.R. The question that falls for consideration is whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff is sufficient to establish the title to the land in question and to give a declaration of title and possession by the civil court.

10. Shri Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that G.L.R. 445 measuring an area of 7 acres and 51 guntas is classified as B-4 and placed under the management of the Defence Estate Officer. Column 7 of the G.L.R. would indicate that the landlord is the Central Government. Out of 7 acres and 51 guntas, land admeasuring 6 acres has been handed over to Defence Accounts Department for construction of Defence Staff Quarters as per survey No.445/A, as per the records as early as in 1984. Further, it was pointed out that the appellant had already constructed approximately 300 quarters in 6 acres of land. Learned senior counsel submitted that since the extent of land mentioned in old Survey No.53 as well as in the settlement and partition deed, do not tally to the extent of land mentioned in Ext.A-3 and burden is heavy on the side of the plaintiff to show and explain as to how the registered family settlement and partition deed did not take place in the disputed land. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the High Court has committed an error in ignoring the G.L.R. produced by the defendants, even though there is no burden on the defendants to establish its title in a suit filed by the plaintiff for declaration of title and possession.

11. Shri P.S. Narasimha, learned senior counsel and Shri Basava Prabhu Patil, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that the city civil court as well as the High Court have correctly appreciated and understood the legal position and correctly discarded the entries made in the G.L.R. Learned senior counsel submitted that the correctness and evidentiary value of G.L.R. entries have to be appreciated in the context of the history of the Secunderabad Cantonment. Reference was made to the provisions of Cantonment Act, 1924 and it was pointed out that the Secunderabad and Aurangabad Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1930 do not apply to the Kakaguda village. Learned senior counsel have also referred to Ex.A6, the Sesala Pahani for the year 1955-58, of Kakaguda village, Ex.A7, the Pahani Patrika for the year 1971-72, Ex.A8, the Pahani Patrika for the year 1972-73 and submitted that they would indicate that Methurama Reddy, the predecessor in title, was the Pattedar of Survey Nos.60 and 61 of Kakaguda village. It was pointed out that the entries made therein have evidentiary value. Learned counsel pointed out that the Settlement Register prepared under the Statutes and Pahanies maintained under the Hyderabad Record of Rights in Land Regulations of 1358, Fasli have considerable evidentiary value. Further, it was also pointed out that the land in question is pot kharab land, which is not normally treated as land in Section 3(j) of Ceiling Act and hance may not figure in a Settlement or Partition Deed, hence not subjected to any revenue assessment. Learned senior counsel submitted that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing its title to the property in question, as was found by the city civil court as well as the High Court which calls for no interference by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.

12. It is trite law that, in a suit for declaration of title, burden always lies on the plaintiff to make out and establish a clear case for granting such a declaration and the weakness, if any, of the case set up by the defendants would not be a ground to grant relief to the plaintiff.

13. The High Court, we notice, has taken the view that once the evidence is let in by both the parties, the question of burden of proof pales into insignificance and the evidence let in by both the parties is required to be appreciated by the court in order to record its findings in respect of each of the issues that may ultimately determine the fate of the suit. The High Court has also proceeded on the basis that initial burden would always be upon the plaintiff to establish its case but if the evidence let in by defendants in support of their case probabalises the case set up by the plaintiff, such evidence cannot be ignored and kept out of consideration.

14. At the outset, let us examine the legal position with regard to whom the burden of proof lies in a suit for declaration of title and possession. This Court in Maran Mar Basselios Catholicos v. Thukalan Paulo Avira reported in AIR1959 SC 31 observed that “in a suit for declaration if the plaintiffs are to succeed, they must do so on the strength of their own title.” In Nagar Palika, Jind v. Jagat Singh, Advocate (1995) 3 SCC 426, this Court held as under:

“the onus to prove title to the property in question was on the plaintiff. In a suit for ejectment based on title it was incumbent on the part of the court of appeal first to record a finding on the claim of title to the suit land made on behalf of the plaintiff. The court is bound to enquire or investigate that question first before going into any other question that may arise in a suit.”
15. The legal position, therefore, is clear that the plaintiff in a suit for declaration of title and possession could succeed only on the strength of its own title and that could be done only by adducing sufficient evidence to discharge the onus on it, irrespective of the question whether the defendants have proved their case or not. We are of the view that even if the title set up by the defendants is found against, in the absence of establishment of plaintiff’s own title, plaintiff must be non-suited.

16. We notice that the trial court as well as the High Court rather than examining that question in depth, as to whether the plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing their title on the scheduled suit land, went on to examine in depth the weakness of the defendants title. Defendants relied on the entries in the GLR and their possession or re-possession over the suit land to non-suit the Plaintiffs. The court went on to examine the correctness and evidentiary value of the entries in the GLR in the context of the history and scope of Cantonment Act, 1924, the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1925 and tried to establish that no reliance could be placed on the GLR. The question is not whether the GLR could be accepted or not, the question is, whether the plaintiff could prove its title over the suit property in question. The entries in the GLR by themselves may not constitute title, but the question is whether entries made in Ext.A-3 would confer title or not on the Plaintiff.

17. This Court in several Judgments has held that the revenue records does not confer title. In Corporation of the City of Bangalore v. M. Papaiah and another (1989) 3 SCC 612 held that “it is firmly established that revenue records are not documents of title, and the question of interpretation of document not being a document of title is not a question of law.” In Guru Amarjit Singh v. Rattan Chand and others (1993) 4 SCC 349 this Court has held that “that the entries in jamabandi are not proof of title”. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Keshav Ram and others (1996) 11 SCC 257 this Court held that “the entries in the revenue papers, by no stretch of imagination can form the basis for declaration of title in favour of the plaintiff.”

18. The Plaintiff has also maintained the stand that their predecessor-in- interest was the Pattadar of the suit land. In a given case, the conferment of Patta as such does not confer title. Reference may be made to the judgment of this Court in Syndicate Bank v. Estate Officer & Manager, APIIC Ltd. & Ors. (2007) 8 SCC 361 and Vatticherukuru Village Panchayat v. Nori Venkatarama Deekshithulu & Ors. (1991) Supp. (2) SCC 228.

19. We notice that the above principle laid down by this Court sought to be distinguished by the High Court on the ground that none of the above- mentioned judgments, there is any reference to any statutory provisions under which revenue records referred therein, namely, revenue register, settlement register, jamabandi registers are maintained. The High Court took the view that Ext.A-3 has evidentiary value since the same has been prepared on the basis of Hyderabad record of Rights in Land Regulation, 1358 Fasli. It was also noticed that column 1 to 19 of Pahani Patrika is nothing but record of rights and the entries in column 1 to 19 in Pahani Patrika shall be deemed to be entries made and maintained under Regulations.

20. We are of the view that even if the entries in the Record of Rights carry evidentiary value, that itself would not confer any title on the plaintiff on the suit land in question. Ext.X-1 is Classer Register of 1347 which according to the trial court, speaks of the ownership of the plaintiff’s vendor’s property. We are of the view that these entries, as such, would not confer any title. Plaintiffs have to show, independent of those entries, that the plaintiff’s predecessors had title over the property in question and it is that property which they have purchased. The only document that has been produced before the court was the registered family settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939 of their predecessor in interest, wherein, admittedly, the suit land in question has not been mentioned.

21. Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that the land in question is pot kharab and since no tax is being paid, the same would not normally be mentioned in the partition deed or settlement deed. The A.P. Survey and Settlement Mannual, Chapter XIII deals with pot kharab land, which is generally a non-cultivable land and if the predecessors in interest had ownership over this pot kharab land, the suit land, we fail to see, why there is no reference at all to the family settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939. Admittedly, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff got this property in question through the above-mentioned family settlement and partition deed. Conspicuous absence of the suit land in question in the above-mentioned deed would cast doubt about the ownership and title of the plaintiffs over the suit land in question. No acceptable explanation has been given by the plaintiff to explain away the conspicuous omission of the suit land in the registered family settlement and partition deed. Facts would also clearly indicate that in Ext-A1, the suit land has been described in old Survey No.53 which was allotted to the plaintiff’s predecessors in title. It is the common case of the parties that Survey No.53 was sub-divided into Survey Nos.60, 61 and 63. Admittedly, the old Survey No.53 takes in only 33 acres and 12 guntas, then naturally, Survey Nos.60, 61 and 63 cannot be more than that extent. Further, if pot kharab land is not recorded in the revenue record, it would be so even in case of sub-division of Old Survey No. 53. The only explanation was that, since the suit land being pot kharab land, it might not have been mentioned in Ex.A.

22. A family settlement is based generally on the assumption that there was an antecedent title of some kind in the purchase and the arrangement acknowledges and defines what that title was. In a family settlement-cum- partition, the parties may define the shares in the joint property and may either choose to divide the property by metes and bounds or may continue to live together and enjoy the property as common. So far as this case is concerned, Ex.A1 is totally silent as to whose share the suit land will fall and who will enjoy it. Needless to say that the burden is on the plaintiff to explain away those factors, but the plaintiff has not succeeded. On other hand, much emphasis has been placed on the failure on the part of the defendants to show that the applicability of the GLR. The defendant maintained the stand that the entries made in GLR, maintained under the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937, in the regular course of administration of the cantonment lands, are admissible in evidence and the entries made therein will prevail over the records maintained under the various enactment, like the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Land Revenue Act, 1317 Falsi, the Hyderabad Record of Rights in Land Regulation, 1358 Falsi, the Hyderabad Record of Rights Rules, 1956 etc. In order to establish that position, reliance was placed on the judgments of this Court in Union of India v. Ibrahim Uddin & Anr. (2012) 8 SCC 148, Union of India & Ors. v. Kamla Verma (2010) 13 SCC 511, Chief Executive Officer v. Surendra Kumar Vakil & Ors. (1999) 3 SCC 555 and Secunderabad Cantonment Board, Andhra Circle, Secundrabad v. Mohd. Mohiuddin & Ors. (2003) 12 SCC

315. Both, the trial Court and the High Court made a detailed exercise to find out whether the GLR Register maintained under the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937 and the entries made there under will have more evidentiary value than the Revenue records made by the Survey Department of the State Government. In our view, such an exercise was totally unnecessary. Rather than finding out the weakness of GLR, the Courts ought to have examined the soundness of the plaintiff case. We reiterate that the plaintiff has to succeed only on the strength of his case and not on the weakness of the case set up by the defendants in a suit for declaration of title and possession.",1
NANDLAL WASUDEO BADWAIK,"Petitioner happens to be the husband of respondent no. 1, Lata Nandlal Badwaik and alleged to be the father of girl child Netra alias Neha Nandlal Badwaik, respondent no. 2, herein. The marriage between them was solemnized on 30th of June, 1990 at Chandrapur. Wife filed an application for maintenance under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the same was dismissed by the learned Magistrate by order dated 10th December, 1993. Thereafter, the wife resorted to a fresh proceeding under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Code’) claiming maintenance for herself and her daughter, inter alia, alleging that she started living with her husband from 20th of June, 1996 and stayed with him for about two years and during that period got pregnant. She was sent for delivery at her parents’ place where she gave birth to a girl child, the respondent no. 2 herein. Petitioner-husband resisted the claim and alleged that the assertion of the wife that she stayed with him since 20th of June, 1996 is false. He denied that respondent no. 2 is his daughter. After 1991, according to the husband, he had no physical relationship with his wife. The learned Magistrate accepted the plea of the wife and granted maintenance at the rate of Rs.900/- per month to the wife and at the rate of Rs.500/- per month to the daughter. The challenge to the said order in revision has failed so also a petition under Section 482 of the Code, challenging those orders.

It is against these orders, the petitioner has preferred this special leave petition.

Leave granted.

Taking note of the challenge to the paternity of the child, this Court by order dated 10th of January, 2011 passed the following order:

“…………However, the petitioner-husband had challenged the paternity of the child and had claimed that no maintenance ought to have been awarded to the child. The petitioner had also applied for referring the child for DNA test, which was refused. It is against the said order of refusal that the present Special Leave was filed and the same prayer for conducting the DNA test was made before us. On 8th November, 2010 we had accordingly, directed the petitioner-husband to deposit all dues, both arrear and current, in respect of the maintenance awarded to the wife and child to enable us to consider the prayer for holding of such DNA test. Such deposit having been made on 3rd January, 2011, we had agreed to allow the petitioner’s prayer for conducting DNA test for ascertaining the paternity of the child.
We have since been informed by counsel for the parties that a Forensic Science Laboratory in Nagpur conducts the very same test, as has been asked for, by the Petitioner. Accordingly, we direct the petitioner-Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik and the respondent No. 1-Ms. Lata Nandlal Badwaik to make a joint application to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Nagpur, situated at Jail Road, Dhantoli, for conducting such test. The petitioner, as well as the respondent No. 1, shall present themselves at the Laboratory with respondent No. 2 for the said purpose on the date to be fixed by the laboratory, and, thereafter, the laboratory is directed to send the result of such test to this Court within four weeks thereafter. The expenses for the test to be conducted shall be borne by the petitioner-husband.” In the light of the aforesaid order, the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Nagpur has submitted the result of DNA testing and opined that appellant “Nandlal Vasudev Badwaik is excluded to be the biological father of Netra alias Neha Nandlal Badwaik”, respondent no. 2 herein.

Respondents, not being satisfied with the aforesaid report, made a request for re-test. The said prayer of the respondents was accepted and this Court by order dated 22nd of July, 2011 gave the following direction:

“Despite the fact that the report of the DNA Test conducted at the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, State of Maharashtra, Nagpur-12, indicates that the petitioner is not the biological father of the respondent No. 2, on the prayer made on behalf of the respondents for a re-test, we are of the view that such a prayer may be allowed having regard to the serious consequences of the Report which has been filed.
Accordingly, we direct that a further DNA Test be conducted at the Central Forensic Laboratory, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India at Hyderabad and for the said purpose the parties are directed to appear before the Laboratory on 24th August, 2011 at 11.00 a.m.” As directed, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad submitted its report and on that basis opined that the appellant, “Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik can be excluded from being the biological father of Miss Neha Nandlal Badwaik”, respondent no. 2 herein.

At the outset, Mr. Manish Pitale appearing for the respondents submits that the appellant having failed to establish that he had no access to his wife at any time when she could have begotten respondent no. 2, the direction for DNA test ought not to have been given. In view of the aforesaid he submits that the result of such a test is fit to be ignored. In support of the submission he has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B., (1993) 3 SCC 418, relevant portions whereof read as under:

“24. This section requires the party disputing the paternity to prove non-access in order to dispel the presumption. “Access” and “non-access” mean the existence or non-existence of opportunities for sexual intercourse; it does not mean actual “cohabitation”.
26. From the above discussion it emerges— (1) That courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course;
(2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot be entertained.
(3) there must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the presumption arising under Section 112 of the Evidence Act.
(4) the court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste woman.
(5) no one can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis.
27. Examined in the light of the above, we find no difficulty in upholding the impugned order of the High Court, confirming the order of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore in rejecting the application for blood test…………….” Yet another decision on which reliance has been placed is the decision of this Court in the case of Banarsi Dass v. Teeku Dutta, (2005) 4 SCC 449, paragraph 13, which is relevant for the purpose is quoted below:

“13. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in contemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Evidence Act e.g. if a husband and wife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard from the point of view of the husband who would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent. But even in such a case the law leans in favour of the innocent child from being bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living together during the time of conception. Hence the question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the light of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated above. (See Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram, 2001 (5) SCC 311.)” Reliance has also been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa State Commission for Women, (2010) 8 SCC 633, in which it has been held as follows:
“22. In our view, when there is apparent conflict between the right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the court to reach the truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the interests of the parties and on due consideration whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The court has to consider diverse aspects including presumption under Section 112 of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test of “eminent need” whether it is not possible for the court to reach the truth without use of such test.” Miss Anagha S. Desai appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that this Court twice ordered for DNA test and, hence, the question as to whether this was a fit case in which DNA profiling should or should not have been ordered is academic. We find substance in the submission of Ms. Desai. Fact of the matter is that this Court not only once, but twice gave directions for DNA test. The respondents, in fact, had not opposed the prayer of DNA test when such a prayer was being considered. It is only after the reports of the DNA test had been received, which was adverse to the respondents, that they are challenging it on the ground that such a test ought not to have been directed. We cannot go into the validity of the orders passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court at this stage. It has attained finality. Hence, we do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents. As regards the decision of this Court in the cases of Goutam Kundu (supra), Banarsi Dass (supra) and Bhabani Prasad Jena (supra), the same have no bearing in the facts and circumstances of the case. In all these cases, the court was considering as to whether facts of those cases justify passing of an order for DNA test. When the order for DNA test has already been passed, at this stage, we are not concerned with this issue and we have to proceed on an assumption that a valid direction for DNA test was given.
Ms. Desai submits that in view of the opinions, based on DNA profiling that appellant is not the biological father, he cannot be fastened with the liability to pay maintenance to the girl-child born to the wife. Mr. Pitale, however, submits that the marriage between the parties has not been dissolved, and the birth of the child having taken place during the subsistence of a valid marriage and the husband having access to the wife, conclusively prove that the girl-child is the legitimate daughter of the appellant. According to him, the DNA test cannot rebut the conclusive presumption envisaged under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. According to him, respondent no. 2, therefore, has to be held to be the appellant’s legitimate daughter. In support of the submission, reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram, (2001) 5 SCC 311, and reference has been made to paragraph 10 of the judgment, which reads as follows:
“10. ………The result of a genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Act e.g. if a husband and wife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard from the point of view of the husband who would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent. But even in such a case the law leans in favour of the innocent child from being bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living together during the time of conception……….” Before we proceed to consider the rival submissions, we deem it necessary to understand what exactly DNA test is and ultimately its accuracy. All living beings are composed of cells which are the smallest and basic unit of life. An average human body has trillion of cells of different sizes. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which is found in the chromosomes of the cells of living beings, is the blueprint of an individual. Human cells contain 46 chromosomes and those 46 chromosomes contain a total of six billion base pair in 46 duplex threads of DNA. DNA consists of four nitrogenous bases – adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine and phosphoric acid arranged in a regular structure. When two unrelated people possessing the same DNA pattern have been compared, the chances of complete similarity are 1 in 30 billion to 300 billion. Given that the Earth’s population is about 5 billion, this test shall have accurate result. It has been recognized by this Court in the case of Kamti Devi (supra) that the result of a genuine DNA test is scientifically accurate.
It is nobody’s case that the result of the DNA test is not genuine and, therefore, we have to proceed on an assumption that the result of the DNA test is accurate. The DNA test reports show that the appellant is not the biological father of the girl-child.
Now we have to consider as to whether the DNA test would be sufficient to hold that the appellant is not the biological father of respondent no. 2, in the face of what has been provided under Section 112 of the Evidence Act, which reads as follows:

“112. Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of legitimacy.-
The fact that any person was born during the continuance of a valid marriage between his mother and any man, or within two hundred and eighty days after its dissolution, the mother remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the legitimate son of that man, unless it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any time when he could have been begotten.” From a plain reading of the aforesaid, it is evident that a child born during the continuance of a valid marriage shall be a conclusive proof that the child is a legitimate child of the man to whom the lady giving birth is married. The provision makes the legitimacy of the child to be a conclusive proof, if the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. It can be denied only if it is shown that the parties to the marriage have no access to each other at any time when the child could have been begotten. Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded that the husband had access to her and, in fact, the child was born in the said wedlock, but the husband had specifically pleaded that after his wife left the matrimonial home, she did not return and thereafter, he had no access to her. The wife has admitted that she had left the matrimonial home but again joined her husband. Unfortunately, none of the courts below have given any finding with regard to this plea of the husband that he had or had not any access to his wife at the time when the child could have been begotten.

As stated earlier, the DNA test is an accurate test and on that basis it is clear that the appellant is not the biological father of the girl- child. However, at the same time, the condition precedent for invocation of Section 112 of the Evidence Act has been established and no finding with regard to the plea of the husband that he had no access to his wife at the time when the child could have been begotten has been recorded. Admittedly, the child has been born during the continuance of a valid marriage. Therefore, the provisions of Section 112 of the Evidence Act conclusively prove that respondent No. 2 is the daughter of the appellant. At the same time, the DNA test reports, based on scientific analysis, in no uncertain terms suggest that the appellant is not the biological father. In such circumstance, which would give way to the other is a complex question posed before us.

We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific advancement and DNA test were not even in contemplation of the Legislature. The result of DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. Although Section 112 raises a presumption of conclusive proof on satisfaction of the conditions enumerated therein but the same is rebuttable. The presumption may afford legitimate means of arriving at an affirmative legal conclusion. While the truth or fact is known, in our opinion, there is no need or room for any presumption. Where there is evidence to the contrary, the presumption is rebuttable and must yield to proof. Interest of justice is best served by ascertaining the truth and the court should be furnished with the best available science and may not be left to bank upon presumptions, unless science has no answer to the facts in issue. In our opinion, when there is a conflict between a conclusive proof envisaged under law and a proof based on scientific advancement accepted by the world community to be correct, the latter must prevail over the former.

We must understand the distinction between a legal fiction and the presumption of a fact. Legal fiction assumes existence of a fact which may not really exist. However presumption of a fact depends on satisfaction of certain circumstances. Those circumstances logically would lead to the fact sought to be presumed. Section 112 of the Evidence Act does not create a legal fiction but provides for presumption.

The husband’s plea that he had no access to the wife when the child was begotten stands proved by the DNA test report and in the face of it, we cannot compel the appellant to bear the fatherhood of a child, when the scientific reports prove to the contrary. We are conscious that an innocent child may not be bastardized as the marriage between her mother and father was subsisting at the time of her birth, but in view of the DNA test reports and what we have observed above, we cannot forestall the consequence. It is denying the truth. “Truth must triumph” is the hallmark of justice.

As regards the authority of this Court in the case of Kamti Devi (Supra), this Court on appreciation of evidence came to the conclusion that the husband had no opportunity whatsoever to have liaison with the wife. There was no DNA test held in the case. In the said background i.e. non- access of the husband with the wife, this Court held that the result of DNA test “is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Act”. The judgment has to be understood in the factual scenario of the said case. The said judgment has not held that DNA test is to be ignored. In fact, this Court has taken note of the fact that DNA test is scientifically accurate. We hasten to add that in none of the cases referred to above, this Court was confronted with a situation in which DNA test report, in fact, was available and was in conflict with the presumption of conclusive proof of legitimacy of the child under Section 112 of the Evidence Act. In view of what we have observed above, these judgments in no way advance the case of the respondents",1
M/s Stanzen Toyotetsu India P. Ltd,"The short question that falls for determination in these appeals is whether the High Court so also the Courts below were right in holding that the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the appellant-company against its employees (respondents herein) ought to remain stayed pending conclusion of the criminal case instituted against the respondents in respect of the very same incident.

3. The appellant-company is engaged in the manufacture of automobile parts in the name and style of M/s Stanzen Toyotetsu India Pvt. Ltd. while the respondents are workmen engaged by the appellant in connection with the said business. It is not in dispute that the employees of the appellant- company including the respondents are governed by Standing Orders certified under Industrial Employees (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.

4. The appellant’s case is that on 19th March, 2011 at about 10.30 p.m. the respondents with the help of other Trade Union functionaries stage managed an accident making it appear as if an employee by the name of Mr. Kusumadhara had slipped and fallen in the press area. The incident was, it is alleged, used as a ruse by the respondents who rushed to the place of alleged fall only to create a ruckus. Appellant’s further case is that although Mr. Kusumadhara had not sustained any injury, he was sent to the hospital in the ambulance of the appellant-company and that instead of resuming the work after the alleged incident, the respondents stopped the production activity and started abusing their superiors, damaged property of the company and even assaulted senior managerial personnel. These acts of indiscipline created an atmosphere of fear and tension in the factory and brought the production activity to a grinding halt. Senior managerial personnel injured in the incident were, according to the appellant, unable to report for work for about 15 days on account of assault on them.

5. Taking note of the incident and the acts of indiscipline which amounted to misconduct under several provisions of the Standing Order, the competent authority placed the respondents under suspension and issued charge-sheets to them. The explanation submitted by the respondents having been found unsatisfactory, a disciplinary enquiry was initiated and Enquiry Officers appointed to enquire into the allegations against the respondents. The Presenting Officers have examined one witness in each one of the enquiries.

6. The incident in question was it appears reported even to the police by one of the employees of the appellant-company who was a witness to the same, leading to the registration of Crime No.173/2011 in Ramanagara Rural Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 356, 427, 504, 506, 114 read with Section 149 I.P.C. A charge-sheet was filed pursuant to the said report and investigation is pending in which the respondents are accused of committing the offences mentioned above.

7. While the disciplinary enquiry and the criminal case were both pending, the respondents filed Original Suits No.326-331 of 2011 in which they prayed for a permanent injunction against the appellant and the Enquiry Officers restraining them from proceeding with the enquiry pending conclusion of the criminal case. Interlocutory Applications seeking temporary injunctions in each one of the suits against the on-going enquiry were also filed in the said suits. The applications though opposed by the appellant-company were allowed by the Principal Civil Judge and JMFC Ramanagara by an order dated 13th October, 2011 staying the domestic enquiry pending against the respondents till the disposal of criminal case in C.C. No.1005 of 2011.

8. Misc. Appeals No.56/2011 and 61/2011 filed by the appellant against the said order before the Principal Senior Civil Judge and CJM Ramanagara having failed, the appellant filed Writ Petitions No.8487-8491 of 2012 (GM- CPC) and W.P. No.9381 of 2012 (GM-CPC) before the High Court of Karnataka which petitions too failed and have been dismissed by the High Court in terms of a common order dated 15th June, 2012 impugned in the present appeals. In the result the disciplinary enquiry pending against the respondents remained stayed pending conclusion of the criminal trial. The present appeals, as noticed earlier, assailed the correctness of the said judgment and orders.

9. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at some length. The only question that falls for determination in the above backdrop is whether the Courts below were justified in staying the on-going disciplinary proceedings pending conclusion of the trial in the criminal case registered and filed against the respondents. The answer to that question would primarily depend upon whether there is any legal bar to the continuance of the disciplinary proceedings against the employees based on an incident which is also the subject matter of criminal case against such employees. It would also depend upon the nature of the charges in the criminal case filed against the employees and whether the case involves complicated questions of law and fact. The possibility of prejudice to the employees accused in the criminal case on account of the parallel disciplinary enquiry going ahead is another dimension which will have to be addressed while permitting or staying such disciplinary enquiry proceedings. The law on the subject is fairly well- settled for similar issues and has often engaged the attention of this Court in varied fact situations. Although the pronouncements of this Court have stopped short of prescribing any strait-jacket formula for application to all cases the decisions of this Court have identified the broad approach to be adopted in such matters leaving it for the Courts concerned to take an appropriate view in the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case that comes up before them. Suffice it to say that there is no short cut solution to the problem. What is, however, fairly well settled and was not disputed even before us is that there is no legal bar to the conduct of the disciplinary proceedings and a criminal trial simultaneously. In Depot Manager, Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation vs. Mohd. Yousuf Miyan (1997) 2 SCC 699, this Court declared that the purpose underlying departmental proceedings is distinctly different from the purpose behind prosecution of offenders for commission of offences by them. While criminal prosecution for an offence is launched for violation of a duty that the offender owes to the society, departmental enquiry is aimed at maintaining discipline and efficiency in service. The difference in the standard of proof and the application of the rules of evidence to one and inapplicability to the other was also explained and highlighted only to explain that conceptually the two operate in different spheres and are intended to serve distinctly different purposes. The relatively recent decision of this Court in Divisional Controller, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation v. M.G. Vittal Rao (2012) 1 SCC 442, is a timely reminder of the principles that are applicable in such situations succinctly summed up in the following words:

“(i) There is no legal bar for both proceedings to go on simultaneously.
(ii) The only valid ground for claiming that the disciplinary proceedings may be stayed would be to ensure that the defence of the employee in the criminal case may not be prejudiced. But even such grounds would be available only in cases involving complex questions of facts and law.
(iii) Such defence ought not to be permitted to unnecessarily delay the departmental proceedings. The interest of the delinquent officer as well as the employer clearly lies in a prompt conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings.
(iv) Departmental Proceedings can go on simultaneously to the criminal trial, except where both the proceedings are based on the same set of facts and the evidence in both the proceedings is common.”
10. We may also refer to the decision of this Court in Capt. M Paul Anthony v. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd, (1999) 3 SCC 679 where this Court reviewed the case law on the subject to identify the following broad principles for application in the facts and circumstances of a given case:

“(i) Departmental proceedings and proceedings in a criminal case can proceed simultaneously as there is no bar in their being conducted simultaneously, though separately.
(ii) If the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar set of facts and the charge in the criminal case against the delinquent employee is of a grave nature which involves complicated questions of law and fact, it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case.
(iii) Whether the nature of a charge in a criminal case is grave and whether complicated questions of fact and law are involved in that case, will depend upon the nature of offence, the nature of the case launched against the employee on the basis of evidence and material collected against him during investigation or as reflected in the charge sheet.
(iv) The factors mentioned at (ii) and (iii) above cannot be considered in isolation to stay the Departmental proceedings but due regard has to be given to the fact that the departmental proceedings cannot be unduly delayed.
(v) If the criminal case does not proceed or its disposal is being unduly delayed, the departmental proceedings, even if they were stayed on account of the pendency of the criminal case, can be resumed and proceeded with so as to conclude them at an early date, so that if the employee is found not guilty his honor may be vindicated and in case he is found guilty, administration may get rid of him at the earliest.”
11. In HPCL v. Sarvesh Berry (2005) 10 SCC 471 the respondent was charged with possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. The question was whether disciplinary proceedings should remain stayed pending a criminal charge being examined by the competent criminal Court. Allowing the appeal of the employer-corporation this Court held:

“A crime is an act of commission in violation of law or of omission of public duty. The departmental enquiry is to maintain discipline in the service and efficiency of public service. It would, therefore, be expedient that the disciplinary proceedings are conducted and completed as expeditiously as possible. It is not, therefore, desirable to lay down any guidelines as inflexible rules in which the departmental proceedings may or may not be stayed pending trial in criminal case against the delinquent officer. Each case requires to be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. There would be no bar to proceed simultaneously with departmental enquiry and trial of a criminal case unless the charge in the criminal trial is of a grave nature involving complicated questions of fact and law….. Under these circumstances, what is required to be seen is whether the departmental enquiry would seriously prejudice the delinquent in his defense at the trial in a criminal case. It is always a question of fact to be considered in each case depending on its own facts and circumstances.” (emphasis supplied)
12. It is unnecessary to multiply decisions on the subject for the legal position as emerging from the above pronouncements and the earlier pronouncements of this Court in a large number of similar cases is well settled that disciplinary proceedings and proceedings in a criminal case can proceed simultaneously in the absence of any legal bar to such simultaneity. It is also evident that while seriousness of the charge leveled against the employees is a consideration, the same is not by itself sufficient unless the case also involves complicated questions of law and fact. Even when the charge is found to be serious and complicated questions of fact and law that arise for consideration, the Court will have to keep in mind the fact that departmental proceedings cannot be suspended indefinitely or delayed unduly. In Paul Anthony (supra) this Court went a step further to hold that departmental proceedings can be resumed and proceeded even when they may have been stayed earlier in cases where the criminal trial does not make any headway. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan v. B.K.Meena 1996(6) SCC 417, where this Court reiterated that there was no legal bar for both proceedings to go on simultaneously unless there is a likelihood of the employee suffering prejudice in the criminal trial. What is significant is that the likelihood of prejudice itself is hedged by providing that not only should the charge be grave but even the case must involve complicated questions of law and fact. Stay of proceedings at any rate cannot and should not be a matter of course. The following passage is in this regard apposite:

“there is no legal bar for both proceedings to go on simultaneously and then say that in certain situations, it may not be 'desirable', 'advisable' or 'appropriate' to proceed with the disciplinary enquiry when a criminal case is pending on identical charges. The staying of disciplinary proceedings, is a matter to be determined having regard to the facts and circumstances of a given case and that no hard and fast rules can enunciated in that behalf. The only ground suggested in the above questions as constitution a valid ground for staying the disciplinary proceedings is that the defence of the employee in the criminal case may not be prejudiced. This ground has, however, been hedged in by providing further that this may be done in cases of grave nature involving questions of fact and law. In our respectful opinion, it means that not only the charges must be grave but that the case must involve complicated questions of law and fact. Moreover, 'advisability', 'desirability' or 'propriety', as the case may be, has to be determined in each case taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case. While it is not possible to enumerate the various factors, for and against the stay of disciplinary proceedings, we found it necessary to emphasize some of the important considerations in view of the fact that very often the disciplinary proceedings are being stayed for long periods pending criminal proceedings. Stay of disciplinary proceedings cannot be, and should not be, a matter of course. All the relevant factors, for and against, should be weighed and a decision taken keeping in view the various principles laid down in the decisions referred to above. … Indeed, in such cases, it is all the more in the interest of the charged officer that the proceedings are expeditiously concluded. Delay in such cases really works against him.” (emphasis supplied)
13. Suffice it to say that while there is no legal bar to the holding of the disciplinary proceedings and the criminal trial simultaneously, stay of disciplinary proceedings may be an advisable course in cases where the criminal charge against the employee is grave and continuance of the disciplinary proceedings is likely to prejudice their defense before the criminal Court. Gravity of the charge is, however, not by itself enough to determine the question unless the charge involves complicated question of law and fact. The Court examining the question must also keep in mind that criminal trials get prolonged indefinitely especially where the number of accused arraigned for trial is large as is the case at hand and so are the number of witnesses cited by the prosecution. The Court, therefore, has to draw a balance between the need for a fair trial to the accused on the one hand and the competing demand for an expeditious conclusion of the on-going disciplinary proceedings on the other. An early conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings has itself been seen by this Court to be in the interest of the employees.

14. The charges leveled against the respondents in the instant case are under Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 356, 427, 504, 506, 114 read with Section 149 I.P.C. These are no ordinary offences being punishable with imprisonment which may extend upto 3 years besides fine. At the same time seriousness of the charge alone is not the test. What is also required to be demonstrated by the respondents is that the case involves complicated questions of law and fact. That requirement does not appear to be satisfied in an adequate measure to call for an unconditional and complete stay of the disciplinary proceedings pending conclusion of the trial. The incident as reported in the first information report or as projected by the respondents in the suits filed by them does not suggest any complication or complexity either on facts or law.

15. That apart the respondents have already disclosed the defense in the explanation submitted by them before the commencement of the departmental enquiry in which one witness has been examined by each of the Enquiry Officers. The charge sheet, it is evident from the record, was filed on 20th August, 2011. The charges were framed on 20th December, 2011. The Trial Court has ever since then examined only three witnesses so far out of a total of 23 witnesses cited in the charge-sheet. Going by the pace at which the Trial Court is examining the witnesses it would take another five years before the trial may be concluded. The High Court has in the judgment under appeal given five months to the Trial Court to conclude the trial. More than fifteen months has rolled by ever since that order, without the trial going anywhere near completion. Disciplinary proceedings cannot remain stayed for an indefinitely long period. Such inordinate delay is neither in the interest of the appellant-company nor the respondents who are under suspension and surviving on subsistence allowance. The number of accused implicated in the case is also very large. We are not suggesting that the incident must be taken to be false only because such a large number could not participate in the incident. But there is a general tendency to spread the net wider and even implicate those who were not concerned with the commission of the offences or who even though present committed no overt act to show that they shared the common object of the assembly or be responsible for the riotous behaviour of other accused persons. Interest of such accused as may be innocent also cannot be ignored nor can they be made to suffer indefinitely just because some others have committed an offence or offences.

16. In the circumstances and taking into consideration all aspects mentioned above as also keeping in view the fact that all the three Courts below have exercised their discretion in favour of staying the on-going disciplinary proceedings, we do not consider it fit to vacate the said order straightaway. Interests of justice would, in our opinion, be sufficiently served if we direct the Court dealing with the criminal charges against the respondents to conclude the proceedings as expeditiously as possible but in any case within a period of one year from the date of this order. We hope and trust that the Trial Court will take effective steps to ensure that the witnesses are served, appear and are examined. The Court may for that purpose adjourn the case for no more than a fortnight every time an adjournment is necessary. We also expect the accused in the criminal case to co-operate with the trial Court for an early completion of the proceedings. We say so because experience has shown that trials often linger on for a long time on account of non- availability of the defense lawyers to cross-examine the witnesses or on account of adjournments sought by them on the flimsiest of the grounds. All that needs to be avoided. In case, however, the trial is not completed within the period of one year from the date of this order, despite the steps which the Trial Court has been directed to take the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the respondents shall be resumed and concluded by the Inquiry Officer concerned. The impugned orders shall in that case stand vacated upon expiry of the period of one year from the date of the order",1
SANJAY KUMAR,"This appeal has been filed against the final impugned judgment and order dated 21.03.2013 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in MAC Appeal No.549 of 2007, urging various legal grounds and contentions for further enhancement of compensation in the case of a motor accident involving the appellant whereby the High Court enhanced the compensation awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Delhi (in short ‘the Tribunal’) by [pic]1,52,336/- to a total sum of [pic]6,35,808/-. The Tribunal had awarded compensation of [pic]4,83,472/- under various heads along with 7% interest per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization of payment.

3. The brief facts of the case are given hereunder:

The appellant, Sanjay Kumar received injuries in a roadside accident on 28.09.2005 due to the rash and negligent driving of the Truck No.HR-38D-9546, the offending vehicle. The appellant remained under treatment from 26.10.2005 to 10.12.2005 and due to injuries sustained, his right leg above the knee had to be amputated. As per Entry 18 in Part II of Schedule I of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, the loss of earning capacity was assessed at 70% due to the permanent disability suffered by the appellant on account of post- traumatic amputation of his right leg above the knee. The appellant was employed as an embroidery worker and claimed compensation of [pic]15 lakhs from the respondents. Respondent No.1 is the owner and respondent No.2 is the insurer of the offending vehicle. The appellant examined two witnesses in support of his claim and documents were taken on record as evidence. PW-1 Sushil Kumar, the record clerk who filed treatment record and MLC as Ex.PW-1/A and Ex.PW-1/B respectively, and, PW-2 Sanjay Kumar, the appellant himself, and he filed his treatment record and bills as Exs.PW-2/1 to PW-2/19, his permanent disability certificate Ex.PW-2/20 and concession certificate Ex.PW-2/21. The respondents did not lead any evidence.

4. The Tribunal held that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle as a result of which the appellant sustained injuries and awarded pecuniary as well as non- pecuniary damages. The compensation was calculated by assigning minimum wages at [pic]3166/- per month, of which loss of earning capacity was calculated at 70% which comes to [pic]2216/- per month, i.e. [pic]26,592/- per annum. Multiplier of 16 was taken. A lump sum compensation of [pic]8000/- was given to the appellant under the head of ‘medical expenses’. Hence, the total pecuniary compensation given was [pic]4,33,472/-. A sum of [pic]50,000/- was given as non-pecuniary damages on account of mental pain and agony and loss of future enjoyment of life suffered by him. Thus, a total compensation of [pic]4,83,472/- was awarded to the appellant with interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization. Both the respondents were held to be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation but respondent No.2 being the insurer was held to have the primary obligation to pay compensation on behalf of the insured and was directed to deposit the award amount within one month from the date of the order.

5. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the appellant filed an appeal in the High Court asking for enhancement of the compensation on the ground that the Tribunal ought to have awarded enhanced compensation on the basis of evidence adduced. The contentions of the appellant will be taken up in detail at a later stage. The High Court enhanced the compensation to [pic]6,35,808/- by awarding [pic]5,42,808/- under the head ‘loss of future earning capacity’ by taking a multiplier of 18. Further, [pic]25,000/- as conveyance charges and [pic]10,000/- as Attendant charges were also awarded. The compensation of [pic] 50,000/- awarded under the head ‘Mental pain and agony’ and [pic]8,000/- for medical bills as awarded by the Tribunal was maintained as it is. Therefore, the High Court awarded a sum of [pic]1,52,336/- over and above the compensation awarded by the Tribunal at the same rate of interest i.e. 7% per annum and the respondent No.2 was directed to pay this enhanced amount with interest in favour of the appellant within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of the order.

6. Not satisfied with the compensation awarded by the High Court, the appellant has appealed to this Court, urging various legal contentions in support of further enhancement of the compensation.

7. The learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the appellant was employed as an embroiderer and that it is a skilled job and he used to earn [pic]4500/- per month. Further, he is entitled to compensation against loss of future prospects in income and that the compensation under the head of ‘pain and suffering’ should not be less than [pic]2 lacs as the permanent disability is 70% and that his marriage prospects have been greatly diminished because of the accident and he should be awarded compensation under the head, ‘loss of marriage prospects’ as well. It was also contended that the High Court was not justified in not awarding compensation for the loss of earning for at least 3 months during the appellant’s treatment period. Further, on the point of interest, it was contended that the High Court should have enhanced the rate of interest from 7% to 9% per annum.

8. We have heard the rival legal contentions advanced on behalf of the parties. In our considered view, the appellant is entitled to be awarded compensation based on the wages for a skilled worker, as he is an embroiderer and the same cannot be considered as an unskilled work. The minimum wages in Delhi for a skilled worker as on 01.08.2005 was [pic]3589.90/- per month. The appellant has claimed that he was earning [pic]4,500/- per month from his work as an embroiderer. We will accept his claim as it is not practical to expect a worker in the unorganized sector to provide documentary evidence of his monthly income as per decision of this Court in the case of Ramachandrappa v. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited [1], wherein it was held as under:-

“13. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the appellant was aged about 35 years and was working as a coolie and was earning Rs. 4500/- per month at the time of the accident. This claim is reduced by the Tribunal to a sum of Rs. 3000/- only on the assumption that the wages of a labourer during the relevant period viz. in the year 2004, was Rs. 100/- per day. This assumption in our view has no basis. Before the Tribunal, though the Insurance Company was served, it did not choose to appear before the court nor did it repudiate the claim of the claimant. Therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal to have reduced the claim of the claimant and determined the monthly earning to be a sum of Rs 3000/- per month. Secondly, the appellant was working as a coolie and therefore, we cannot expect him to produce any documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. In the absence of any other evidence contrary to the claim made by the claimant, in our view, in the facts of the present case, the Tribunal should have accepted the claim of the claimant.
14. We hasten to add that in all cases and in all circumstances, the Tribunal need not accept the claim of the claimant in the absence of supporting material. It depends on the facts of each case. In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guesswork, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time.
15. In the present case, the appellant was working as a coolie and in and around the date of the accident, the wage of a labourer was between Rs. 100/- to Rs 150/-
per day or Rs. 4500/- per month. In our view, the claim was honest and bona fide and, therefore, there was no reason for the Tribunal to have reduced the monthly earning of the appellant from Rs. 4500/- to Rs. 3000/- per month. We, therefore, accept his statement that his monthly earning was Rs. 4500/-.” Thus, in the present case, a monthly income of [pic]4,500/- as claimed by the appellant for his work as an embroiderer is reflective of ground realities and is not exorbitant by any standard and in the interest of justice, we should accept his claim. Further, he was also not cross-examined on the aspect of the nature of his work as an embroiderer and both the Tribunal and the High Court have erred in holding that the appellant’s work was of an unskilled nature.

9. ‘Loss of future prospects’ should be added to this amount as it cannot be accepted that an embroiderer will not have a future increment in income. As per the case of Sarla Verma & Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr.[2], keeping in mind the young age of the appellant, he is entitled to 50% of his income as future increase in income ([pic]4,500/- + 2250/- = [pic]6750/-). We will apply a multiplier of 18 as taken by the High Court in the impugned judgment and as per Sarla Verma’s case (supra). The appellant’s permanent disability and loss of earning capacity was assessed at 70% and we will not interfere with that. Hence, the total amount of compensation due to loss of earning capacity along with future prospects in income will come to [pic]10,20,600/-[[pic]6,750 x 70/100 x 12 x 18].

10. Further, in the case of Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar & Anr.[3], this Court has succinctly explained the guidelines and heads for awarding compensation in cases of disability due to a motor accident. The relevant paragraphs are extracted below:

“6. The heads under which compensation is awarded in personal injury cases are the following:
Pecuniary damages (Special damages)
(i) Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalisation, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.
(ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising:
(a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment;
(b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability.
(iii) Future medical expenses.
Non-pecuniary damages (General damages)
(iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries.
(v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).
(vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity).
In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be awarded only under heads (i), (ii)(a) and (iv). It is only in serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b), (iii), (v) and
(vi) relating to loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability, future medical expenses, loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and loss of expectation of life.
7. Assessment of pecuniary damages under Item (i) and under Item (ii)(a) do not pose much difficulty as they involve reimbursement of actuals and are easily ascertainable from the evidence. Award under the head of future medical expenses—Item
(iii)—depends upon specific medical evidence regarding need for further treatment and cost thereof. Assessment of non-pecuniary damages—Items (iv), (v) and (vi)—involves determination of lump sum amounts with reference to circumstances such as age, nature of injury/deprivation/disability suffered by the claimant and the effect thereof on the future life of the claimant. Decisions of this Court and the High Courts contain necessary guidelines for award under these heads, if necessary. What usually poses some difficulty is the assessment of the loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability—Item
(ii)(a).”
11. The appellant has further contended that he should be awarded compensation for loss of income suffered during the period of treatment i.e. 26.10.2005 to 10.12.2005. As the accident took place on 28.09.2005, this comes to a period of around 3 months. Keeping in view the principles espoused in the aforesaid judgment, we hereby award an amount of [pic]13,500/- for this period ([pic]4,500 x 3) taking the monthly income of [pic]4,500/-, thus, bringing the total compensation under the broad head of loss of income to [pic]10,34,100/-.

12. Now, we will assess the compensation awarded under the other heads. With respect to medical expenses, attendant charges and conveyance charges, as well as possible future medical costs, we will award a total sum of [pic]75,000/- as he has suffered permanent disability due to amputation of his right leg. The appellant will need assistance in order to travel and move around, and regular check-ups and will most likely use a crutch to walk, all of which will incur expenses. On the point of loss of marriage prospects, we feel that it is a major loss, keeping in mind the young age of the appellant and the High Court has gravely erred in not awarding adequate compensation separately under this head and instead clubbed it under ‘loss of future enjoyment of life’ and ‘pain and suffering’. We thereby award [pic]75,000/- towards loss of marriage prospects. Further, as per the case of Govind Yadav v. New India Insurance Co. Ltd.[4], wherein the appellant suffered amputation of the leg, this Court awarded a sum of [pic]1,50,000/- towards ‘pain and suffering’ caused due to amputation of the leg. Therefore, towards ‘mental agony and pain and suffering’, we award a sum of [pic]1,50,000/- as the appellant has suffered tremendously due to the accident in terms of the pain and suffering involved in the amputation. Loss of a limb causes a profusion of distress and the appellant has to deal with the same for the rest of his life. We feel it is justified to award the aforesaid amount under this head as he might have to deal with discrimination and stigma in society due to the fact that he is an amputee.

13. Further, it is necessary to award an amount under the head of ‘loss of amenities’ also as the appellant will definitely deal with loss of future amenities as he has lost a leg due to the accident. The injury has permanently disabled the appellant, thereby reducing his enjoyment of life and the full pursuit of all the activities he engaged in prior to the accident. We thereby award a sum of [pic]1,00,000/- towards ‘loss of amenities’. Along with the compensation under conventional heads, the appellant is also entitled to costs of litigation as per the legal principle laid down in the case of Dr. Balram Prasad v. Dr. Kunal Saha & Ors.[5] Therefore, under this head, we find it just and proper to award [pic]25,000/- towards costs of litigation.

14. Thus, the total compensation, the appellant is entitled to is given hereunder:

      |Head of compensation      |Amount                        |
|Loss of income:           |                              |
|Loss of earning capacity  |[pic]10,20,600/- +            |
|and future prospects of   |[pic]13,500/- =               |
|income +                  |[pic]10,34,100/-              |
|Loss of earnings during   |                              |
|period of treatment       |                              |
|Medical expenses,         |      [pic]75,000/-           |
|attendant and conveyance  |                              |
|costs and future medical  |                              |
|costs                     |                              |
|Loss of marriage prospects|      [pic]75,000/-           |
|Mental agony, pain and    |    [pic]1,50,000/-           |
|suffering                 |                              |
|Loss of amenities         |    [pic]1,00,000/-           |
|Cost of litigation        |      [pic]25,000/-           |
|Total compensation:       |   [pic]14,59,100/-           |




15. Further, as per the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Uphaar Tragedy Victims Association & Ors.[6], we find it just and proper to increase the interest awarded from 7% to 9% per annum. Hence, the total compensation the appellant is entitled to is [pic]14,59,100/- along with 9% interest per annum from the date of the accident till the date of realization.

16. The Insurance Company is directed to deposit 50% of the awarded amount with proportionate interest within four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, after deducting the amount if already paid, in any of the Nationalized Bank of the choice of the appellant for a period of 3 years. During the said period, if he wants to withdraw a portion or entire deposited amount for his personal or any other expenses, including development of his asset, then he is at liberty to file application before the Tribunal for release of the deposited amount, which may be considered by it and pass appropriate order in this regard.

The rest of 50% amount awarded with proportionate interest shall be paid to the appellant/claimant by way of a demand draft within four weeks. The Insurance Company is further directed to submit compliance report before this court within six week",1
PAWAN KUMAR & ANR. ETC.,"The appellants were the claimants in the proceedings instituted for award of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”). They are aggrieved by the decision of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in F.A.O. Nos. 695, 407 and 408 of 1995 dated 05.07.2006 by which, though their claim for compensation has been upheld, the liability to pay the same has been apportioned between the drivers/owners of the two vehicles involved in the motor accident. The appellants contend that as they were third parties to the claim, the High Court ought to have made the drivers/owners of the vehicles jointly and severally liable to pay compensation in view of their composite negligence instead of apportioning their liability by invoking the principle of contributory negligence.

2. The brief facts that will be required to be noticed may now be set out:

Deceased Yogesh (12 years) and Parshotam D. Gupta and injured Salochna were travelling in Jeep No.PB-03-6848 from Sirsa, Haryana to Vaishno Devi on 19.06.1993. The jeep which is owned by the respondent No.1 and driven by the respondent No.2 met with an accident with a truck coming from the opposite direction as a result of which Parshotam D. Gupta and Yogesh died on the spot whereas Salochna received serious injuries. Claim petitions were filed by the parents of Yogesh and the legal heirs of deceased Parshotam Dass including Salochna who is his wife. The injured Salochna also filed a separate claim petition in respect of the injuries sustained by her in the same accident. As the truck involved in the accident had fled from the spot, the driver/owner and insurer of the said truck could not be impleaded in any of the claim petitions filed by the claimants.

The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (for short “the Tribunal) by its award dated 07.11.1994 held that the truck alone was responsible for the accident and in the absence of the driver/owner or the insurer of the said vehicle, no compensation can be awarded to any of the claimants. Aggrieved, the matter was carried in appeal. The High Court by its order dated 05.07.2006 held that both the truck as well as the jeep, in which the deceased and the injured were travelling, were responsible for the accident. The High Court further held that the liability of the driver/owner of the truck should be estimated at 70% and that of the driver/owner of the jeep at 30%. Accordingly, the High Court held that in respect of the death of Yogesh, compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- would be the just and fair compensation payable to the legal heirs. 30% thereof i.e. Rs.60,000/- was held to be payable by the driver/owner/insurer of the jeep. In respect of deceased Parshotam, the High Court held that the amount of compensation payable would be Rs.5,76,000/- and accordingly made the respondent Nos.1, 2 and 3 (insurer) liable to pay 30% of the said compensation which comes to Rs.1,72,800/-. Insofar as the injuries sustained by Salochna is concerned, the High Court computed the amount of compensation payable at Rs.2,00,000/- and made the respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 liable for compensation to the extent of 30% of the said amount i.e. Rs.60,000/-. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellants/claimants have filed the present appeal.

3. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.

4. Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that though the High Court has rightly held both the vehicles to be responsible for the accident it has committed a glaring error in invoking the principle of contributory negligence in the present case and in apportioning the liability between the drivers/owners of the two vehicles. Relying on the decision of this Court in T.O. Anthony Vs. Karvarnan & Ors.[1] which has been followed in a subsequent decision in Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation & Anr. Vs. K. Hemlatha & Ors.[2], learned counsel has urged that in a case where the claimant is a third party (other than the driver/owner of the vehicles involved in the accident) the correct principle for determination of the liability is that of composite negligence which would make the drivers/owners of the two vehicles jointly and severally liable. The principle of contributory negligence so as to apportion the liability between the drivers/owners would be relevant only if the claim for compensation is by one of the drivers himself or by his legal heirs, as the case may be. It is, therefore, contended that the apportionment made by the High Court is against the settled principles of law laid down by this Court.

5. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1 has argued that even if the view taken by the High Court that both the vehicles were responsible for the accident is to be accepted, the liability of the joint tortfeasors has to be apportioned which has been so done by the High Court. It is also submitted that in the absence of any specific material the apportionment of compensation, as determined by the High Court, ought not to be disturbed.

6. The distinction between the principles of composite and contributory negligence has been dealt with in Winfield & Jolowicz on Tort (Chapter 21) (15th Edition, 1998). It would be appropriate to notice the following passage from the said work:-

“WHERE two or more people by their independent breaches of duty to the plaintiff cause him to suffer distinct injuries, no special rules are required, for each tortfeasor is liable for the damage which he caused and only for that damage. Where, however, two or more breaches of duty by different persons cause the plaintiff to suffer a single injury the position is more complicated. The law in such a case is that the plaintiff is entitled to sue all or any of them for the full amount of his loss, and each is said to be jointly and severally liable for it. This means that special rules are necessary to deal with the possibilities of successive actions in respect of that loss and of claims for contribution or indemnity by one tortfeasor against the others. It is greatly to the plaintiff’s advantage to show that that he has suffered the same, indivisible harm at the hands of a number of defendants for he thereby avoids the risk, inherent in cases where there are different injuries, of finding that one defendant is insolvent (or uninsured) and being unable to execute judgment against him. The same picture is not, of course, so attractive from the point of view of the solvent defendant, who may end up carrying full responsibility for a loss in the causing of which he played only a partial, even secondary role.
………………………………………………………………..……………………………………………………………………..
The question of whether there is one injury can be a difficult one. The simplest case is that of two virtually simultaneous acts of negligence, as where two drivers behave negligently and collide, injuring a passenger in one of the cars or a pedestrian, but there is no requirement that the acts be simultaneous. ……………..”
7. Where the plaintiff/claimant himself is found to be a party to the negligence the question of joint and several liability cannot arise and the plaintiff’s claim to the extent of his own negligence, as may be quantified, will have to be severed. In such a situation the plaintiff can only be held entitled to such part of damages/compensation that is not attributable to his own negligence. The above principle has been explained in T.O. Anthony (supra) followed in K. Hemlatha & Ors. (supra). Paras 6 and 7 of T.O. Anthony (supra) which are relevant may be extracted hereinbelow:

“6. “Composite negligence” refers to the negligence on the part of two or more persons. Where a person is injured as a result of negligence on the part of two or more wrongdoers, it is said that the person was injured on account of the composite negligence of those wrongdoers. In such a case, each wrongdoer is jointly and severally liable to the injured for payment of the entire damages and the injured person has the choice of proceeding against all or any of them. In such a case, the injured need not establish the extent of responsibility of each wrongdoer separately, nor is it necessary for the court to determine the extent of liability of each wrongdoer separately. On the other hand where a person suffers injury, partly due to the negligence on the part of another person or persons, and partly as a result of his own negligence, then the negligence on the part of the injured which contributed to the accident is referred to as his contributory negligence. Where the injured is guilty of some negligence, his claim for damages is not defeated merely by reason of the negligence on his part but the damages recoverable by him in respect of the injuries stand reduced in proportion to his contributory negligence.
7. Therefore, when two vehicles are involved in an accident, and one of the drivers claims compensation from the other driver alleging negligence, and the other driver denies negligence or claims that the injured claimant himself was negligent, then it becomes necessary to consider whether the injured claimant was negligent and if so, whether he was solely or partly responsible for the accident and the extent of his responsibility, that is, his contributory negligence. Therefore where the injured is himself partly liable, the principle of “composite negligence” will not apply nor can there be an automatic inference that the negligence was 50:50 as has been assumed in this case. The Tribunal ought to have examined the extent of contributory negligence of the appellant and thereby avoided confusion between composite negligence and contributory negligence. The High Court has failed to correct the said error.”
8. In the present case, neither the driver/owner nor the insurer has filed any appeal or cross objection against the findings of the High Court that both the vehicles were responsible for the accident. In the absence of any challenge to the aforesaid part of the order of the High Court, we ought to proceed in the matter by accepting the said finding of the High Court. From the discussions that have preceded, it is clear that the High Court was not correct in apportioning the liability for the accident between drivers/owners of the two vehicles.",1
Km. Hema Mishra,"Appellant herein had invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking the following reliefs:

i) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Certiorari thereby quashing the impugned FIR dated 21.12.2011, contained in Annexure No. 1 to this writ petition, lodged at crime No. 797/11 under Sections 419/420 IPC, at Police Station Zaidpur, District Barabanki;

ii) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus thereby directing the Superintendant of Police, Barabanki, the opposite Party No. 2, and the Investigating Officer, Case Crime No. 797/11, under Sections 419/420 IPC, Police Station, Zaidpur, District Barabanki, the opposite party No. 3, to defer the arrest of the petitioner until collection of the credible evidence sufficient for filing the charge-sheet by following the amended proviso to Sections 41(1)(b) read with Section 41A CrPC;

iii) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus thereby directing the Superintendent of Police, Barabanki, the opposite party No. 2, for compliance of the provision of Sections 41(1)(b) and 41A CrPC in the investigation of the impugned FIR dated 21.12.2011 contained in Annexure No. 1 to this writ petition, lodged in crime No. 797/11, under Sections 419/420 IPC, Zaidpur, District Barabanki; and

iv) Allow this writ petition with costs.

3. The High Court, after hearing the parties as well as the State, dismissed the writ petition on 9.1.2012 and passed the following order:

“Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Government Advocate. Under challenge in the instant writ petition is FIR relating to Case Crime No. 797 of 2011, under Sections 419 & 420 IPC, police station Zaidpur, district Barabanki. We have gone through the FIR, which discloses commission of cognizable offence, as such, the same cannot be quashed. The writ petition lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.
However, the petitioner being lady, it is provided that if she surrenders and moves application for bail the same shall be considered and decided by the courts below expeditiously.”
4. The appellant, complaining that she was falsely implicated in the case, has approached this Court contending that the High Court had failed to exercise its certiorari jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in not quashing the FIR dated 21.12.2011 and in refusing to grant anticipatory bail to the appellant. Appellant submitted that the High Court ought to have issued a writ of mandamus directing the Superintendent of Police, Barabanki to defer the arrest of the appellant until the collection of credible evidence sufficient for filing the charge-sheet, following the amended proviso to Section 41(1)(b) read with Section 41A Cr.P.C.

5. The Secretary, U.P. Secondary Education Board, Allahabad and the District School Inspector vide their letter dated 8.12.2011 registered a complaint alleging that the appellant had committed fraud and forgery in the matter of preparation of documents of Government Office regarding selection for the post of Assistant Teacher and, consequently, got appointment as the Assistant Teacher in Janpad Inter- College at Harakh, District Barabanki, with payment of salary amounting to Rs.1,10,000/- from the Government exchequer. On the basis of the FIR, Case Crime No. 797 of 2011 was registered under Sections 419/420 IPC before the Police Station, Jaizpur, District Barabanki. After having come to know of the registration of the crime, the appellant filed a representation on 27.12.2011 before the Superintendent of Police, District Barabanki and the Investigating Officer making the following prayer:

“As such through this application/representation the applicant prays that keeping in view the willingness of the applicant for cooperating in investigation and to appear before the investigating officer upon being called in case crime no. 797/11 u/Ss 419/420 IPC, PS Jaipdur, District Barabanki, order for staying the arrest of applicant be passed so that compliance to the provision 41(1)(B) Section 41(A) amended to CrPC 1973 be made.”
6. Since the appellant did not get any reply to the said representation, she invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by filing Writ Petition Misc. Bench No. 171 of 2012 which was dismissed, as already indicated, on 9.1.2012.

7. When the matter came up for hearing before this Court, it passed an interim order on 1.3.2013, the operative portion of which reads as under:

“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to direct that in the event of arrest of the petitioner, she shall be released on bail on furnishing personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court, subject to the condition that she will join investigation as and when required and shall abide by the provisions of Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
8. Shri Aseem Chandra, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that the High Court has committed an error in not quashing the FIR, since the registration of the crime was with mala fide intention to harass the appellant and in clear violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the appellant under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel submitted that the appellant was falsely implicated and that the ingredients of the offence under Sections 419/420 IPC were not prima facie made out for registering the crime. Learned counsel also pointed out that the High Court has not properly appreciated the scope of Sections 41(1)(b) and 41A CrPC, 1973 and that no attempt has been made to follow those statutory provisions by the State and its officials.

9. Shri Gaurav Bhatia, learned AAG, appearing for the State, submitted that the investigation was properly conducted and the crime was registered. Further, it was also pointed out that the President has also withheld the assent of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh Amendment) Bill, 2010, since the provisions of the Bill were found to be in contravention to Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. and hence the High Court rightly declined the stay sought for under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

10. Shri Siddharth Luthra, Additional Solicitor General, who appeared on our request, submitted that the High Court can in only rarest of rare cases grant pre-arrest bail while exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, since the provision for the grant of anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. was consciously omitted by the State Legislature. The legislative intention is, therefore, not to seek or provide pre-arrest bail when the FIR discloses a cognizable offence. Shri Luthra submitted that since there is a conscious withdrawal/deletion of Section 438 CrPC by the Legislature from the Code of Criminal Procedure, by Section 9 of the Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh) Amendment Act, 1976, the relief which otherwise the appellant could not have obtained under the Code, is sought to be obtained indirectly by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High Court, which is impermissible in law.

11. Shri Luthra also submitted that since the appellant has no legal right to move for anticipatory bail and that practice is not an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, the contention that the High Court has failed to examine the charges levelled against the appellant, was mala fide or violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, does not arise. Shri Luthra also submitted that the High Court was not correct in granting further reliefs after having dismissed the writ petition and that, only in extraordinary cases, the High Court could exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the case in hand does not fall in that category.

12. I may indicate that the legal issues raised in this case are no more res integra. All the same, it calls for a relook on certain aspects which I may deal with during the course of the judgment.

13. I am conscious of the fact that since the provisions similar to Section 438 Cr.P.C. being absent in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the High Court is burdened with large number of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking pre-arrest bail. Section 438 was added to the Code of Criminal Procedure in the year 1973, in pursuance to the recommendation made by the 41st Law Commission, but in the State of Uttar Pradesh by Section 9 Criminal Procedure (Uttar Pradesh) Amendment Act, 1976, Section 438 was specifically omitted, the legality of which came up for consideration before the Constitution Bench of this Court in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab (1994) 3 SCC 569 and the Court held that the deletion of the application of Section 438 in the State of Uttar Pradesh by Section 9 of the above mentioned Amendment Act does not offend either Article 14, Article 19 or Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the State Legislature is competent to delete that section, which is one of the matters enumerated in the concurrent list, and such a deletion is valid under Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India.

14. I notice, therefore, as per the Constitution Bench, a claim for pre-arrest protection is neither a statutory nor a right guaranteed under Article 14, Article 19 or Article 21 of the Constitution of India. All the same, in Karatar Singh’s case (supra), this Court in sub-para (17) of Para 368, has also stated as follows:

“368 xxx xxx xxx (17) Though it cannot be said that the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application for bail under Article 226 of the Constitution and pass orders either way, relating to the cases under the Act 1987, that power should be exercised sparingly, that too only in rare and appropriate cases in extreme circumstances. But the judicial discipline and comity of courts require that the High Courts should refrain from exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction in such matters;

xxx xxx xxx”

15. The High Court of Allahabad has also taken the same view in several judgments. Reference may be made to the judgments in Satya Pal v. State of U.P. (2000 Cri.L.J. 569), Ajeet Singh v. State of U.P. (2007 Cri.L.J. 170), Lalji Yadav & Others v. State of U.P. & Another (1998 Cri.L.J. 2366), Kamlesh Singh v. State of U.P. & Another (1997 Cri.L.J. 2705) and Natho Mal v. State of U.P. (1994 Cri.L.J. 1919).

16. We have, therefore, no concept of “anticipatory bail” as understood in Section 438 of the Code in the State of Uttar Pradesh. In Balchand Jain v. State of M.P. (1976) 4 SCC 572, this Court observed that “anticipatory bail” is a misnomer. Bail, by itself, cannot be claimed as a matter of right under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, except for bailable offences (Section 436 Cr.P.C., 1973). For non-bailable offences, conditions are prescribed under Sections 437 and 439 Cr.P.C. The discretion to grant bail in non- bailable offences remains with the Court and hence, it cannot be claimed as a matter of right, but the aggrieved party can only seek a remedy and it is on the discretion of the Court to grant it or not. In this connection reference may also be made to the Judgment of the seven-Judge Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Smt. Amarawati and Ors. V. State of U.P. (2005) Cri.L.J. 755, wherein the Court, while interpreting the provisions of Sections 41, 2(c) and 157(1) CrPC as well as the scope of Sections 437 and 439, held as follows:

“47. In view of the above we answer the questions referred to the Full Bench as follows:
(1) Even if cognizable offence is disclosed, in the FIR or complaint the arrest of the accused is not a must, rather the police officer should be guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P., 1994 Cr LJ 1981 before deciding whether to make an arrest or not.
(2) The High Court should ordinarily not direct any Subordinate Court to decide the bail application the same day, as that would be interfering with the judicial discretion of the Court hearing the bail application. However, as stated above, when the bail application is under Section 437 Cr.P.C. ordinarily the Magistrate should himself decide the bail application the same day, and if he decides in a rare and exceptional case not to decide it on the same day, he must record his reasons in writing. As regards the application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. it is in the discretion of the learned Sessions Judge considering the facts and circumstances whether to decide the bail application the same day or not, and it is also in his discretion to grant interim bail the same day subject to the final decision on the bail application later.
(3) The decision in Dr. Vinod Narain v. State of UP is incorrect and is substituted accordingly by this judgment.”
17. This Court in Lal Kamlendra Pratap Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others (2009) 4 SCC 437, while affirming the judgment in Amarawati (supra), held as follows:

“6. Learned counsel for the appellant apprehends that the appellant will be arrested as there is no provision for anticipatory bail in the State of U.P. He placed reliance on a decision of the Allahabad High Court in Amarawati v. State of U.P. in which a seven-Judge Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court held that the court, if it deems fit in the facts and circumstances of the case, may grant interim bail pending final disposal of the bail application. The Full Bench also observed that arrest is not a must whenever an FIR of a cognizable offence is lodged. The Full Bench placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. (1994) 4 SCC 260.
7. We fully agree with the view of the High Court in Amarawati case and we direct that the said decision be followed by all courts in U.P. in letter and spirit, particularly since the provision for anticipatory bail does not exist in U.P.
8. In appropriate cases interim bail should be granted pending disposal of the final bail application, since arrest and detention of a person can cause irreparable loss to a person’s reputation, as held by this Court in Joginder Kumar case. Also, arrest is not a must in all cases of cognizable offences, and in deciding whether to arrest or not the police officer must be guided and act according to the principles laid down in Joginder Kumar case.”
18. Later, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Som Mittal v. State of Karnataka (2008) 3 SCC 753, while dealing with an order of the Karnataka High Court under Section 482 CrPC, one of the Judges made some strong observations as well as recommendations to restore Section 438 in the State of U.P. Learned Judges constituting the Bench also expressed contrary views on certain legal issues, hence, the matter was later placed before a three-Judge Bench, the judgment of which is reported in same caption (2008) 3 SCC 574, wherein this Court opined that insofar as the observations, recommendations and directions in paras 17 to 39 of the concurrent judgment is concerned, they did not relate to the subject matter of the criminal appeal and the directions given were held to be obiter and were set aside.

19. I notice in this case FIR was lodged for offences, under Sections 419 and 420 IPC which carry a sentence of maximum of three years and seven years respectively with or without fine. Benefit of Section 41(a) Cr.P.C. must be available in a given case, which provides that an investigating officer shall not arrest the accused of such offences in a routine manner and the arrest be made, only after following the restrictions imposed under Section 41(b). The relevant provisions, as it stands now reads as follow:

“41. When police may arrest without warrant.- (1) Any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person –
a) who commits, in the presence of a police officer, a cognizable offence;
b) against whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years or which may extend to seven years whether with or without fine, if the following conditions are satisfied, namely:-
i) the police officer has reason to believe on the basis of such complaint, information, or suspicion that such person has committed the said offence;
ii) the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is necessary –
a) to prevent such person from committing any further offence; or
b) for proper investigation of the offence; or
c) to prevent such person from causing the evidence of the offence to disappear or tampering with such evidence in any manner, or
d) to prevent such person from making any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to the police officer; or
e) as unless such person is arrested, his presence in the Court whenever required cannot be ensured, and the police officer shall record while making such arrest, his reasons in writing:
Provided that a police officer shall, in all cases where the arrest of a person is not required under the provisions of this sub-section; record the reasons in writing for not making the arrest.”
20. Amended provisions make it compulsory for the police to record the reasons for making arrest as well as for not making an arrest in respect of a cognizable offence for which the maximum sentence is upto seven years. Reference in this connection may also be made to Section 41A inserted vide Act 5 of 2009 w.e.f. 01.11.2010, which reads as follows:

“41A. Notice of appearance before police officer – (1) The police officer shall, in all cases where the arrest of a person is not required under the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 41, issue a notice directing the person against whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable offence, to appear before him or at such other place as may be specified in the notice.
(2) Where such a notice is issued to any person, it shall be the duty of that person to comply with the terms of the notice.
(3) Where such person complies and continues to comply with the notice, he shall not be arrested in respect of the offence referred to in the notice unless, for reasons to be recorded, the police officer is of the opinion that he ought to be arrested.
(4) Where such person, at any time, fails to comply with the terms of the notice or is unwilling to identify himself, the police officer may, subject to such orders as may have been passed by a competent Court in this behalf, arrest him for the offence mentioned in the notice.”
21. Above mentioned provisions make it compulsory for the police to issue a notice in all such cases where arrest is not required to be made under Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of the amended Section 41. But, all the same, unwillingness of a person who has not been arrested to identify himself and to whom a notice has been issued under Section 41A, could be a ground for his arrest. Legislation has laid down various parameters, warranting arrest of a person, which itself is a check on arbitrary or unwarranted arrest and the right to personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

22. I may, however, point out that there is unanimity in the view that in spite of the fact that Section 438 has been specifically omitted and made inapplicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh, still a party aggrieved can invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, being extraordinary jurisdiction and the vastness of the powers naturally impose considerable responsibility in its application. All the same, the High Court has got the power and sometimes duty in appropriate cases to grant reliefs, though it is not possible to pin-point what are the appropriate cases, which have to be left to the wisdom of the Court exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

23. I am also faced with the situation that on dismissal of the writ by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, while examining the challenge for quashing the FIR or a charge-sheet, whether the High Court could grant further relief against arrest for a specific period or till the completion of the trial. This Court in State of Orissa v. Madan Gopal Rungta reported in AIR 1952 SC 12, while dealing with the scope of Article 226 of the Constitution, held as follows :-

“Article 226 cannot be used for the purpose of giving interim relief as the only and final relief on the application. The directions had been given here only to circumvent the provisions of Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, and that was not within the scope of Article 226. An interim relief can be granted only in aid of and as ancillary to the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceeding. If the Court was of opinion that there was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners, it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners succeeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature; and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the status quo ante. But when the Court declined to decide on the rights of the parties and expressly held that they should be investigated more properly in a civil suit, it could not, for the purpose of facilitating the institution of such suit, issue directions in the nature of temporary injunctions, under Article 226 of the Constitution. The language of Article 226 does not permit such an action.”
24. The language of Article 226 does not permit such an action and once the Court finds no merits in the challenge, writ petition will have to be dismissed and the question of granting further relief after dismissal of the writ, does not arise. Consequently, once a writ is dismissed, all the interim reliefs granted would also go.

25. This Court has already passed an interim order on 1.3.2013 granting bail to the appellant on certain conditions. The said order will continue till the completion of the trial. However, if the appellant is not co-operating with the investigation, the State can always move for vacating the order. The appeal is accordingly dismissed as above.

(K. S. Radhakrishnan) New Delhi, January 16, 2014.

[REPORTABLE] IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 146/2014 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 7439/2013) Km. Hema Mishra …..Appellant Vs.

State of U.P. & Ors.

….Respondents J U D G M E N T A.K.SIKRI,J.

1. I have carefully gone through the judgment authored by my esteemed brother, Justice Radhakrishnan. I entirely agree with the conclusions arrived at by my learned brother in the said judgment. At the same time, I would also like to make some observations pertaining to the powers of High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to grant relief against pre-arrest (commonly called as anticipatory bail), even when Section 438,Cr.P.C. authorizing the Court to grant such a relief is specifically omitted and made inapplicable in so far as State of Uttar Pradesh is concerned. I would like to start with reproducing the following observations in the opinion of my brother, on this aspect which are contained in paragraph 21 of the judgment. It reads as under:

“We may, however, point out that there is unanimity in the view that in spite of the fact that Section 438 has been specifically omitted and made inapplicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh, still a party aggrieved can invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, being extraordinary jurisdiction and the vastness of the powers naturally impose considerable responsibility in its application. All the same, the High Court has got the power and sometimes duty in appropriate cases to grant reliefs, though it is not possible to pin-point what are the appropriate cases, which we have to leave to the wisdom of the Court exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.”
2. Another aspect which is highlighted in the judgment rendered by Justice Radhakrishnan is that many times in the Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking quashing of the FIR or the charge-sheet, the petitioners pray for interim relief against arrest. While entertaining the Writ Petition the High Court invariably grants such an interim relief. It is rightly pointed out that once the Writ Petition claiming main relief for quashing of FIR or the charge-sheet itself is dismissed, the question of granting further relief after dismissal of the Writ Petition, does not arise. It is so explained in para 22 and 23 of the judgment of my learned brother.

3. I would like to remark that in the absence of any provisions like Section 438 of Cr.P.C. applicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh, there is a tendency on the part of the accused persons, against whom FIR is lodged and/or charge-sheet is filed in the Court to file Writ Petition for quashing of those proceedings so that they are able to get protection against the arrest in the interregnum which is the primary motive for filing such petitions. It is for this reason that invariably after the lodging of FIR, Writ Petition under Article 226 is filed with main prayer to quash those proceedings and to claim interim relief against pre-arrest in the meantime or till the completion of the trial. However, the considerations which have to weigh with the High Court to decide as to whether such proceedings are to be quashed or not are entirely different than that of granting interim protection against the arrest. Since the grounds on which such an FIR or charge sheet can be quashed are limited, once the Writ Petition challenging the validity of FIR or charge-sheet is dismissed, the grant of relief, incidental in nature, against arrest would obviously not arise, even when a justifiable case for grant of anticipatory bail is made out .

4. It is for this reason, we are of the opinion that in appropriate cases the High Court is empowered to entertain the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India where the main relief itself is against arrest. Obviously, when provisions of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. are not available to the accused persons in the State of Uttar Pradesh, under the normal circumstances such an accused persons would not be entitled to claim such a relief under Art. 226 of the Constitution. It cannot be converted into a second window for the relief which is consciously denied statutorily making it a case of casus omissus. At the same time, as rightly observed in para 21 extracted above, the High Court cannot be completely denuded of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, to grant such a relief in appropriate and deserving cases; albeit this power is to be exercised with extreme caution and sparingly in those cases where arrest of a person would lead to total miscarriage of justice. There may be cases where pre-arrest may be entirely unwarranted and lead to disastrous consequences. Whenever the High Court is convinced of such a situation, it would be appropriate to grant the relief against pre-arrest in such cases. What would be those cases will have to be left to the wisdom of the High Court. What is emphasized is that the High Court is not bereft of its powers to grant this relief under Art. 226 of the Constitution.

A Bench of this Court, headed by the then Chief Justice Y.V.Chandrachud, laid down first principles of granting anticipatory bail in the Gurbaksh Singh v. State of Punjab 1980 Crl.L.J. 417 (P&H), reemphasizing that liberty… - ‘A person who has yet to lose his freedom by being arrested asks for freedom in the event of arrest. That is the stage at which it is imperative to protect his freedom, in so far as one may, and to give full play to the presumption that he is innocent.

5. In Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. and Others, 1994 Cr L.J. 1981, the Supreme Court observed:

“No arrest can be made because it is lawful for the police officer to do so. The existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another. The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his power to do so. Arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self esteem of a person. No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere allegation of commission of an offence made against a person. It would be prudent for a police officer in the interest of protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and perhaps in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the genuineness of a complaint and a reasonable belief both as to the person’s complicity and even so as to the need to effect arrest.”
6. It is pertinent to explain there may be imminent need to grant protection against pre-arrest. The object of this provision is to relieve a person from being disgraced by trumped up charges so that liberty of the subject is not put in jeopardy on frivolous grounds at the instance of the unscrupulous or irresponsible persons who may be in charge of the prosecution. An order of anticipatory bail does not in any way, directly or indirectly; take away for the police their right to investigate into charges made or to be made against the person released on bail.

7. The purposes for which the provisions of anticipatory bail are made are quite obvious. One of the purposes of the arrest is that the accused should be available to the investigating machinery for further investigation and questioning whenever he is required. Another purpose is that the trial should not be jeopardized and for this purpose the restrictions on the movements of the accused are necessary. The genuineness of the alleged need for police custody has to be examined and it must be balanced against the duty of courts to uphold the dignity of every man and to vigilantly guard the right to liberty without jeopardizing the state objective of maintenance of law and order.

8. I would also like to reproduce certain paragraphs from Kartar Singh and Ors. V. State of Punjab (1994) 3 SCC 569, wherein Justice K.Ramaswamy, speaking for the Court, discussed the importance of life and liberty in the following words.

“The foundation of Indian political and social democracy, as envisioned in the preamble of the Constitution, rests on justice, equality, liberty and fraternity in secular and socialist republic in which every individual has equal opportunity to strive towards excellence and of his dignity of person in an integrated egalitarian Bharat. Right to justice and equality and stated liberties which include freedom of expression, belief and movement are the means for excellence. The right to life with human dignity of person is a fundamental right of every citizen for pursuit of happiness and excellence. Personal freedom is a basic condition for full development of human personality. Art.21 of the Constitution protects right to life which is the most precious right in a civilized society. The trinity i.e. liberty, equality and fraternity always blossoms and enlivens the flower of human dignity. One of the gifts of democracy to mankind is the right to personal liberty. Life and personal freedom are the prized jewels under Art.19 conjointly assured by Art.20(3), 21 and 22 of the Constitution and Art.19 ensures freedom of movement. Liberty aims at freedom not only from arbitrary restraint but also to secure such conditions which are essential for the full development of human personality. Liberty is the essential concomitant for other rights without which a man cannot be at his best. The essence of all civil liberties is to keep alive the freedom of the individual subject to the limitations of social control envisaged in diverse articles in the chapter of Fundamental Rights Part III in harmony with social good envisaged in the Directive Principles in Part IV of the Constitution. Freedom cannot last long unless it is coupled with order. Freedom can never exist without order. Freedom and order may coexist. It is essential that freedom should be exercised under authority and order should be enforced by authority which is vested solely in the executive. Fundamental rights are the means and directive principles are essential ends in a welfare State. The evolution of the State from police State to a welfare State is the ultimate measure and accepted standard of democratic society which is an avowed constitutional mandate. Though one of the main functions of the democratic Government is to safeguard liberty of the individual, unless its exercise is subject to social control, it becomes anti-social or undermines the security of the State. The Indian democracy wedded to rule of law aims not only to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens but also to establish an egalitarian social order. The individual has to grow within the social confines preventing his unsocial or unbridled growth which could be done by reconciling individual liberty with social control. Liberty must be controlled in the interest of the society but the social interest must never be overbearing to justify total deprivation of individual liberty. Liberty cannot stand alone but must be paired with a companion virtue; liberty and morality; liberty and law; liberty and justice; liberty and common good; liberty and responsibility which are concomitants for orderly progress and social stability. Man being a rational individual has to life in harmony with equal rights of others and more differently for the attainment of antithetic desires. This intertwined network is difficult to delineate within defined spheres of conduct within which freedom of action may be confined. Therefore, liberty would not always be an absolute license but must arm itself within the confines of law. In other words, here can be no liberty without social restraint. Liberty, therefore, as a social conception is a right to be assured to all members of a society. Unless restraint is enforced on and accepted by all members of the society, the liberty of some must involve the oppression of others. If liberty be regarded a social order, the problem of establishing liberty must be a problem of organizing restraint which society controls over the individual. Therefore, liberty of each citizen is borne of and must be subordinated to the liberty of the greatest number, in other words common happiness as an end of the society, lest lawlessness and anarchy will tamper social weal and harmony and powerful courses or forces would be at work to undermine social welfare and order. Thus the essence of civil liberty is to keep alive the freedom of the individual subject to the limitation of social control which could be adjusted according to the needs of the dynamic social evolution.

The modem social evolution is the growing need to keep individual to be as free as possible, consistent with his correlative obligation to the society. According to Dr. Ambedkar in his closing speech in the Constituent Assembly, the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate entities but in a trinity. They form the union or trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality. Equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can equality and liberty be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce supremacy of law. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality would not become a natural course of things. Courts, as sentinel on the qui vive, therefore, must strike a balance between the changing needs of the society for peaceful transformation with orders and protection of the rights of the citizen.(Para 374)

9. It was also held in that judgment that the High Courts under Art.226 had the right to entertain writ petitions for quashing of FIR and granting of interim protection from arrest. This position, in the context of contours of Art.226, is stated as follows in the same judgment:

“From this scenario, the question emerges whether the High Court under Art.226 would be right in entertaining proceedings to quash the charge-sheet or to grant bail to a person accused of an offence under the Act or other offences committed during the course of the same transaction exclusively triable by the Designated Court. Nothing is more striking than the failure of law to evolve a consistent jurisdictional doctrine or even elementary principles, if it is subject to conflicting or inconceivable or inconsistent result which lead to uncertainty, incongruity and disbelief in the efficacy of law. The jurisdiction and power of the High Court under Art.226 of the Constitution is undoubtedly constituent power and the High Court has untrammeled powers and jurisdiction to issue any writ or order or direction to any person or authority within its territorial jurisdiction for enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or for any other purpose. The legislature has no power to divest the court of the constituent power engrafted under Art.226. A superior court is deemed to have general jurisdiction and the law presumes that the court has acted within its jurisdiction. This presumption is denied to the inferior courts. The judgment of a superior court unreservedly is conclusive as to all relevant matters thereby decided, while the judgment of the inferior court involving a question of jurisdiction is not final. The superior court, therefore, has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction, may be rightly or wrongly. Therefore, the court in an appropriate proceeding may erroneously exercise jurisdiction. It does not constitute want of jurisdiction, but it impinges upon its propriety in the exercise of the jurisdiction. Want of jurisdiction can be established solely by a superior court and that in practice no decision can be impeached collaterally by an inferior court. However, acts done by a superior court are always deemed valid wherever they are relied upon. The exclusion thereof from the rule of validity is indispensable in its finality. The superior courts, therefore, are the final arbiters of the validity of the acts done not only by other inferior courts or authorities, but also their own decisions. Though they are immune from collateral attack, but to avoid confusion the superior court’s decisions lay down the rules of validity; are not governed by those rules. The valid decision is not only conclusive, it may affect, but it is also conclusive in proceedings where it is sought to be collaterally impeached. However, the term conclusiveness may acquire other specific meanings. It may mean that the finding upon which the decision is founded as distinct or it is the operative part or has to be conclusive or these findings bind only parties on litigated disputes or that the organ which has made the decision is itself precluded from revoking, rescinding or otherwise altering it.”
10. It would be pertinent to mention here that in light of above mentioned statements and cases, the High Court would not be incorrect or acting out of jurisdiction if it exercises its power under Art.226 to issue appropriate writ or direction or order in exceptional cases at the behest of a person accused of an offence triable under the Act or offence jointly triable with the offences under the Act.

11. It is pertinent to mention that though the High Courts have very wide powers under Art.226, the very vastness of the powers imposes on it the responsibility to use them with circumspection and in accordance with the judicial consideration and well established principles, so much so that while entertaining writ petitions for granting interim protection from arrest, the Court would not go on to the extent of including the provision of anticipatory bail as a blanket",0
M/s Mamta Surgical,"These appeals are directed against the common judgment and order passed by the High Court of Rajasthan in S.B. Civil Sales Tax Revision No. 932 of 2002 and connected matters, dated 23.01.2003. By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has opined that “surgical cotton” is a commercially different commodity from ‘cotton’ and accordingly confirmed the order passed by the Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer in Appeal Nos. 509 to 512 of 2001, dated 28.06.2002.

Facts:

2. The appellant is a partnership firm registered as a dealer both under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 (for short, ""the Act”) and the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for short, “the CST Act”). The appellant carries on the business of processing the cotton and transforming it into surgical cotton.

3. The assessment years in question are 1992-93 to 1998-99. The assessee purchases cotton after paying tax at the rate of 4% and thereafter process it into surgical cotton for sale.

4. For the relevant assessment years, the assessing authority had conducted a survey on the business premises of the assessee and opined that surgical cotton produced and sold by the assessee is a separate commercial commodity from cotton and thus liable to be taxed at 4% under the Act. Accordingly, a show cause notice was issued to the assessee. The assessee took the stand that cotton and surgical cotton are not distinct commodities for the purposes of levy of tax under the Act. The said stand of the assessee was rejected by the Assessing Authority which passed an order of assessment whereby the assessee was taxed at the rate of 4% and the penalty and interest thereon, dated 28.03.2000.

5. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of assessment, the assessee had carried the matter by way of an appeal before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) Commercial Tax, Ajmer. The said authority, accepted the stand of the assessee that the process adopted for making surgical cotton out of cotton purchased does not bring into existence a new commercial commodity and that surgical cotton is nothing but another form of cotton and accordingly, allowed the appeal and granted the relief to the assessee by order dated 10.10.2000.

6. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed by the First Appellate Authority, the Revenue had carried the matter before the Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer (for short, “the Board”). The Board after considering the meaning of the expression 'manufacture' as defined under the Act and also placing reliance on the observations made by this Court in various decisions has come to the conclusion that the surgical cotton manufactured by the assessee is a new commercial commodity exigible to tax separately at the rate of 4% under the Act and therefore, set aside the orders passed by the First Appellate Authority and restored the orders passed by the assessing authority for the assessment years in question by order dated 28.06.2002.

7. The assessee being aggrieved by the said order passed by the Board had approached the High Court in S.B. Civil Sales Tax Revision No. 932 of 2002. The High Court has noticed Entry 16 of the notification F.4 (7) FD/Gr.IV/92-70 (S.O. No. 993), dated 04.03.1992 for the assessment year 1992-93 and analysed the submissions of parties to the lis and thereafter reached the conclusion that surgical cotton is amenable to be taxed as an independent entity and accordingly, rejected the tax revision cases and confirmed the orders passed by the Tax Board by the impugned judgment and order dated 23.01.2003.

8. It is the correctness or otherwise of the said judgment and order is the subject matter of these appeals.

9. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties to the lis. We have also perused the documents on record including the judgments and orders passed by the Courts below.

Submissions:

10. Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that by the process of transformation of cotton into surgical cotton no new commercial commodity comes into existence as a result of such process, and therefore it cannot be considered as “manufacture” of surgical cotton from cotton and thus would not be liable to tax at the rate of 4% under the Act. He would place reliance on the decision of this Court in CST v. Lal Kunwa Stone Crusher (P) Ltd., (2000) 3 SCC 525, to bring home the point, that, since the purpose of sales tax is to levy tax on sale of goods of each variety and not the sale of the raw material of which they may have been made and therefore, where commercial goods are merely subjected to some processing, they may remain commercially the same goods which cannot be taxed again in a series of sales so long as they continue to retain their identity as goods of that particular variety. He would further explain the term “manufacture” in context of the Act and draw support from the decisions of this Court in, inter alia, Sterling Foods v. State of Karnataka, (1986) 3 SCC 469 and CST v. Pio Food Packers, 1980 Supp SCC 174 and submit that that the essential feature of “manufacturing” is the utilization of original commodity and its transformation into a different commodity wherein the original article stands distinguished from the end product as an entirely different commodity and since the aforesaid is not the case herein, the process of transformation of cotton into surgical cotton would not be a manufacture for the levy of tax under the Act and therefore, the High Court has erroneously dismissed the case of appellants confirming the levy of tax on surgical cotton under the Act. Alternatively, he would submit that even if surgical cotton is assumed to be a distinct commodity from cotton, the originally purchased raw cotton has already suffered taxation at the outset and therefore, a set off has to be provided in light of the scheme of the Act and the CST Act.

11. Per contra, learned counsel for the Revenue would support the judgment and order passed by the High Court.

13. The question which arises for our consideration and decision in these appeals is whether the manufacturing process is involved in the production of surgical cotton from cotton in terms of definition mentioned in Section 2(27) of the Act and whether the same commodity in the same entry would be liable for taxation twice specially when the scheme of Act suggests that cotton is a commodity of special importance and must be taxed only once in terms of Section 15 of the CST Act. Since the relevant entry has been amended vide successive notifications for each Assessment Year, we would analyse it sequentially.

Assessment Year 1992-93

14. For the Assessment Year 1992-93, Entry 16 as reproduced above prescribes that cotton of all kinds whether indigenous or imported and whether ginned or unginned, baled, pressed or otherwise including cotton waste is covered by this entry. This is a comprehensive inclusion of all kinds of cotton for the purposes of taxing. A reading of this entry means that the commodity cotton in all its forms namely, indigenous, imported, ginned, unginned, baled, pressed, non-pressed is liable to be taxed at the rate of 4% alongwith cotton waste. Since neither does “surgical cotton” find mention in the aforesaid entry as a commodity nor does it suitably fit into the description aforesaid, it becomes relevant to delve into the question whether the commodity in question has undergone any change in its characteristics so as to acquire a new commercial identity, that is to say, whether surgical cotton remain as cotton after having undergone transformation through various processes. In other words whether the process of conversion of cotton into surgical cotton be termed as “manufacture of surgical cotton”.

15. It is therefore relevant to notice the definition of 'manufacture' as defined in the dictionary clause of the Act. Section 2(27) of the Act defines the expression 'manufacture' as under:

""27. ""Manufacture"" includes every processing of goods which bring into existence a commercially different and distinct commodity but shall not include such processing as may be notified by the State Government.""
The definition aforesaid is an inclusive definition and therefore would encompass all processing of goods which would produce new commodity which is commercially different and distinctly identifiable from the original goods. The definition however excludes all such mechanisms of processing of goods which have been notified by the State Government to the said effect. Admittedly, no such exclusion in respect of the process in analysis for surgical cotton has been notified by the State Government. Therefore, the process of transformation has to be tested on the anvil of proposition whether surgical cotton is processed such that it is commercially different and distinctly identifiable than cotton.

16. The essential test for determining whether a process is manufacture or not has been the analysis of the end product of such process in contradistinction with the original raw material. In 1906, Darling, J. had subtly explained the quintessence of the expression “manufacture” in McNichol and Anor v. Pinch, [1906] 2 KB 352 as under:

“…I think the essence of making or of manufacturing is that what is made shall be a different thing from that out of which it is made.”
17. In order to understand the finer connotation of the expression 'manufacture', it may be useful to refer to the decision of this Court in the case of Empire Industries Limited and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.,(1985) 2 SCC 314, wherein this Court after exhaustively noticing the views of the Indian Courts, Privy Council and this Court had stated as under:

""'Manufacture' implies a change, but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment, labour and manipulation. But something more is necessary and there must be transformation; a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name, character or use. ""

Commr. of Customs & Central Excise, (2007) 4 SCC 155; CIT v. Tara Agencies, (2007) 6 SCC 429; Ujagar Prints (II) v. Union of India, 1986 Supp SCC 652; Saraswati Sugar Mills v.

State of U.P., (2001) 3 SCC 135)

18. The following observations by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd., 1963 Supp (1) SCR 586 where the change in the character of raw oil after being refined fell for consideration are also quite apposite:

“14. … The word ‘manufacture’ used as a verb is generally understood to mean as ‘bringing into existence a new substance’ and does not mean merely ‘to produce some change in a substance.’”
19. For determining whether a process is “manufacture” or not, this Court in Union of India v. J.G. Glass Industries Ltd., (1998) 2 SCC 32 has laid down a two-pronged test. Firstly, whether by such process a different commercial commodity comes into existence or whether the identity of the original commodity ceases to exist and secondly, whether the commodity which was already in existence would serve no purpose but for the said process. In light of the said test it was held that printing on bottles does not amount to manufacture.

20. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Devi Das Gopal Krishnan v. State of Punjab, (1967) 3 SCR 557 observed that if by a process a different identity comes into existence then it can be said to be “manufacture” and therefore, when oil is produced out of the seeds the process certainly transforms raw material into different article for use.

21. In CCE v. S.R. Tissues (P) Ltd., (2005) 6 SCC 310, the issue for consideration was whether the process of unwinding, cutting and slitting to sizes of jumbo rolls into toilet rolls, napkins and facial tissue papers amounted to manufacture. While holding that the said process did not amount to manufacture this Court inter alia, held as under:

“12. … However, the end use of the tissue paper in the jumbo rolls and the end use of the toilet rolls, the table napkins and the facial tissues remains the same, namely, for household or sanitary use. The predominant test in such a case is whether the characteristics of the tissue paper in the jumbo roll enumerated above is different from the characteristics of the tissue paper in the form of table napkin, toilet roll and facial tissue. In the present case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the characteristics of the tissue paper in the jumbo roll are not different from the characteristics of the tissue paper, after slitting and cutting, in the table napkins, in the toilet rolls and in the facial tissues.” (emphasis supplied)
22. At this stage the discussion of difference between “processing” and “manufacture” holds much relevance to well appreciate the contention canvassed by Shri Giri that the transformation of cotton into surgical cotton would be mere processing and not manufacture.

23. According to Oxford English Dictionary one of the meanings of the word “process” is “a continuous and regular action or succession of actions taking place or carried on in a definite manner and leading to the accomplishment of some result”. In Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, the term “process” has been defined as “1. a series of operations performed during manufacture, etc. 2. a series of stages which a product, etc. passes through, resulting in the development or transformation of it.”

24. In East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Frozen Food Express, 351 US 49 the Supreme Court of United States of America has held that the processing of chicken in order to make them marketable but without changing their substantial identity did not turn chicken from agriculture commodities into manufactured commodities.

25. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Pio Food Packers case (supra) has dealt with the distinction between “manufacture” and “processing”. Therein the appeals were filed against the order of the Kerala High Court holding that the turnover of pineapple fruits purchased for preparing pineapple slices for sale in sealed cans is not covered by Section 5- A(1)(a) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963. This Court while deciding whether such conversion of pineapple fruit into pineapple slices for sale in sealed cans amounted to manufacture or not has observed as follows:

“5. … Commonly, manufacture is the end result of one [or] more processes through which the original commodity is made to pass. The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another, and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps a different kind of processing at each stage. With each process suffered, the original commodity experiences a change. But it is only when the change, or a series of changes, take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to take place. Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another. Although it has undergone a degree of processing, it must be regarded as still retaining its original identity.” (emphasis supplied) This Court held that when the pineapple fruit is processed into pineapple slices for the purpose of being sold in sealed cans, there is no consumption of the original pineapple fruit for the purpose of manufacture.
Pineapple retains its character as fruit and whether canned or fresh, it could be put to the same use and utilized in similar fashion.

26. In Sterling Foods case (supra) this Court has observed that processed and frozen shrimps, prawns and lobsters cannot be regarded as commercially distinct commodity from raw shrimps, prawns and lobsters. The aforesaid view has further been adopted and applied by this Court in Shyam Oil Cake Ltd. case (supra) wherein the classification of refined edible oil after refining was under consideration and on similar lines it was held that the process of refining of raw edible vegetable oil did not amount to manufacture. In Aman Marble Industries case (supra), this Court has held that the cutting of marble blocks into smaller pieces would not be a process of manufacture for the reason that no new and distinct commercial product came into existence as the end product still remained the same and thus its original identity continued.

27. This Court in Crane Betel Nut Powder Works case (supra) citing the earlier decision in Brakes India Ltd. v. Supdt. of Central Excise, (1997) 10 SCC 717 wherein the process of drilling, trimming and chamfering was said to amount to “manufacture”, has reiterated that if by a process, a change is effected in a product and new characteristic is introduced which facilitates the utility of the new product for which it is meant, then the process is not a simple process, but a process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product. In Kores India Ltd. v. CCE, (2005) 1 SCC 385 the cutting of duty-paid typewriter/telex ribbons in jumbo rolls into standard predetermined lengths was considered by this Court and it was held that such cutting brought into existence a commercial product having distinct name, character and use and amounted to “manufacture” and attracted the liability to duty. In Standard Fireworks Industries v. Collector of Central Excise, (1987) 1 SCC 600 this Court held that cutting of steel wires and the treatment of paper is a process for the manufacture of goods in question.

28. In Lal Kunwa Stone Crusher case (supra), the decision relied upon by Shri Giri, this Court has considered that whether on crushing stone boulders into gitti, stone chips and dust different commercial goods emerge so as to amount to manufacture as per the definition of “manufacture” under Section 2(e-1) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 and observed that even if gitti, kankar, stone ballast, etc. may all be looked upon as separate in commercial character from stone boulders offered for sale in the market, “stone” as under the relevant Entry is wide enough to include the various forms such as gitti, kankar, stone ballast. It is in this light, that the Court had opined that stone gitti, chips, etc. continue to be identifiable with the stone boulders.

29. Having noticed the relevant Entries, the definition of 'manufacture' and judicial precedents, we would now notice, (a) the process adopted by the assessee for the purpose of converting raw cotton into surgical cotton and (b) the utility and commercial use of surgical cotton in contrast to cotton.

Process of conversion of cotton into surgical cotton

30. The Project report on Surgical Absorbent Cotton, December 2010 (pg. 3 and 4) prepared by MSME - Development Institute, Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Government of India provides for the following steps in manufacture of surgical cotton:

“a) Opening and cleaning of Raw Cotton:
Raw cotton received in bale or otherwise is opened in opener where it is loosened and simultaneously dust/foreign particles are also removed. Loosened cotton is then put into a keir where chemicals such as caustic soda, soda ash, detergent, etc. are added along with adequate water and steam boiled for about 3-4 hours. By this process most of the natural waxes and oils are removed while remaining foreign matter get soften and disintegrated. The treated cotton is transferred to washing tanks where it is washed thoroughly.
b) Bleaching:
Washed cotton is bleached to remove brownish colour developed due to chemical treatment. Bleaching is done by using bleaching agent such as sodium-hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide. The bleaching process improves whiteness, wetting properties and assists in disintegration of any remaining foreign materials.
c) Removal of Chemicals:
The bleached cotton is thoroughly washed again to remove the chemicals. A little quantity of dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid is also added to neutralize excess alkali. If required, again washed with water. The water of cotton is removed with the help of hydro-extractor. It is then sent to a wet-cotton opening machine.
d) Drying:
The cotton so obtained is dried by passing through dryer or alternatively subjected to sun drying where provision for dryer is not there.
e) Lapping:
The dried cotton is sent to blower room where it is thoroughly opened and made into laps.
f) Carding:
The laps are then fed into carding machine wherein cotton is warped around rollers in thin layers.
g) Rolling:
Cotton so obtained is compressed and rolled into suitable role size along with packaging paper.
h) Weighing and cutting:
The rolls are then weighed and cut according to required weight and sizes and labeled properly before packing in polythene sheets and heat sealed.”
31. The admitted facts are the assessee purchases raw cotton by paying tax at the rate of 4 per cent. After such purchase, after ginning the cotton is put into boiler and its roughage is separated from cotton. The clean cotton thereafter is treated with caustic soda and acid slurry. After such treatment with the aforesaid chemicals, the cotton is cut in small pieces. These pieces are transferred to a tank where bleaching process takes place. Such bleached cotton is then transferred into tanks for washing. As noticed by the High Court, the cotton passed from four stages from raw cotton upto surgical cotton. First, it is put into tanks for washing each step takes sufficient time. Second, the treated cotton is transferred to a process known as hydro process where it is dried. Third, the cotton is put in the blower for cleaning the same. Fourth, such blowed out cotton is thereafter transferred to kler where rolls are prepared and then cotton is cut into pieces with the desired level, width and size. The process does not end here. The rolled out calibrated pieces of cotton are then put in carding machine where thin layers are framed and such layers are packed in bundle for marketing. The rolled and compressed cotton is sent for trading.

Utility and Commercial use:

32. The aforesaid view is further fortified by the common parlance test. It can be said when a consumer requires surgical cotton, he would not be satisfied with cotton being provided to him and the same principle would reversibly apply that a customer of cotton would not use surgical cotton as a substitute. Further the purposes for which cotton and surgical cotton are used are diametrically opposite. While surgical cotton finds utility primarily for medical purposes in households, dispensaries, hospitals, etc, raw cotton being, inter alia, non-sterlised and riddled with organic impurities cannot be used as such at all.

33. For both these commodities operational territories are different and both have a different consumer segments. For medical and pharmaceutical purposes, use of ordinary cotton is not permissible. The fixed medical standards for the quality of surgical cotton are definite and definable such that ordinary cotton would not suffice the purpose. Surgical cotton is only used in form of medicine or pharmaceutical product, thus it cannot be said that use of commodity is interchangeable and in that view of the matter, surgical cotton is a different commodity. It is a commodity which is used with a completely distinct identity in itself. As what is used for medical purpose is perfectly sterilized disinfected purified cotton. If raw cotton is used for surgical purposes, it would be counter-productive. Surgical cotton is extensively used for making napkins, sanitary pads and filters, etc. The surgical cotton is exclusively consumed into medical field while ordinary cotton has so many uses. The main chemical properties desired in a surgical dressing are inertness and lack of irritation in use, which is provided by the surgical cotton only if manufactured as per the standards specified. Raw cotton is purified by a series of processes and rendered hydrophilic in character and free from other external organic impurities for use in surgical dressings. Surgical cotton is, thus, completely different from ordinary cotton.

34. The surgical cotton is made sterile and fit for surgical use and it is not put to the same use to which the unmanufactured cotton is put and vice versa. Therefore, when unmanufactured cotton undergoes a manufacturing process, a new product saleable into the market which is having a distinct identity, comes into existence which is known in the commercial market by a different name and use. Surgical cotton possesses higher utility than the cotton in its un-manufactured state.

35. It is trite to state that “manufacture” can be said to have taken place only when there is transformation of raw materials into a new and different article having a different identity, characteristic and use. While mere improvement in quality does not amount to manufacture, when the change or a series of changes transform the commodity such that commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but recognised as a new and distinct article. In the instant case, after going through the various steps that are carried out by the assessee for getting surgical cotton from raw cotton, we can certainly say that cotton has undergone a change into a new commercially identifiable commodity which has a different name, different character and different use. The process of transformation is not merely processing to improve quality or superficial attributes of the raw cotton. The cotton looses its original form and it marketed as a commercially different and distinct product. This aspect of the matter is rightly noticed by the High Court by relying upon the decision of this Court in Empire Industries case (supra) wherein this Court has explained the meaning of the expression 'manufacture"" as when the result of the treatment, labour and manipulation a new commercial commodity has emerged which has a distinctive new character and use.

36. Having carefully observed the process of transformation of raw cotton into surgical cotton and having noticed that there is distinctive name, character and use of the new commodity, i.e., surgical cotton, we are of the considered opinion that surgical cotton is a separately identifiable and distinct commercial commodity manufactured out of raw cotton and therefore, ceases to be cotton under Entry 16 of the said notification.

37. The second limb of Shri Giri’s contention that under the scheme of the Act and the CST Act, since tax has already been paid once on the original commodity, i.e., raw cotton, the appellants would be entitled to claim set-off for the manufactured surgical cotton fails to impress us. The High Court has noticed that the said question was not raised before the original assessing authority and consequently, the authorities below have not considered the said question and such being the case, the High Court has declined to consider the same. In our considered opinion, the said question cannot be considered by us for the first time in these appeals and thus, the conclusion of the High Court in this regard stands affirmed. However, the appellant is at liberty to raise the said question before the appropriate authorities in accordance with law.

38. In view of the above, we cannot take any exception to the impugned judgment and order passed by the High court in so far as the Assessment Year 1992-93 is concerned.

Assessment Years 1993-94 to 1998-99:

39. We would now proceed to examine the claim of the assessee for the Assessment Years 1993-94 to 1999-2000. The Entry for the relevant years is reproduced in the preceding paragraph no. 12.

40. In the year 1993, by an amendment notification F.4 (56) FD/Gr.IV/82- 2 (S.O. No. 8) dated 12.04.1993, the legislature has consciously included “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” immediately after the words “cotton waste” in Entry 16. By the notification dated 07.03.1994, for the Assessment Year 1994-95, the entry stands as “Cotton, that is to say, all kinds of cotton (indigenous or imported), kinds of readymade garments, whether ginned or unginned, baled, pressed or otherwise including Absorbent cotton wool I.P. and Cotton waste”. From the Assessment Year 1995-96, the State has amended the entry such that cotton means cotton as defined in clause (iv) of Section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 but has specifically included absorbent cotton wool I.P. & cotton waste in such entry. The relevant entry has remained unaltered for the succeeding assessment years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 numbered as Entries 28, 27 and 29, respectively.

41. It is an admitted fact that the appellant herein manufactures surgical cotton from the cotton purchased by him. The assessing authority and forums below including the High Court have noticed that “cotton” and “surgical cotton” are different commercial commodities and therefore, sale of “surgical cotton” attracts sales tax under the provisions of the Act. However, during the proceedings before the High Court it was not brought to the notice of the Court that an amendment to Entry 16 was made in the year 1993 whereby the meaning of the expression “cotton” has been expanded to include “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” and thus, the High Court has only analysed Entry 16 as it stands for the Assessment Year 1992-1993.

42. Therefore, the question that falls for our consideration is whether in terms of the relevant entries for aforesaid Assessment Years “surgical cotton” is liable to tax or not.

43. It appears to us that the commodity “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” as included in the relevant entries is the same as “surgical cotton” which the assessee manufactures. The absorbent cotton wool I.P. is a technical name of the cotton which is sold in the market and commonly known as surgical cotton.

44. The Project Report on Surgical Absorbent Cotton (supra) at page 1 states that “absorbent cotton” is also known as “surgical cotton or cotton wool” and mainly used for medicinal purposes in hospitals, nursing homes, dispensaries and at home (for first aid) etc. The report thereafter uses the term “surgical absorbent cotton” uniformly to refer to the commodity in question before us.

45. The lexicographers have also expressed the same medicinal use and properties of surgical cotton in terms of definition of absorbent cotton. The Collins English Dictionary defines “cotton wool/absorbent cotton/surgical cotton” as “absorbent cotton, purified cotton, bleached and sterilized cotton form.” The Oxford Dictionary of English explains the meaning of “absorbent cotton” as cotton which is used for cleaning the skin or bathing wounds. In Encarta dictionary “absorbent cotton” is defined as under:

“Cotton that has had the natural wax removed, making it absorbent and suitable for medical and cosmetic use as dressings or swabs”.

46. In fact, the Rajasthan High Court in the case of Durga Cotton Industries Vs. State of Rajasthan and Ors., 1994 (1) WLC 696 had an occasion to look into the meaning of the expression “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” while considering notification dated 27.6.1990 which provided the rates of tax for cotton in Item No. 16 (the same as Entry 16 for Assessment Year 1992-93). The Court on consideration of the relevant literature had come to the conclusion that “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” is commercially known as surgical cotton. In our considered opinion, the view of the Rajasthan High Court appears to be correct and consonant with the common jargon by which the commodity is recognised.

47. Having noticed the commodity in question, we would now analyse the import of the expression “including” as contained in the relevant entries.

48. The expression “include” is used as a word of extension and expansion to the meaning and import of the preceding words or expressions. The following observation of Lord Watson in Dilworth v. Commr. of Stamps, (1899) AC 99 in the context of use of ‘include’ as a word of extension has guided this Court in numerous cases:

‘… But the word “include” is susceptible of another construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be equivalent to “mean and include”, and in that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions.’
49. The meaning of the said expression has been considered by a three Judge bench of this Court in the case of the South Gujarat Roofing Tiles Manufacturers Association and anr. v. State of Gujarat and anr., (1976) 4 SCC 601, wherein this Court has observed:

“Now it is true that 'includes” is generally used as a word extension, but the meaning of a word or phrase is extended when it is said to include things that would not properly fall within its ordinary connotation.”
50. Principles of Statutory Interpretation (12th Edn., 2010) by Justice G.P. Singh, at p. 181, has discussed in detail the connotations of the word “include” and emphasized on the exhaustive explanation of the word “inclusive” thus:

“…The word “include” is very generally used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used those words or phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things, as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include.”
51. In RBI v. Peerless General Finance & Investment Co. Ltd., (1987) 1 SCC 424 this Court has followed the observations in the Dilworth case (supra) and explained the purpose and expanse of the “inclusive definitions” as under:

“32. We do not think it necessary to launch into a discussion of either Dilworth case or any of the other cases cited. All that is necessary for us to say is this: legislatures resort to inclusive definitions (1) to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases so as to take in the ordinary, popular and natural sense of the words and also the sense which the statute wishes to attribute to it; (2) to include meanings about which there might be some dispute; or (3) to bring under one nomenclature all transactions possessing certain similar features but going under different names. Depending on the context, in the process of enlarging, the definition may even become exhaustive.”
52. In Karnataka Power Transmission Corpn. v. Ashok Iron Works (P) Ltd., (2009) 3 SCC 240 this Court after analyzing the afore-cited decisions has observed as follows:

“17. It goes without saying that interpretation of a word or expression must depend on the text and the context. The resort to the word ‘includes’ by the legislature often shows the intention of the legislature that it wanted to give extensive and enlarged meaning to such expression. Sometimes, however, the context may suggest that word ‘includes’ may have been designed to mean ‘means’. The setting, context and object of an enactment may provide sufficient guidance for interpretation of the word ‘includes’ for the purposes of such enactment.”
53. The word “include” is generally used to enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute; and when it is so used those words or phrases must be construed as comprehending, not only such things, as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include. That is to say that when the word “includes” is used in the definition, the legislature does not intend to restrict the definition: it makes the definition enumerative but not exhaustive. That is to say, the term defined will retain its ordinary meaning but its scope would be extended to bring within it matters, which in its ordinary meaning may or may not comprise.

Commr. of Customs v. Caryaire Equipment India (P) Ltd., (2012) 4 SCC 645; U.P. Power Corpn. Ltd. v. NTPC Ltd.,(2014) 1 SCC 371; Associated Indem Mechanical (P) Ltd. v. W.B. Small Industries Development Corpn. Ltd., (2007) 3 SCC 607; Dadaji v. Sukhdeobabu; Mahalakshmi Oil Mills v. State of A.P.; Bharat Coop. Bank (Mumbai) Ltd. v. Employees Union, (2007) 4 SCC 685)

54. By introducing the word “including” immediately after detailing the definition of cotton, the legislature has expanded the meaning of the expression “cotton” for the purposes of the Act. While the natural import suggests and prescribes only unmanufactured cotton in all forms, the commodities “absorbent cotton wool I.P.” and “cotton waste” manufactured out of “cotton” are intentionally and purposefully included in the relevant entries alongwith cotton in its ordinary meaning.

55. In light of the aforesaid, we are of the considered opinion that “surgical cotton/absorbent cotton wool I.P.” is also “cotton” for the purposes of the relevant entries in the notifications for assessment years 1993-94 to 1998-99 and therefore is liable to exemption from levy of tax under the Act. In light of the same, we cannot sustain the judgment and order passed by the High Court for the assessment years 1993-1994 to 1998- 1999.",1
Perumal,"Aggrieved by an order in Crl. R.C. No.1119 of 2011 of the High Court of Madras, the unsuccessful petitioner therein preferred the instant appeal.

3. A petition in C.M.P. No.4561 of 2010 (private complaint) under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter for short referred to as “the Cr.P.C.”) filed by the appellant herein against the respondent came to be dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate No.2 at Pollachi by his judgment dated 31st August 2010. Challenging the same, the abovementioned Crl. R.C. was filed.

4. The factual background of the case is as follows:

5. The respondent was working as a Sub-Inspector in an All-Women Police Station, Pollachi at the relevant point of time. On 18th May 2008, one Nagal reported to the respondent that the appellant herein had cheated her. The respondent registered Crime No.18/08 under sections 417 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter for short referred to as “the IPC”). Eventually, the respondent filed a charge-sheet, the relevant portion of which reads as follows:

“On 26.12.07, that the accused called upon the de-facto complainant for an outing and while going in the night at around 10.00 via Vadugapalayam Ittori route the accused enticed the de-facto complainant of marrying her and had sexual interaction several times in the nearby jungle and on account of which the complainant became pregnant and when she asked the accused to marry him he threatened the complainant of killing her if she disclosed the above fact to anybody.
Hence the accused committed an offence punishable u/s. 417, 506 (i) of IPC.” [emphasis supplied]
6. The appellant was tried for the offences mentioned above by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.1, Pollachi. The learned Judicial Magistrate by his judgment dated 15th March 2010 acquitted the appellant of both the charges.

7. It appears that the said judgment has become final.

8. In the light of the acquittal, the appellant filed a complaint (C.M.P. No.4561 of 2010) under section 190 of the Cr.P.C. on the file of the Judicial Magistrate No.2 at Pollachi praying that the respondent be tried for an offence under section 193 of the IPC. The said complaint came to be dismissed by an order dated 31st August 2010 on the ground that in view of sections 195 and 340 of the Cr.P.C. the complaint of the appellant herein is not maintainable.

9. Aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant herein unsuccessfully carried the matter to the High Court. Hence the present appeal.

10. The case of the appellant herein in his complaint is that though Nagal alleged an offence of cheating against the appellant which led to the pregnancy of Nagal, such an offence was not proved against him. Upon the registration of Crime No.18/08, Nagal was subjected to medical examination. She was not found to be pregnant. Dr. Geetha, who examined Nagal, categorically opined that Nagal was not found to be pregnant on the date of examination which took place six days after the registration of the FIR. In spite of the definite medical opinion that Nagal was not pregnant, the respondent chose to file a charge-sheet with an allegation that Nagal became pregnant. Therefore, according to the appellant, the charge-sheet was filed with a deliberate false statement by the respondent herein. The appellant, therefore, prayed in his complaint as follows;

“It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to take this complaint on file, try the accused U/s. 193 IPC for deliberately giving false evidence in the Court as against the complainant, and punish the accused and pass such further or other orders as this Hon’ble court deems fit and proper.”
11. The learned Magistrate dismissed the complaint on the ground that section 195 of the Cr.P.C. bars criminal courts to take cognizance of an offence under section 193 of the IPC except on the complaint in writing of that Court or an officer of that Court in relation to any proceeding in the Court where the offence under section 193 is said to have been committed and a private complaint such as the one on hand is not maintainable.

12. The High Court declined to interfere with the matter in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. The operative portion of the order under challenge reads as follows:

“3. … This court is in agreement with the conclusion of the court below in dismissing the complaint. The complaint provided very little to take action upon, particularly, where this court finds that the respondent had not in any manner tampered with the medical record so as to mulct the petitioner with criminal liability. The wording in the final report informing of the de facto complainant having been pregnant can in the facts and circumstances of the case, be seen only as a mistake.
4. In the result, the criminal revision stands dismissed.”
13. We regret to place on record that at every stage of this matter the inquiry was misdirected.

14. The facts relevant for the issue on hand are that:-

(1) The appellant was prosecuted for the offences under sections 417 and 506 (i) IPC. (The factual allegations forming the basis of such a prosecution are already noted earlier).
(2) The respondent filed a charge-sheet with an assertion that the appellant was responsible for pregnancy of Nagal.
(3) Even before the filing of the charge-sheet, a definite medical opinion was available to the respondent (secured during the course of the investigation of the offence alleged against the appellant) to the effect that Nagal was not pregnant.
(4) Still the respondent chose to assert in the charge-sheet that Nagal was pregnant.
(5) The prosecution against the appellant ended in acquittal.
15. The abovementioned indisputable facts, in our opinion, prima facie may not constitute an offence under section 193 IPC but may constitute an offence under section 211 IPC. We say prima facie only for the reason this aspect has not been examined at any stage in the case nor any submission is made before us on either side but we cannot help taking notice of the basic facts and the legal position.

16. The offence under section 193[1] IPC is an act of giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence in a judicial proceeding. The act of giving false evidence is defined under section 191 IPC as follows:

“191. Giving false evidence.— Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence.
Explanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or otherwise.
Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know.” It can be seen from the definition that to constitute an act of giving false evidence, a person must make a statement which is either false to the knowledge or belief of the maker or which the maker does not believe to be true. Further, it requires that such a statement is made by a person (1) who is legally bound by an oath; (2) by an express provision of law to state the truth; or (3) being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject.

17. A police officer filing a charge-sheet does not make any statement on oath nor is bound by any express provision of law to state the truth though in our opinion being a public servant is obliged to act in good faith. Whether the statement made by the police officer in a charge-sheet amounts to a declaration upon any subject within the meaning of the clause “being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject” occurring under section 191 of the IPC is a question which requires further examination.

18. On the other hand, section 211 of the IPC deals with an offence of instituting or causing to be instituted any criminal proceeding or falsely charging any person of having committed an offence even when there is no just or lawful ground for such proceeding to the knowledge of the person instituting or causing the institution of the criminal proceedings.

19. Irrespective of the fact whether the offence disclosed by the complaint of the appellant herein is an offence falling either under section 193 or 211 of the IPC, section 195 of the Cr.P.C. declares that no Court shall take cognizance of either of the abovementioned two offences except in the manner specified under section 195 of the Cr.P.C.:

“195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence.—(1) No Court shall take cognizance— x x x x x
(b) (i) of any offence punishable under any of the following sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), namely, sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211 (both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, or except on the complaint in writing of that Court or by such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that court is subordinate.”
20. In the light of the language of section 195 Cr.P.C. we do not find fault with the conclusion of the learned Magistrate in dismissing the complaint of the appellant herein for the reason that the complaint is not filed by the person contemplated under section 195 Cr.P.C. It may be mentioned here that as a matter of fact the Court before which the instant complaint was lodged is not the same Court before which the appellant herein was prosecuted by the respondent.

21. Under section 340(1) of the Cr.P.C., it is stipulated that whenever it appears that any one of the offences mentioned in clause (b) of sub- section (1) of section 195 appears to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding before a Court, that Court either on an application made to it or otherwise make a complaint thereof in writing to the competent Magistrate after following the procedure mentioned under section 340 of the Cr.P.C.[2]

22. Admittedly, the appellant herein did not make an application to the judicial magistrate No.1, Pollachi under section 340 to ‘make a complaint’ against the respondent herein nor the said magistrate suo moto made a complaint. Therefore, the learned judicial magistrate No.2 before whom the private complaint is made by the appellant had no option but to dismiss the complaint.

23. But the High Court, in our view, is not justified in confining itself to the examination of the correctness of the order of the magistrate dismissing the said private complaint. Both Section 195(1) and Section 340(2) Cr.P.C. authorise the exercise of the power conferred under Section 195(1) by any other court to which the court in respect of which the offence is committed is subordinate to. (hereinafter referred to for the sake of convenience as ‘the original court’)

24. It can be seen from the language of Section 195(4), Cr.P.C. that it creates a legal fiction whereby it is declared that the original court is subordinate to that court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the judgments or orders of the original court. (hereinafter referred to as ‘the appellate court’) In our view, such a fiction must be understood in the context of Article 227[3] of the Constitution of India and Section 10(1) and 15(1) of Cr.P.C[4]. Article 227 confers the power of superintendence on a High Court over all courts and tribunals functioning within the territories in relation to which a High Court exercises jurisdiction. Section 10(1) and 15(1) of Cr.P.C. declare that the Assistant Sessions Judges and Chief Judicial Magistrates are subordinate to the Session Judge and other Judicial Magistrates to be subordinate to the Chief Judicial Magistrate subject to the control of the Session Judge. It may be remembered that Section 195(4) deals with the authority of the superior courts in the context of taking cognizance of various offences mentioned in Section 195(1). Such offences are relatable to civil, criminal and revenue courts etc.[5] Each one of the streams of these courts may have their administrative hierarchy depending upon under the law by which such courts are brought into existence. It is also well known that certain courts have appellate jurisdiction while certain courts only have original jurisdiction. Appellate jurisdiction is the creature of statute and depending upon the scheme of a particular statute, the forum of appeal varies. Generally, the appellate for a are created on the basis of either subject matter of dispute or economic implications or nature of crime etc.

25. Therefore, all that sub-section (4) of Section 195 says is that irrespective of the fact whether a particular court is subordinate to another court in the hierarchy of judicial administration, for the purpose of exercise of powers under Section 195(1), every appellate court competent to entertain the appeals either from decrees or sentence passed by the original court is treated to be a court concurrently competent to exercise the jurisdiction under Section 195(1). High Courts being constitutional courts invested with the powers of superintendence over all courts within the territory over which the High Court exercises its jurisdiction, in our view, is certainly a Court which can exercise the jurisdiction under Section 195(1). In the absence of any specific constitutional limitation of prescription on the exercise of such powers, the High Courts may exercise such power either on an application made to it or suo moto whenever the interests of justice demand.

26. The High Courts not only have the authority to exercise such jurisdiction but also an obligation to exercise such power in appropriate cases. Such obligation, in our opinion, flows from two factors – (1) the embargo created by Section 195 restricting the liberty of aggrieved persons to initiate criminal proceedings with respect to offences prescribed under Section 195; (2) such offences pertain to either the contempt of lawful authorities of public servants or offences against public justice.

27. A constitution Bench of this Court in Iqbal Singh Marwah & Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah & Anr., (2005) 4 SCC 370, while interpreting Section 195 Cr.P.C., although in a different context, held that any interpretation which leads to a situation where a victim of crime is rendered remediless, has to be discarded[6]. The power of superintendence like any other power impliedly carries an obligation to exercise powers in an appropriate case to maintain the majesty of the judicial process and the purity of the legal system. Such an obligation becomes more profound when these allegations of commission of offences pertain to public justice.

28. In the case on hand, when the appellant alleges that he had been prosecuted on the basis of a palpably false statement coupled with the further allegation in his complaint that the respondent did so for extraneous considerations, we are of the opinion that it is an appropriate case where the High Court ought to have exercised the jurisdiction under Section 195 Cr.P.C.. The allegation such as the one made by the complainant against the respondent is not uncommon. As was pointed earlier by this Court in a different context “there is no rule of law that common sense should be put in cold storage”[7]. Our Constitution is designed on the theory of checks and balances. A theory which is the product of the belief that all power corrupts - such belief is based on experience.",1
SABERABIBI YAKUBBHAI SHAIKH,"The appellants are the wife and the relatives of deceased driver who died in a road accident. The deceased driver was driving a truck bearing No. GJ-17-T-8607, which was owned by Yunusbhai Gulambhai Shaikh, respondent No.2 herein. The deceased was 36 years of age at the time of the accident. On 20th November, 1996, the appellants raised a claim of compensation for a sum of Rs.2,15,280/- and 12% interest therein from the date of accident by filing a claim application before the Workmen Compensation Commissioner/Labour Court. After passage of more than 16 years, the wife and children of the deceased driver had still not received any compensation.

4. The appellants filed a compensation application before the Workmen Compensation Commissioner/Labour Court on 20th November, 1996. The appellants made a claim of Rs.2,15,280/- and also penalty to the tune of 50% of the compensation i.e. a sum of Rs.1,07,640/-, thus, making the grand total of Rs.3,22,920/-. Respondent No.1- the Insurance Company, contested the compensation application. On 23th December, 2010, the learned Commissioner awarded compensation on account of death in the sum of Rs.2,13,570/- with 12% interest from the date of accident. The learned Commissioner also awarded Rs.1,06,785/- as penalty.

5. Aggrieved and dissatisfied with the aforesaid judgment and award passed by the learned Commissioner, the Insurance Company filed First Appeal before the High Court.

6. By judgment and order, dated 24th January, 2012, the High Court has partly allowed the First Appeal. The High Court directed the respondent No.1 - Insurance Company to pay interest on the amount of compensation from the date of ...3/-

adjudication of claim application i.e. 23th December, 2010 and not from one month after from the date of accident i.e. 21st August, 1996. A further direction was issued that the excess amount towards interest, if any, deposited by the respondent No.1 – Insurance Company be refunded to it. The judgment and order of the Commissioner for Workmen Compensation was modified to that extent.

7. In coming to the aforesaid conclusion, the High Court relied upon the judgment of this Court reported in Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation now Uttarakhand Transport Corporation versus Satnam Singh, (2011) 14 SCC 758, wherein it has been held that the interest was payable under the Workmen Compensation Act from the date of the Award and not from the date of accident.

8. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the Hgh Court, the appellants have filed the present appeal.

9. Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the aforesaid judgment of the High Court is contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the case of Oriental Insurance Company Limited versus Siby George and others [(2012) 12 SCC 540].

10. We have perused the aforesaid judgment. We are of the considered opinion that the aforesaid judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants is fully applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. This Court considered the earlier judgment relied upon by the High Court and observed that the judgments in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mubasir Ahmed [(2007) 2 SCC 349] and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Mohd. Nasir [(2009) 6 SCC 280] were per incuriam having been rendered without considering the earlier decision in Pratap Narain Singh Deo v. Srinivas Sabata [(1976) 1 SCC 289]. In the aforesaid judgment, upon consideration of the entire matter, a four-judge Bench of this Court had held that the compensation has to be paid from the date of the accident.

...5/-

11. Following the aforesaid judgments, this Court in Oriental Insurance Company Limited versus Siby George and others (supra) reiterated the legal position and held as follows:

“11. The Court then referred to a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Alavi and approved it insofar as it followed the decision in Pratap Narain Singh Deo.
12. The decision in Pratap Narain Singh Deo was by a four-judge Bench and in Valsala K. by a three-judge Bench of this Court. Both the decisions were, thus, fully binding on the Court in Mubasir Ahmed and Mohd. Nasir, each of which was heard by two Judges. But the earlier decisions in Pratap Narain Singh Deo and Valsala K. were not brought to the notice of the Court in the two later decisions in Mubasir Ahmed and Mohd. Nasir.
13. In the light of the decisions in Pratap Narain Singh Deo and Valsala K., it is not open to contend that the payment of compensation would fall due only after the Commissioner's order or with reference to the date on which the claim application is made. The decisions in Mubasir Ahmed and Mohd. Nasir insofar as they took a contrary view to the earlier decisions in Pratap Narain Singh Deo and Valsala K. do not express the correct view and do not make binding precedents.” ...6/-",1
SANDEEP THAPAR,".This appeal has been filed impugning the judgment and order dated 12th November, 2010 in FAO(OS) NO.607 of 2010, whereby the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant in I.A. NO.13902 of 2008 filed under Order VIII rule 1 praying for extension of time for filing written statement by the defendant i.e. the appellant herein till I.A. No. 11803 of 2008 filed under Order I rule 10 to implead Mr. Sharad Maheshwari as plaintiff. The aforesaid Mr. Sharad Maheshwari is the Managing Director of the plaintiff Company who is privy to the entire cause of action of the suit filed for recovery of Rs.39.90 lakhs based on alleged oral agreement/understanding. The applications filed by the appellant were dismissed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court on 3rd August, 2010.

...2/-

3. The aforesaid order was challenged before the Division Bench. The Division Bench after hearing the counsel for the parties has observed that the learned single judge has correctly held that it is not necessary to implead Mr. Sharad Maheshwari as the plaintiff as the company being a legal entity is entitled to file a suit in its own name through an authorized representative. It is also observed that it is for the plaintiff to prove its case during the trial. Therefore, non impleadment of Mr. Sharad Maheshwari will have consequences only for the plaintiff and not for the appellant. The plea of the appellant that since Mr. Sharad Maheshwari had not filed his affidavit, despite the entire suit being based on an oral agreement alleged to have been entered into between the appellant and Mr. Maheshwari, in case the appellant was to file his written statement that would disclose his defence, has been rejected by the Division Bench.

4. The High Court was of the opinion that even if Mr. Sharad Maheshwari is impleaded and had filed an affidavit, the averments in the plaint could not have been changed. In other words, the character ...3/-

of the plaint, the pleadings contained therein and the relief claimed would remain the same.

5. The application of the appellant for seeking extension in time for filing the written statement has been rejected with the observation that that Order VIII Rule 1 CPC is mandatory and the Court cannot permit filing of a written statement beyond the 30 days from the date of service of summons. At best, the Court has power to permit a period of further 60 days from the date of service of summons upon the defendant to file the written statement. But this has to be done for reasons to be recorded in writing. Since the appellant herein has filed the application beyond the period of 30 days + 60 days, it was not permissible for the Court to allow the appellant to file the written statement.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that undoubtedly the limit under Order VIII rule 1 has to be observed, but in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that the injustice is not done, the Court will have the power to permit the defendant to file the written statement.

7. We have considered the submission made by the learned counsel. In our opinion, the submission made by the learned counsel is well founded in view of the observations made by this Court in Kailash versus Nanhku and others reported in (2005) 4 SCC 480], wherein this Court has observed as follows:

46. We sum up and briefly state our conclusions as under:-
                 (i)     ....


                 (ii)    ....


                 (iii)   ....


                 (iv)    The purpose of  providing  the  time  schedule  for
filing the written statement under Order VIII, Rule 1 of CPC is to expedite and not to scuttle the hearing. The provision spells out a disability on the defendant. It does not impose an embargo on the power of the Court to extend the time. Though, the language of the proviso to Rule 1 of Order VIII of the CPC is couched in negative form, it does not specify any penal consequences flowing from the non-compliance. The provision being in the domain of the Procedural Law, it has to be held directory and not mandatory. The power of the Court to extend time for filing the written statement beyond the time schedule provided by Order VIII, Rule 1 of the CPC is not completely taken away.
(v) Though Order VIII, Rule 1 of the CPC is a part of Procedural Law and hence directory, keeping in view the need for expeditious trial of civil causes which persuaded the Parliament to enact the provision in its present form, it is held that ordinarily the ...5/-
time schedule contained in the provision is to be followed as a rule and departure therefrom would be by way of exception. A prayer for extension of time made by the defendant shall not be granted just as a matter of routine and merely for asking, more so when the period of 90 days has expired. Extension of time may be allowed by way of an exception, for reasons to be assigned by the defendant and also be placed on record in writing, howsoever briefly, by the Court on its being satisfied. Extension of time may be allowed if it was needed to be given for the circumstances which are exceptional, occasioned by reasons beyond the control of the defendant and grave injustice would be occasioned if the time was not extended. Costs may be imposed and affidavit or documents in support of the grounds pleaded by the defendant for extension of time may be demanded, depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case.”
8. We are satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, the High Court ought to have permitted the appellant to file written statement, beyond the period prescribed in Order VIII rule 1, given the facts and circumstances of this case.",1
Om Prakash Chautala ,"Reputation is fundamentally a glorious amalgam and unification of virtues which makes a man feel proud of his ancestry and satisfies him to bequeath it as a part of inheritance on the posterity. It is a nobility in itself for which a conscientious man would never barter it with all the tea of China or for that matter all the pearls of the sea. The said virtue has both horizontal and vertical qualities. When reputation is hurt, a man is half-dead. It is an honour which deserves to be equally preserved by the down trodden and the privileged. The aroma of reputation is an excellence which cannot be allowed to be sullied with the passage of time. The memory of nobility no one would like to lose; none would conceive of it being atrophied. It is dear to life and on some occasions it is dearer than life. And that is why it has become an inseparable facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. No one would like to have his reputation dented. One would like to perceive it as an honour rather than popularity. When a court deals with a matter that has something likely to affect a person’s reputation, the normative principles of law are to be cautiously and carefully adhered to. The advertence has to be sans emotion and sans populist perception, and absolutely in accord with the doctrine of audi alteram partem before anything adverse is said.

2. We have commenced with aforesaid prefatory note because the centripodal question that has eminently emanated for consideration in this appeal, by special leave, is whether the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CWP No. 12384 of 2008 commenting on the conduct of the appellant and further directing recovery of interest component awarded to the employee, the first respondent herein, from the present appellant and also to realize the cost and seek compensation in appropriate legal forum, including civil court, though the appellant was not arrayed as a party to the writ petition, and denial of expunction of the aforesaid observations and directions by the Division Bench in L.P.A. No. 1456 of 2009 on the foundation that the same are based on the material available on record and, in any case, grant of liberty to claim compensation or interest could not be held to be a stricture causing prejudice to the appellant who would have full opportunity of defending himself in any proceeding which may be brought by the respondent for damages or recovery of interest, is legally defensible or bound to founder on the ground that the appellant was not impleaded as a respondent to the proceeding. Be it noted, the Division Bench has also opined that the observations made by the learned single Judge are not conclusive and no prejudice has been caused to the appellant, the then Chief Minister of the State of Haryana.

3. Filtering the unnecessary details, the facts which are to be exposited are that the first respondent was working as Assistant Registrar of Cooperative Societies in the State of Haryana. On 4.2.2001 during a state function “Sarkar Apke Dwar” at Jagadhari constituency the appellant received a complaint from some person in the public, including the elected representative, about the working of the respondent No.1. The appellant after considering the verbal complaint announced the suspension of the first respondent during the press conference on the same day. On 06.02.2001 the first respondent was placed under suspension by the letter of the Financial Commissioner & Secretary to Govt. of Haryana, Cooperation Department, Chandigarh which was followed by charge sheet dated 27.03.2002. The first respondent filed CWP No. 16025 of 2001 against the suspension order which was disposed of on 20.03.2002 with direction to the Government. On 28.03.2002 the 1st respondent was reinstated pending inquiry. After issuance of charge sheet and revocation of the suspension order, the first respondent submitted his reply on 5.6.2002.

4. As the facts would undrape, nothing happened thereafter and he stood superannuated on 31.01.2005 and was granted provisional pension, provident fund and amount of Group Insurance Claim but pension as due and other retiral benefits like gratuity, leave encashment, commutation of other leaves, etc. were withheld due to pendency of disciplinary proceedings. On 6.2.2007 the first respondent filed CWP No. 2243 of 2007 which was disposed of by the High Court directing the government to complete the enquiry within a period of six months from the date of receipt of copy of the order. As the enquiry was not concluded within the stipulated time, the employee preferred CWP No. 12384 of 2008. The learned single Judge vide judgment and order dated 20.10.2009 allowed the writ petition and set aside the charge-sheet and the punishment with further directions to release all the pension and pensionary benefits due to the first respondent within a period of one month with interest @ 10 % p.a. from the due date to the date of payment. In course of judgment the learned single Judge made certain observations against the appellant herein.

5. Grieved by the observations and inclusive directions made in the judgment the appellant preferred LPA No. 1456 of 2009. The contentions raised by the appellant in the intra-court appeal that the adverse remarks were not at all necessary to adjudicate upon the issue involved in the matter, and further when he was not impleaded as a party to the writ petition recording of such observations was totally impermissible, as it fundamentally violated the principles of natural justice, were not accepted by the Division Bench as a consequence of which the appeal did not meet with success.

6. We have heard Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Hitesh Malik, Additional Advocate General appearing for the State. Despite service of notice there is no appearance on behalf of the private respondent, that is, respondent No. 1.

7. As has been indicated earlier, the appellant was not a party to the proceeding. It is manifest that the learned single Judge has made certain disparaging remarks against the appellant and, in fact, he has been also visited with certain adverse consequences. Submission of Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel, is that the observations and the directions are wholly unsustainable when the appellant was not impleaded as a party to the proceeding and further they are totally unwarranted for the adjudication of the controversy that travelled to the Court.

8. In State of Bihar and another v. P.P. Sharma, IAS and another[1], this Court has laid down that the person against whom mala fides or bias is imputed should be impleaded as a party respondent to the proceeding and be given an opportunity to meet the allegations. In his absence no enquiry into the allegations should be made, for such an enquiry would tantamount to violative of the principles of natural justice as it amounts to condemning a person without affording an opportunity of hearing.

9. In Testa Setalvad and another v. State of Gujarat and others[2] the High Court had made certain caustic observations casting serious aspersions on the appellants therein, though they were not parties before the High Court. Verifying the record that the appellants therein were not parties before the High Court, this Court observed: -

“It is beyond comprehension as to how the learned Judges in the High Court could afford to overlook such a basic and vitally essential tenet of the “rule of law”, that no one should be condemned unheard, and risk themselves to be criticized for injudicious approach and/or render their decisions vulnerable for challenge on account of violating judicial norms and ethics.” And again: -

“Time and again this Court has deprecated the practice of making observations in judgments, unless the persons in respect of whom comments and criticisms were being made were parties to the proceedings, and further were granted an opportunity of having their say in the matter, unmindful of the serious repercussions they may entail on such persons.”
10. In State of W.B. and others v. Babu Chakraborthy [3] the principle was reiterated by stating that the High Court was not justified and correct in passing observations and strictures against the appellants 2 and 3 therein without affording an opportunity of being heard.

11. In Dr. Dilip Kumar Deka and another v. State of Assam and another[4], after referring to the authorities in State of Uttar Pradesh v. Mohammad Naim[5], Jage Ram v. Hans Raj Midha[6], R.K. Lakshmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan[7] and Niranjan Patnaik v. Sashibhusan Kar[8], this Court opined thus: -

“7. We are surprised to find that in spite of the above catena of decisions of this Court, the learned Judge did not, before making the remarks, give any opportunity to the appellants, who were admittedly not parties to the revision petition, to defend themselves. It cannot be gainsaid that the nature of remarks the learned Judge has made, has cast a serious aspersion on the appellants affecting their character and reputation and may, ultimately affect their career also. Condemnation of the appellants without giving them an opportunity of being heard was a complete negation of the fundamental principle of natural justice.”

12. At this juncture, it may be clearly stated that singularly on the basis of the aforesaid principle the disparaging remarks and directions, which are going to be referred to hereinafter, deserve to be annulled but we also think it seemly to advert to the facet whether the remarks were really necessary to render the decision by the learned single Judge and the finding recorded by the Division Bench that the observations are based on the material on record and they do not cause any prejudice, are legally sustainable. As far as finding of the Division Bench is concerned that they are based on materials brought on record is absolutely unjustified in view of the following principles laid down in Mohammad Naim (supra): -

“It has been judicially recognized that in the matter of making disparaging remarks against persons or authorities whose conduct comes into consideration before courts of law in cases to be decided by them, it is relevant to consider (a) whether the party whose conduct is in question is before the court or has an opportunity of explaining or defending himself; (b) whether there is evidence on record bearing on that conduct justifying the remarks; and (c) whether it is necessary for the decision of the case, as an integral part thereof, to animadvert on that conduct.”

13. On a perusal of the order we find that two aspects are clear, namely, (i) that the appellant was not before the court, and (ii) by no stretch of logic the observations and the directions were required to decide the lis. We are disposed to think so as we find that the learned single Judge has opined that the order of suspension was unjustified and that is why it was revoked. He has also ruled that there has been arbitrary exercise of power which was amenable to judicial review and, more so, when the charges were dropped against the employee. Commenting on the second charge- sheet dated 15.3.2004 the learned single Judge, referring to the decisions in State of Andhra Pradesh v. N. Radhakishan[9], State of Punjab and others v. Chaman Lal Goyal[10], The State of Madhya Pradesh v. Bani Singh and another[11] and P.V. Mahadevan v. M.D. T.N. Housing Board[12], thought it appropriate to quash the same on the ground of delay. The conclusion could have been arrived at without making series of comments on the appellant, who, at the relevant time, was the Chief Minister of the State.

14. At this juncture, we think it apt to point out some of the observations made against the appellant: -

“Arrogance of power by the Chief Minister seems to be at play in this case” xxx xxx xxx “The petitioner is also justified in making a grievance that first the Chief Minister had suspended him on the basis of a loose talk in the press conference and thereafter the officials of the Government have attempted to justify their own mistakes on the one pretext or the other. The petitioner would term this case to be “a proof of worst ugly look of Indian democracy”. He may be an aggrieved person but his anger is justified to refer this treatment to be an ugly face of democracy. Is not it dictatorial display of power in democratic set up? Final order is yet to be passed regarding this charge sheet. It is orally pointed out that the charge sheet is finalized on 16.9.2009. It is done without holding any enquiry or associating the petitioner in any manner. How can this be sustained in this background?” xxx xxx xxx “Chief Minister was bound to inform himself of the well known maxim “be you ever so high, the law is above you”.

xxx xxx xxx “The respondents, thus, have made themselves fully responsible for this plight of the petitioner on account of the illegalities that have been pointed out and which the respondents have failed to justify in any cogent or reasonable manner. They all are to be held accountable for this. This would include even the then Chief Minister, who initiated this illegal process and did not intervene to correct the illegality ever thereafter.” xxx xxx xxx “The interest awardable shall be recovered from all the officers and including the Chief Minister, who were either responsible for placing the petitioner under suspension or in perpetuating the illegality and had unnecessarily charged and harassed the petitioner.” xxx xxx xxx “Liberty is, therefore, given to the petitioner to seek compensation for the harassment caused to him by approaching any appropriate Forum, including Civil Court, where he can seek this compensation even from the then Chief Minister.”

15. On a studied scrutiny of the judgment in entirety we have no hesitation in holding that the observations made by the learned single Judge were really not necessary as an integral part for the decision of the case as stated in Mohammad Naim’s case. Needless to say, once the observations are not justified, as a natural corollary, the directions have to be treated as sensitively susceptible.

16. In this context, it is necessary to state about the role of a Judge and the judicial approach. In State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal[13], Bhagwati, CJ, speaking for the court expressed strong disapproval of the strictures made by the learned Judge in these terms: -

“We may observe in conclusion that judges should not use strong and carping language while criticising the conduct of parties or their witnesses. They must act with sobriety, moderation and restraint. They must have the humility to recognise that they are not infallible and any harsh and disparaging strictures passed by them against any party may be mistaken and unjustified and if so, they may do considerable harm and mischief and result in injustice.”

17. In A.M. Mathur v. Pramod Kumar Gupta and others[14] the Court observed that judicial restraint and discipline are necessary to the orderly administration of justice. The duty of restraint and the humility of function has to be the constant theme for a Judge, for the said quality in decision making is as much necessary for Judges to command respect as to protect the independence of the judiciary. Further proceeding the two-Judge Bench stated thus: -

“Judicial restraint in this regard might better be called judicial respect, that is, respect by the judiciary. Respect to those who come before the court as well to other co-ordinate branches of the State, the executive and the legislature. There must be mutual respect. When these qualities fail or when litigants and public believe that the judge has failed in these qualities, it will be neither good for the judge nor for the judicial process.”

18. In Amar Pal Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another[15], it has been emphasized that intemperate language should be avoided in the judgments and while penning down the same the control over the language should not be forgotten and a committed comprehensive endeavour has to be made to put the concept to practice so that as a conception it gets concretized and fructified.

19. It needs no special emphasis to state that a Judge is not to be guided by any kind of notion. The decision making process expects a Judge or an adjudicator to apply restraint, ostracise perceptual subjectivity, make one’s emotions subservient to one’s reasoning and think dispassionately. He is expected to be guided by the established norms of judicial process and decorum. A judgment may have rhetorics but the said rhetoric has to be dressed with reason and must be in accord with the legal principles. Otherwise a mere rhetoric, especially in a judgment, may likely to cause prejudice to a person and courts are not expected to give any kind of prejudicial remarks against a person, especially so, when he is not a party before it. In that context, the rhetoric becomes sans reason, and without root. It is likely to blinden the thinking process. A Judge is required to remember that humility and respect for temperance and chastity of thought are at the bedrock of apposite expression. In this regard, we may profitably refer to a passage from Frankfurter, Felix, in Clark, Tom C.,[16]:

“For the highest exercise of judicial duty is to subordinate one’s personal pulls and one’s private views to the law of which we are all guardians – those impersonal convictions that make a society a civilized community, and not the victims of personal rule,”

20. The said learned Judge had said: -

“What becomes decisive to a Justice’s functioning on the Court in the large area within which his individuality moves is his general attitude towards law, the habits of mind that he has formed or is capable of unforming, his capacity for detachment, his temperament or training for putting his passion behind his judgment instead of in front of it.[17]”
21. Thus, a Judge should abandon his passion. He must constantly remind himself that he has a singular master “duty to truth” and such truth is to be arrived at within the legal parameters. No heroism, no rehtorics.

22. Another facet gaining significance and deserves to be adverted to, when caustic observations are made which are not necessary as an integral part of adjudication and it affects the person’s reputation – a cherished right under Article 21 of the Constitution. In Umesh Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh and another[18] this Court has observed: -

“Personal rights of a human being include the right of reputation. A good reputation is an element of personal security and is protected by the Constitution equally with the right to the enjoyment of life, liberty and property. Therefore, it has been held to be a necessary element in regard to right to life of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 recognises the right to have opinions and the right to freedom of expression under Article 19 is subject to the right of reputation of others.”

23. In Kiran Bedi v. Committee of Inquiry and another[19] this Court reproduced the following observations from the decision in D.F. Marion v. Davis[20]:

“25. … ‘The right to the enjoyment of a private reputation, unassailed by malicious slander is of ancient origin, and is necessary to human society. A good reputation is an element of personal security, and is protected by the Constitution equally with the right to the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property.”

24. In Vishwanath Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal[21], although in a different context, while dealing with the aspect of reputation, this Court has observed that reputation is not only the salt of life, but also the purest treasure and the most precious perfume of life. It is extremely delicate and a cherished value this side of the grave. It is a revenue generator for the present as well as for the posterity.”

25. In Mehmood Nayyar Azam v. State of Chhattisgarh and others[22] this Court has ruled that the reverence of life is insegregably associated with the dignity of a human being who is basically divine, not servile. A human personality is endowed with potential infinity and it blossoms when dignity is sustained. The sustenance of such dignity has to be the superlative concern of every sensitive soul. The essence of dignity can never be treated as a momentary spark of light or, for that matter, “a brief candle”, or “a hollow bubble”. The spark of life gets more resplendent when man is treated with dignity sans humiliation, for every man is expected to lead an honourable life which is a splendid gift of “creative intelligence”. When a dent is created in the reputation, humanism is paralysed.

26. In Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay v. Dilipkumar Raghavendranath Nadkarni and others[23], while dealing with the value of reputation, a two-Judge Bench expressed thus: -

“The expression ‘life’ has a much wider meaning. Where therefore the outcome of a departmental enquiry is likely to adversely affect reputation or livelihood of a person, some of the finer graces of human civilization which make life worth living would be jeopardized and the same can be put in jeopardy only by law which inheres fair procedures. In this context one can recall the famous words of Chapter II of Bhagwad-Gita :

Sambhavitasya Cha Kirti Marnadati Richyate”

27. The aforesaid principle has been reiterated in State of Maharashtra v. Public Concern for Governance Trust and others[24].",1
Sasi Enterprises ,"We are concerned with four Criminal Appeals No.61 to 64 of 2007, out of which two Criminal Appeals No.61 of 2007 and 63 of 2007 relate to M/s Sasi Enterprises, a registered partnership firm, of which Ms. J. Jayalalitha and Mrs. N. Sasikala are partners, which relate to the assessment years 1991-92 and 1992-93 respectively. Criminal Appeal Nos.62 and 63 of 2007 relate to J. Jayalalitha and N. Sasikala respectively for the assessment years 1993-94. Proceedings giving rise to these appeals originated from the complaints filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Chennai, before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Egmore), Chennai, for the willful and deliberate failure to file returns for the assessment years 1991-92, 1992-93 and hence committing offences punishable under Section 276 CC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short “the Act”). Complaints were filed on 21.8.1997 after getting the sanction from the Commissioner of Income Tax, Central II, Chennai under Section 279(1) of the Income Tax Act. Appellants filed two discharge petitions under Section 245(2) Cr.P.C., which were dismissed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated 14.6.2006. Appellants preferred Crl. R.C. Nos.781 to 786 of 2006 before the High Court of Madras which were dismissed by the High Court vide its common order dated 2.12.2006, which are the subject matters of these appeals.

2. M/s Sasikala Enterprises was formed as a partnership firm by a deed dated 06.02.1989 with N. Sasikala and T.V. Dinakaran as its partners, which was later reconstituted with effect from 04.05.1990 with J. Jayalalitha and N. Sasikala as partners. The firm did the business through two units, namely, M/s Fax Universal and M/s J.S. Plan Printers, which, inter alia, included the business in running all kinds of motor cars, dealing in vehicles and goods etc. In the complaint E.O.C.C. No.202 of 1997 filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, M/s Sasi Enterprises was shown as the first accused (A-1) and J. Jayalalitha and N. Sasikala were shown as (A-2) and (A-3) respectively, who were stated to be responsible for the day- to-day business of the firm during the assessment years in question and were individually, jointly and severally made responsible and liable for all the activities of the firm. Partnership deed dated 04.05.1990 itself stated that the partners, A-2 and A-3 are responsible and empowered to operate bank accounts, have full and equal rights in the management of the firm in its business activities, deploy funds for the business of the firm, appoint staff, watchman etc. and to represent the firm before income tax, sales tax and other authorities.

3. M/s Sasi Enterprises, the firm, did not file any returns for the assessment year 1991-92 and 1992-93, for which the firm and its partners are being prosecuted under Section 276 CC of the Act. J. Jayalalitha and N. Sasikala did not file returns for the assessment year 1993-94 and hence they are being prosecuted for that breach (in their individual capacity) separately but not for the assessment years 1991-92 or 1992-93 and their returns have been filed as individual assessee by them for the assessment years 1991-92 and 1992-93, though belatedly on 20.11.1994 and 23.02.1994 respectively. In those returns it was mentioned that accounts of the firm had not been finalized and no returns of the firm had been filed.

4. The Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in his complaint stated that the firm through its partners ought to have filed its returns under Section 139(1) of the Act for the assessment year 1991-92 on or before 31st August, 1991 and for the assessment year 1992-93 on or before 31st August, 1992 and A-2 in her individual capacity also should have filed her return for the year 1993-94 under Section 139(1) on or before 31.08.1993 and A-3 also ought to have filed her return for the assessment year 1993-94 on or before 31st August, 1993, as per Section 139(1) of the Act. The accused persons, it was pointed out, did not bother to file the returns even before the end of the respective assessment years, nor had they filed any return at the outer statutory limit prescribed under Section 139(4) of the Act i.e. at the end of March of the assessment year. It was also pointed out that a survey was conducted in respect of the firm under Section 133A on 25.08.1992 and following that a notice under Section 148 was served on the partnership firm on 15.2.1994 to file the return of income tax for the years in question. Though notice was served on 16.2.1994, no return was filed within the time granted in the notice. Neither return was filed, nor particulars of the income were furnished. For the assessment year 1991-92, it was stated that pre-assessment notice was served on 18.12.1995, notice under Section 142(1)(ii) giving opportunities was also issued on 20.07.1995. The department made the best judgment assessment for the assessment year 1991-92 under Section 144 on a total income of Rs.5,84,860/- on 08.02.1996 and tax was determined as Rs.3,02,434/- and demand notice for Rs.9,95,388/- was issued as tax and interest payable on 08.02.1996.

5. For the assessment year 1992-93, the best judgment assessment under Section 144 was made on 9.2.1996 on the firm on a total income of Rs.14,87,930/- and tax determined at Rs.8,08,153/-, a demand notice was issued towards the tax and interest payable.

6. We may indicate, so far as A-2 is concerned, the due date for filing of return of income as per Section 139(1) of the Act for the assessment year 1993-94 was 31.8.1993. Notice under Section 142(1)(i) was issued to A-2 calling for return of income on 18.1.1994. The said notice was served on her on 19.1.1994. Reminders were issued on 10.2.1994, 22.8.1994 and 23.8.1995. No return was filed as required under Section 139(4) before 31.3.1995. The Department on 31.7.1995 issued notice under Section 142(1)(ii) calling for particulars of income and other details for completion of assessment. Neither the return of income was filed nor the particulars of income were furnished. Best judgment assessment under Section 144 was made on 9.2.1996 on a total income of Rs.1,04,49,153/- and tax determined at Rs.46,68,676/- and demand of Rs.96,98,801/-, inclusive of interest at Rs.55,53,882/- was raised after adjusting pre-paid tax of Rs.5,23,756/- . The Department then issued show-cause notice for prosecution under Section 276CC on 14.6.1996. Later, sanction for prosecution was accorded by the Commissioner of Income Tax on 3.10.1996.

7. A-3 also failed to file the return of income as per Section 139(1) for the assessment year 1993-94 before the due date i.e. 31.8.1993. Notice under Section 142(1)(i) was issued to A-3 calling for filing of return of income on 8.11.1995. Further, notice was also issued under Section 142(1)(ii) on 21.7.1995 calling for particulars of income and other details for completion of assessment. Neither the return of income was filed nor the particulars of income were furnished. Best judgment assessment under Section 144 was made on 8.2.1996 on a total income of Rs.70,28,110/- and tax determined at Rs.26,86,445/-. The total tax payable, inclusive of interest due was Rs.71,19,527/-. After giving effect to the appellate order, the total income was revised by Rs.19,25,000/-, resulting in tax demand of Rs.20,23,279/-, inclusive of interest levied. Later, a show-cause notice for prosecution under Section 276CC was issued to A-3 on 7.8.1996. A-3 filed replies on 24.11.1996 and 24.3.1997. The Commissioner of Income Tax accorded sanction for prosecution on 4.8.1997.

8. We may incidentally also point out, the final tax liability so far as the firm is concerned, was determined as Rs.32,63,482/- on giving effect to the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (B Bench), Chennai dated 1.9.2006 and after giving credit of pre-paid tax for the assessment year 1991-92. For the assessment year 1992-93 for the firm, final tax liability was determined at Rs.52,47,594/- on giving effect to the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (B Bench), Chennai dated 1.9.2006 and after giving credit of pre-paid tax. So far as A-2 is concerned, for the assessment year 1993-94 final tax liability was determined at Rs.12,54,395/- giving effect to the order of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (B Bench), Chennai dated 11.10.2008 after giving credit to pre-paid tax. So far as A-3 is concerned, for the assessment year 1993-94, final tax liability was determined as Rs.9,81,870/- after giving effect to the order of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (B Bench), Chennai dated 14.9.2004 and after giving credit to pre-paid tax.

9. We have already indicated, for not filing of returns and due to non-compliance of the various statutory provisions, prosecution was initiated under Section 276CC of the Act against all the accused persons and the complaints were filed on 21.08.1997 before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, which the High Court by the impugned order has permitted to go on.

10. Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, submitted that the High Court did not appreciate the scope of Section 276CC of the Act. Learned senior counsel pointed out that once it is established that on the date of the complaint i.e. on 21.08.1997 the assessment had not attained finality, the complaint became pre-mature as on the date of the complaint and no offence had taken place and all the ingredients of offence under Section 276 of the Act were not satisfied. Learned senior counsel pointed out that unless and until it is shown that failure to file the return was willful or deliberate, no prosecution under Section 276CC could be initiated. Learned senior counsel pointed out that in fact, the second accused in her individual return had disclosed that the firm was doing the business and that it had some income and hence, it cannot be said that A-2 had concealed the fact that the firm had any intention to evade tax liability. Learned senior counsel also submitted that whether the assessee had committed any offence or not will depend upon the final assessment of income and tax liability determined by the appropriate authority and not on the assessment made by the assessing officer. Placing reliance on the proviso to Section 276CC learned senior counsel submitted that, that is the only interpretation that could be given to Section 276CC. In support of his contention reliance was placed on the Judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Gujarat v. Vimlaben Vadilal Mehta (Smt.) (1983) 4 SCC 692, Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Gujarat, Ahmedabad v. Vadilal Lallubhai & Ors. (1983) 4 SCC 697 and State of H.P. and others v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. and another (2005) 6 SCC 499. Referring to Section 278E of the Act, learned senior counsel submitted that till the assessment does not attain finality, Section 276CC is not complete and the presumption under Section 278E is not attracted. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the High Court has wrongly applied the principles laid down by this Court in Prakash Nath Khanna and another v. Commissioner of Income Tax and another (2004) 9 SCC 686, in any view, which calls for reconsideration. Learned senior counsel submitted that the said Judgment deals with the factum of proviso to Section 276CC of the Act which lays down that there is no offence if the tax amount does not exceed Rs.3,000/-.

11. Shri Sidharth Luthra, learned Additional Solicitor General of India, appearing for the Revenue, on the other hand, submitted that Section 139 of the Act placed a statutory mandate on every person to file an income tax return in the prescribed form and in the prescribed manner before the due date i.e. 31st August of the relevant assessment year. Learned ASG submitted that on breach of Section 139(1) of the Act, cause of action to prosecute the assessee arises subject to other ingredients of Section 276CC of the Act. Learned ASG pointed out that what is relevant in the proceedings, is not only the due date prescribed in Section 139(1) of the Act, but also time prescribed under Section 142 and 148 of the Act, by which further opportunities have been given to file the return in the prescribed time. In other words, Section 276CC, according to the learned ASG, applies to a situation where assessee has failed to file the return of income as required under Section 139 of the Act or in response to notices issued to the assessee under Section 142 or Section 148 of the Act. Learned ASG also submitted that the scope of proviso to Section 276CC to protect the genuine assessees who either file their return belatedly but within the end of the assessment year or those who paid substantial amount of their tax dues by pre-paid taxes. Considerable reliance was placed on the Judgment of this Court in Prakash Nath Khanna and another (supra). Reliance was also placed on the Judgment of this Court in Maya Rani Punj (Smt.) v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi (1986) 1 SCC 445.

12. Learned ASG also explained the scope of Section 278E by placing reliance on P.R. Metrani v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bangalore (2007) 1 SCC 789, Kumar Exports v. Sharma Carpets (2009) 2 SCC 513, and submitted that pendency of the appellate proceedings is not a relevant factor in relation to prosecution under Section 276CC. Reference was also made to Ravinder Singh v. State of Haryana (1975) 3 SCC 742 and Standard Chartered Bank and others v. Directorate of Enforcement and others (2006) 4 SCC 278. Learned ASG submitted that the Judgment in Prakash Nath Khanna (supra) calls for no reconsideration, as the same has been uniformly applied by this Court as well as by the various High Courts. Learned ASG also pointed out that the appellants have been indulging in litigative exercises by which they could hold up the proceedings for almost two decades and that the trial court has rightly rejected the application for discharge, which was affirmed by the High Court and the same calls no interference by this Court.

13. We may formulate the questions that arise for our consideration, which are as under:

(1) Whether an assessee has the liability/duty to file a return under Section 139(1) of the Act within the due date prescribed therein?
(2) What is the effect of best judgment assessment under Section 144 of the Act and will it nullify the liability of the assessee to file its return under Section 139(1) of the Act? (3) Whether non-filing of return under Section 139(1) of the Act, as well as non-compliance of the time prescribed under Sections 142 and 148 of the Act are grounds for invocation of the provisions of Section 276CC of the Act? (4) Whether the pendency of the appellate proceedings relating to assessment or non-attaining finality of the assessment proceedings is a bar in initiating prosecution proceedings under Section 276CC due to non-filing of returns? (5) What is the scope of Section 278E of the Act, and at what stage the presumption can be drawn by the Court?
14. We may, at the outset, point out that the appellants had earlier approached this Court and filed SLP(C) Nos.3655-3658 of 2005 which were disposed of by this Court directing the trial court to dispose of the petition for discharge within a period of two months by its order dated 03.03.2006. Learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate rejected the petitions vide its order dated 14.06.2006. Though the High Court affirmed the said order vide its judgment dated 02.12.2006, these appeals were kept pending before this Court over six years for one reason or another.

15. We are, in these appeals, concerned with the question of non- filing of returns by the appellants for the assessment year 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94. Each and every order passed by the revenue as well as by the Courts were taken up before the higher courts, either through appeals, revisions or writ petitions. The details of the various proceedings in respect of these appeals are given in paragraph 30 of the written submissions filed by the revenue, which reveals the dilatory tactics adopted in these cases. Courts, we caution, be guarded against those persons who prefer to see it as a medium for stalling all legal processes. We do not propose to delve into those issues further since at this stage we are concerned with answering the questions which have been framed by us.

16. Section 139 of the Act prior to 1989-90 and after, placed a statutory mandate on every person to file an income tax return in the prescribed form and in the prescribed manner. The Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987 with effect from 01.04.1989 made various amendments to the Income Tax Act, by which the assessing officer has no power to extend the time for filing a return of income under Section 139(1) and to extend the time for filing under Section 139(3), a return of loss intended to be carried forward. The time prescribed for filing a belated return under Section 139(4) or a revised return under Section 139(5) was reduced to one year from the end of the relevant assessment year. The provision of Section 139(2) stood incorporated in Section 142(1)(i). The notice under Section 142(1)(i) to furnish a return of income cannot be issued in the course of the assessment year itself and need not give the person concerned a minimum period of 30 days for furnishing the return. When a return is furnished pursuant to a notice under Section 142(1)(i), the assessment may be made under Section 143 without recourse to Section 147. Further, with the deletion of Section 271(1)(a), a penalty for failure to furnish in due time a return of income under Section 139(1), is abolished. Levy of punitive interest under Section 234A made mandatory and the discretion of the assessing officer to reduce or waive the interest was taken away. Non-compliance with a notice under Section 142(1)(i) may attract prosecution under Section 276CC.

17. The Income Tax Act, therefore, had stipulated both the penalty under Section 271(1)(a) and prosecution under Section 276CC, the former for depriving taxes due to the exchequer and later for the offence/infraction committed. As already indicated by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1989, penalty provision under Section 271(1)(a) had been deleted w.e.f. 01.04.1989 and a provision for levy of mandatory/compulsory interest under Section 234A of the Act was introduced. But, legislature has never waived or relaxed its prosecuting provisions under Section 276CC of the Act for the infraction or non-furnishing of return of income.

18. Section 139 of the Act, as it stood at the relevant time, reads as under:

“139. (1) Every person, if his total income or the total income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income-tax, shall, on or before the due date, furnish a return of his income or the income of such other person during the previous year, in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed.
Explanation: In this sub-section, “due date” means-
(a) where the assessee is a company, the 30th day of November of the assessment year;
(b) where the assessee is a person, other than a company.-
(i) in a case where the accounts of the assessee are required under this Act or nay other law to be audited, or where the report of any accountant is required to be furnished under section 80HHC or Section 80HHD or in the case of a co-operative society, the 31st day of October of the assessment year:
(ii) in a case where the total income referred to in this sub- section includes any income from business or profession, not being a case falling under sub-clause (i), the 31st day of August of the assessment year :
(iii) in any other case, the 30th day of June of the assessment year.
                       xxx         xxx        xxx

                       xxx         xxx        xxx

(3) If any person who has sustained a loss in any previous year under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” or under the head “Capital gains” and claims that the loss or any part thereof should be carried forward under sub-section (1) of section 72, or sub-section (2) of section 73, or sub-section (1) or sub-section (3) of section 74, or sub-section (3) of section 74A, he may furnish, within the time allowed under sub-section (1), a return of loss in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and containing such other particulars as may be prescribed, and all the provisions of this Act shall apply as if it were a return under sub-section (1).
(4) Any person who has not furnished a return within the time allowed to him under sub-section (1), or within the time allowed under a notice issued under sub-section (1) of section 142, may furnish the return for any previous year at any time before the expiry of one year from the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier:
                       xxx         xxx        xxx

                       xxx         xxx        xxx”



19. A plain reading of the above provisions indicates that it is mandatory on the part of the assessee to file the return before the due date. Explanation (a) to the said section defines the term “due date”, which is 30th November of the assessment year. The consequence of non-filing of return on time has also been stipulated in the Act.
Further a reference to Sections 142 and 148 is also necessary to properly understand the scope of Section 276CC. Relevant portion of Section 142, as it stood at the relevant time, is quoted below:

“142. Inquiry before assessment.- (1) For the purpose of making an assessment under this Act, the Assessing Officer may serve on any person who has made a return under section 139 or in whose case the time allowed under sub- section (1) of that section for furnishing the return has expired] a notice requiring him, on a date to be therein specified,-
(i) where such person has not made a return within the time allowed under sub-section (1) of section 139, to furnish a return of his income or the income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act, in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed, or xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx”
20. Section 148 refers to the issue of notice where income has escaped assessment. Relevant portion of the same is also extracted hereinbelow for ready reference:

“148. (1) Before making the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147, the Assessing Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him to furnish within such period, not being less than thirty days, as may be specified in the notice, a return of his income or the income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year corresponding to the relevant assessment year, in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if such return were a return required to be furnished under section 139.
(2) The Assessing Officer shall, before issuing any notice under this section, record his reasons for doing so.”
21. Sub-section (1) of Section 139, clause (i) sub-section (1) of Section 142 and Section 148 are mentioned in Section 276CC of the Act. Section 276CC is extracted as under:

“276CC. Failure to furnish returns of income. If a person wilfully fails to furnish in due time the return of income which he is required to furnish under sub-section (1) of section 139 or by notice given under clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 142 or section 148, he shall be punishable,-
(i) in a case where the amount of tax, which would have been evaded if the failure had not been discovered, exceeds one hundred thousand rupees, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to seven years and with fine;
(ii) in any other case, with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months but which may extend to three years and with fine:
Provided that a person shall not be proceeded against under this section for failure to furnish in due time the return of income under sub-section (1) of section 139-
(i) for any assessment year commencing prior to the 1st day of April, 1975 ; or
(ii) for any assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 1975 , if-
(a) the return is furnished by him before the expiry of the assessment year; or
(b) the tax payable by him on the total income determined on regular assessment, as reduced by the advance tax, if any, paid, and any tax deducted at source, does not exceed three thousand rupees.”
22. The constitutional validity of Section 276CC, was upheld by the Karnataka High Court in Sonarome Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. and others v. Union of India and others (2000) 242 ITR 39 (Kar) holding that it does not violate Article 14 of 21 of the Constitution. Section punishes the person who “willfully fails to furnish the return of income in time”. The explanation willful default, as observed by Wilber Force J. in Wellington v. Reynold (1962) 40 TC 209 is “some deliberate or intentional failure to do what the tax payer ought to have done, knowing that to omit to do so was wrong”. The assessee is bound to file the return under Section 139(1) of the Act on or before the due date. The outer limit is fixed for filing of return as 31st August of the assessment year, over and above, in the present case, not only return was not filed within the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) of the Act, but also the time prescribed under Section 142 and 148 of the Act and the further opportunity given to file the return in the prescribed time was also not availed of.

23. Section 276CC applies to situations where an assessee has failed to file a return of income as required under Section 139 of the Act or in response to notices issued to the assessee under Section 142 or Section 148 of the Act. The proviso to Section 276CC gives some relief to genuine assesses. The proviso to Section 276CC gives further time till the end of the assessment year to furnish return to avoid prosecution. In other words, even though the due date would be 31st August of the assessment year as per Section 139(1) of the Act, an assessee gets further seven months’ time to complete and file the return and such a return though belated, may not attract prosecution of the assessee. Similarly, the proviso in clause ii(b) to Section 276CC also provides that if the tax payable determined by regular assessment has reduced by advance tax paid and tax deducted at source does not exceed Rs.3,000/-, such an assessee shall not be prosecuted for not furnishing the return under Section 139(1) of the Act. Resultantly, the proviso under Section 276CC takes care of genuine assesses who either file the returns belatedly but within the end of the assessment year or those who have paid substantial amounts of their tax dues by pre-paid taxes, from the rigor of the prosecution under Section 276CC of the Act.

24. Section 276CC, it may be noted, takes in sub-section (1) of Section 139, Section 142(1)(i) and Section 148. But, the proviso to Section 276CC takes in only sub-section (1) of Section 139 of the Act and the provisions of Section 142(1)(i) or 148 are conspicuously absent. Consequently, the benefit of proviso is available only to voluntary filing of return as required under Section 139(1) of the Act. In other words, the proviso would not apply after detection of the failure to file the return and after a notice under Section 142(1)(i) or 148 of the Act is issued calling for filing of the return of income. Proviso, therefore, envisages the filing of even belated return before the detection or discovery of the failure and issuance of notices under Section 142 or 148 of the Act.

25. We may in this respect also refer to sub-section (4) to Section 139 wherein the legislature has used an expression “whichever is earlier”. Both Section 139(1) and Sub-Section (1) of Section 142 are referred to in sub-section (4) to Section 139, which specify time limit. Therefore, the expression “whichever is earlier” has to be read with the time if allowed under sub-section (1) to Section 139 or within the time allowed under notice issued under sub-section (1) of Section 142, whichever is earlier. So far as the present case is concerned, it is already noticed that the assessee had not filed the return either within the time allowed under sub-section (1) to Section 139 or within the time allowed under notices issued under sub-section (1) to Section 142.

26. We have indicated that on failure to file the returns by the appellants, income tax department made a best judgment assessment under Section 144 of the Act and later show cause notices were issued for initiating prosecution under Section 276CC of the Act. Proviso to Section 276CC nowhere states that the offence under Section 276CC has not been committed by the categories of assesses who fall within the scope of that proviso, but it is stated that such a person shall not be proceeded against. In other words, it only provides that under specific circumstances subject to the proviso, prosecution may not be initiated. An assessee who comes within clause 2(b) to the proviso, no doubt has also committed the offence under Section 276CC, but is exempted from prosecution since the tax falls below Rs.3,000/-. Such an assessee may file belated return before the detection and avail the benefit of the proviso. Proviso cannot control the main section, it only confers some benefit to certain categories of assesses. In short, the offence under Section 276CC is attracted on failure to comply with the provisions of Section 139(1) or failure to respond to the notice issued under Section 142 or Section 148 of the Act within the time limit specified therein.

27. We may indicate that the above reasoning has the support of the Judgment of this Court in Prakash Nath Khanna (supra). When we apply the above principles to the facts of the case in hand, the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that there has not been any willful failure to file their return cannot be accepted and on facts, offence under Section 276CC of the Act has been made out in all these appeals and the rejection of the application for the discharge calls for no interference by this Court.

28. We also find no basis in the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that pendency of the appellate proceedings is a relevant factor for not initiating prosecution proceedings under Section 276CC of the Act. Section 276CC contemplates that an offence is committed on the non-filing of the return and it is totally unrelated to the pendency of assessment proceedings except for second part of the offence for determination of the sentence of the offence, the department may resort to best judgment assessment or otherwise to past years to determine the extent of the breach. The language of Section 276CC, in our view, is clear so also the legislative intention. It is trite law that as already held by this Court in B. Permanand v. Mohan Koikal (2011) 4 SCC 266 that “the language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of the legislative intent. It is well settled principle of law that a court cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous”. If it was the intention of the legislature to hold up the prosecution proceedings till the assessment proceedings are completed by way of appeal or otherwise the same would have been provided in Section 276CC itself. Therefore, the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that no prosecution could be initiated till the culmination of assessment proceedings, especially in a case where the appellant had not filed the return as per Section 139(1) of the Act or following the notices issued under Section 142 or Section 148 does not arise.

29. We are also of the view that the declaration or statement made in the individual returns by partners that the accounts of the firm are not finalized, hence no return has been filed by the firm, will not absolve the firm in filing the ‘statutory return under section 139(1) of the Act. The firm is independently required to file the return and merely because there has been a best judgment assessment under Section 144 would not nullify the liability of the firm to file the return as per Section 139(1) of the Act. Appellants’ contention that since they had in their individual returns indicated that the firm’s accounts had not been finalized, hence no returns were filed, would mean that failure to file return was not willful, cannot be accepted.

30. Section 278E deals with the presumption as to culpable mental state, which was inserted by the Taxation Laws (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1986. The question is on whom the burden lies, either on the prosecution or the assessee, under Section 278E to prove whether the assessee has or has not committed willful default in filing the returns. Court in a prosecution of offence, like Section 276CC has to presume the existence of mens rea and it is for the accused to prove the contrary and that too beyond reasonable doubt. Resultantly, the appellants have to prove the circumstances which prevented them from filing the returns as per Section 139(1) or in response to notices under Sections 142 and 148 of the Act.",0
Biswanath Bhattacharya ,"These two appeals are preferred against the final judgment dated 9th August 2007 passed by the Calcutta High Court in FMA No.206 of 2003 and order dated 30th August 2007 in Review Application bearing RVW No.2372 of 2007 dismissing the said review application filed by the appellant herein.

3. The facts leading to the instant litigation are as follows:

4. The appellant was initially detained by order dated 19.12.1974 under the provisions of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 (since repealed) and later under the provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as the “COFEPOSA”) on the ground that he in collaboration with his brother, who was living in London at that point of time, was indulging in activities which are prejudicial to the conservation of foreign exchange. The appellant unsuccessfully challenged the detention order. He was eventually released in 1977.

5. While he was in custody, the second respondent issued a notice dated 4th March 1977 under section 6(1) of the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forefeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) calling upon the appellant to explain the sources of his income out of which he had acquired the assets described in the schedule to the notice. Some correspondence ensued between the second respondent on one hand and the wife of the appellant and the appellant on the other hand, the details of which may not be necessary for the time being.

6. Eventually on 27th November 1989, the second respondent passed an order under section 7(1) of the Act forfeiting the properties mentioned in the schedule to the said order.

7. Aggrieved by the said order, an appeal was carried to the Appellate Tribunal constituted under section 12 of the Act. The appeal was partly allowed setting aside the forfeiture of two items of the properties.

8. Not satisfied with the Appellate Authority’s conclusion, the appellant challenged the same in writ petition No. C.O. No.10543 (W) of 1991 before the High Court of Calcutta. In the said writ petition, the appellant also prayed for two declarations – (1) that the Act is illegal and ultra vires the Constitution and (2) that the detention of the appellant under the COFEPOSA by the order dated 19th December 1974 was illegal and void – a collateral and second round of attack.

9. Learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court by an order dated 10th May 2002 partly allowed the writ petition holding that the forfeiture of the property by the second respondent as confirmed by the Appellate Tribunal was illegal on the ground that the notice under section 6(1) of the Act dated 4th March 1977 was not in accordance with the law as the notice did not contain the reasons which constituted the basis for the belief of the competent authority that the appellant illegally acquired the scheduled properties.

10. Aggrieved by the order of the learned Single Judge, the respondents herein carried the matter in appeal to the Division Bench. By the judgment under appeal, the appeal was allowed.

11. It appears from the judgment under appeal that though the appellant sought a declaration that the Act (SAFEMA) is unconstitutional, such a plea was not pressed before the learned Single Judge.[1]

12. Before us, the appellant made three submissions – (1) that the notice issued under Section 6 of the Act is defective and therefore illegal as the notice did not contain the reasons which made the competent authority believe that the notice scheduled properties are illegally acquired properties. In other words, the reasons were not communicated to the appellant; (2) that the forfeiture, such as the one provided under the Act, is violative of Article 20 of the Constitution of India; and (3) in the alternative, it is argued – that the High Court failed to consider the question whether the decision of the competent authority as confirmed by the appellate authority is sustainable and therefore, the matter is required to be remitted to the High Court for an appropriate consideration of the legality of order of forfeiture.

13. Regarding the non communication of the reasons, the judgment under appeal recorded as follows:

“The matter may be looked into from another angle. In 1976 he was under detention. His wife replied to the said notice without complaining of non-supply of reasoning. After his release the respondent No.1 gave a further rejoinder by adopting what had been said by his wife. The authority did not proceed against him until he was served with the reasoning in 1988. The respondent No.1 was also afforded opportunity to deal with the reasonings in his rejoinder. The competent authority after affording him opportunity of hearing passed a detailed reasoned order. He preferred an appeal. The appeal was allowed in part that too by a detailed reasoned order. Hence, we do not find any reason to hold that the fundamental right of the respondent No.1 was infringed.” It appears from the record that initially notice dated 4.3.1977 under Section 6(1) was issued at a point of time when the appellant was under preventive detention. Subsequently, by a communication dated 1st June, 1988, the recorded reasons for the belief which led to the issuance of notice under Section 6(1) of the Act was served on the appellant. The appellant not only filed a rejoinder to the said notice but he was also given a hearing before an order of forfeiture under Section 7 was passed.
It is in the background of the abovementioned facts we are required to consider the submission that the High Court erred in coming to the conclusion that notice under Section 6(1) did not vitiate[2] the subsequent proceedings.

14. In support of the submission, learned counsel for the appellant very heavily relied upon a judgment of this Court in Ajantha Industries and others v. Central Board of Direct Taxes and others, (1976) 1 SCC 1001. It was a case where this court had to consider the legality of the order under Section 127 transferring the ‘case’ of the Ajantha Industries.

15. Section 127 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 empowers the authorities (mentioned therein) to transfer “any case” (explained in the said section) from one Income Tax Officer to another. Further, the section stipulates that before such an order of transfer is made, two conditions are required to be complied with – (1) that the assessee must be given a reasonable opportunity to explain why his case should not be transferred; and (2) the authority transferring the case is required to record the reasons which led him to initiate the proceedings. It appears from the judgment that though first of the abovementioned two requirements was complied with, it was found that no reasons were recorded much less communicated. Dealing with the legality of such an order, this Court held that there is a requirement of not only recording the reasons for the decision to transfer the case but also such reasons are required to be communicated to the assessee.

16. Though section 127 expressly provided for recording of reasons it did not expressly provide communicating the same to the assessee. Still, this Court held that such a communication is mandatory. “10. The reason for recording of reasons in the order and making these reasons known to the assessee is to enable an opportunity to the assessee to approach the High Court under its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution or even this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution in an appropriate case for challenging the order, inter alia, either on the ground that it is mala fide or arbitrary or that it is based on irrelevant and extraneous considerations. Whether such a writ or special leave application ultimately fails is not relevant for a decision of the question.

11. We are clearly of opinion that the requirement of recording reasons under Section 127(1) is a mandatory direction under the law.”

17. In our view, such a conclusion must be understood in the light of the observation of the Court that there was no provision of appeal or revision under the Income Tax Act against an order of transfer. For the same reason, this Court distinguished and declined to follow an earlier judgment in S. Narayanappa v. The Commissioner of Income-tax AIR 1967 SC 523 where this Court on an interpretation of Section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1922, opined to the contra. Section 34 provided for re-opening of the assessment with the prior sanction of the Commissioner, if the income tax officer has ‘reasons to believe’ that taxable income had been under-assessed. Dealing with the question whether the reasons which led the Commissioner to accord sanction for the initiation of proceedings under section 34 are required to be communicated to the assessee, this Court held – “There is no requirement in any of the provisions of the Act or any section laying down as a condition for the initiation of the proceedings that the reasons which induced the Commissioner to accord sanction to proceed under S.34 must be communicated to the assessee.”

18. In Ajantha Industries case, Narayanappa’s case was distinguished on the ground – ”When an order under Section 34 is made the aggrieved assessee can agitate the matter in appeal against the assessment order, but an assessee against whom an order of transfer is made has no such remedy under the Act to question the order of transfer. Besides, the aggrieved assessee on receipt of the notice under Section 34 may even satisfy the Income-tax Offier that there were no reasons for reopening the assessment. Such an opportunity is not available to an assessee under Section 127(1) of the Act. The above decision is, therefore, clearly distinguishable.”

19. We reject the submission of the appellant for the following reasons. Firstly, there is no express statutory requirement to communicate the reasons which led to the issuance of notice under Section 6 of the Act. Secondly, the reasons, though not initially supplied alongwith the notice dated 4.3.1977, were subsequently supplied thereby enabling the appellant to effectively meet the case of the respondents. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that the case on hand is squarely covered by the ratio of Narayanappa case. The appellant could have effectively convinced the respondents by producing the appropriate material that further steps in furtherance to the notice under Section 6 need not be taken. Apart from that, an order of forfeiture is an appealable order where the correctness of the decision under Section 7 to forfeit the properties could be examined. We do not see anything in the ratio of Ajantha Industries case which lays down a universal principle that whenever a statute requires some reasons to be recorded before initiating action, the reasons must necessarily be communicated.

20. Now, we deal with the second submission. The Act enables the Government of India to forfeit “illegally acquired property” of any person to whom the Act is made applicable. The Act is made applicable to the persons specified in section 2(2)[3]. Five categories of persons are covered thereunder. Clause (a) – persons who have been convicted under various enactments referred to therein; clause (b) - persons in respect of whom an order of detention has been made under the COFEPOSA (subject to certain conditions/exceptions the details of which are not necessary for our purpose); clause (c) – persons who are relatives of persons referred to in clause (a) or clause (b). Expression “relative” is itself explained in explanation 2. Clause (d) – every associate of persons referred to in clause (a) or clause (b). Once again the expression “associate” is explained under explanation 3 to sub-section (2). Clause (e) – subsequent holders of property which at some point of time belonged to persons referred to either in clause (a) or clause (b).

21. Section 4 makes it unlawful (for any person to whom the Act applies) to hold any illegally acquired property and it further declares that such property shall be liable to be forfeited to the Central Government (following the procedure prescribed under the Act). The procedure is contained under sections 6 and 7 of the Act. Section 8 prescribes the special rule of evidence which shifts the burden of proving that any property specified in the notice under section 6 is not illegally acquired property of the noticee. Section 6 inter alia postulates that having regard to the value of the property held by any person (to whom the Act applies) and his known sources of income, if the “competent authority” (notified under section 5) has reason to believe that such properties are “illegally acquired properties”, the competent authority is authorized to call upon the holder of the property to ‘indicate’ the source of his income etc. which enabled the acquisition of such property along with necessary evidence. It also authorizes the competent authority to call upon the noticee to show cause as to why all or any of such properties mentioned in the notice should not be declared illegally acquired properties and be forfeited to the Central Government. Section 7 provides for a reasonable opportunity of being heard after the receipt of response to the notice under section 6 to the noticee and requires the competent authority to record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties. Section 7 also provides for certain incidental matters the details of which are not necessary for the present purpose.

22. Expression “illegally acquired property” is defined in elaborate terms under the Act[4]. Broadly speaking the definition covers two types of properties:

      1)    acquired by the income or earnings; and
      2)    assets derived or obtained
from or attributable to any activity which is prohibited by or under a law in force. Such law must be a law with respect to which parliament has the power to make law. A complete analysis of the definition in all its facets may not be necessary for our purpose.

23. From the language and the scheme of the Act it does not appear that the application of the Act is limited to persons who either suffered a conviction under one of the acts specified in section 2(2)(a) the Act or detained under the COFEPOSA subsequent to the commencement of the Act in question. On the other hand, explanation 4 to section 2 expressly declares as follows:

“Explanation 4.—For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby provided that the question whether any person is a person to whom the provisions of this Act apply may be determined with reference to any facts, circumstances or events (including any conviction or detention which occurred or took place before the commencement of this Act).” Apart from that we have already taken note of the fact that there are other categories of persons to whom the Act applies.
24. The appellant happens to be a person to whom the Act applies. He was detained under the provisions of the COFEPOSA. However, such a detention was anterior to the commencement of the Act, which came into force on 25th January 1976, while the detention order was passed on 19th December 1974. It appears from the judgment under appeal that the appellant was eventually set at liberty in 1977.

25. Section 7(3) of the Act provides for forfeiture of the illegally acquired property of the persons to whom the Act is made applicable after an appropriate enquiry contemplated under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act. In other words, the Act provides for the deprivation of the (illegally acquired) property of the persons to whom the Act applies. The question which we were called upon to deal with is whether such a deprivation is consistent with Article 20[5] of the Constitution of India in the specific factual setting of the case coupled with the explanation 4 to section 2 which reads as follows:

“Explanation 4.—For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby provided that the question whether any person is a person to whom the provisions of this Act apply may be determined with reference to any facts, circumstances or events (including any conviction or detention which occurred or took place before the commencement of this Act).” The answer to the question depends upon whether such deprivation is a penalty within the meaning of the said expression occurring in Article 20.
26. Article 20 contains one of the most basic guarantees to the subjects of the Republic of India. The Article in so far as is relevant for our purpose stipulates two things:-

? That no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of the law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence; and ? That no person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.
27. It is a well settled principle of constitutional law that sovereign legislative bodies can make laws with retrospective operation; and can make laws whose operation is dependent upon facts or events anterior to the making of the law. However, criminal law is excepted from such general Rule, under another equally well settled principle of constitutional law, i.e. no ex post facto legislation is permissible with respect to criminal law. Article 20 contains such exception to the general authority of the sovereign legislature functioning under the Constitution to make retrospective or retroactive laws.

28. The submission of the appellant is that since the Act provides for a forfeiture of the property of the appellant on the ground that the appellant was detained under the COFEPOSA, the proposed forfeiture is nothing but a penalty within the meaning of the expression under Article 20 of the Constitution. Such an inference is inevitable in the light of the definition of “illegally acquired property” which by definition (under the Act) is property acquired either “out of” or by means “of any income, earnings …” “obtained from or attributable to any activity prohibited by or under any law …”. On the other hand, if the forfeiture contemplated by the Act is not treated as a penalty for the alleged violation of law on the part of the appellant, it would be plain confiscation of the property of the appellant by the State without any factual justification or the constitutional authority.

29. The learned counsel for the appellant further argued that the forfeiture contemplated under the Act whether based on proven guilt or suspicion of involvement in a certain specified activity prohibited by the Customs Act can only be a ‘penalty’ attracting the prohibition of Article 20 of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that under Section 53[6] of the Indian Penal Code, forfeiture of property is one of the prescribed punishments for some of the offences covered under the Indian Penal Code.

30. Learned counsel for the appellant placing reliance on R.S. Joshi, Sales Tax Officer, Gujarat and Others v. Ajit Mills Ltd. and Another, (1977) 4 SCC 98 submitted that a Constitution Bench of this Court also opined the expression “forfeiture” to mean “a penalty for breach of a prohibitory direction”.[7]

31. On the other hand, the learned Addl. Solicitor General appearing for the respondent submitted that the forfeiture contemplated under the Act is not a ‘penalty’ within the meaning of that expression occurring in Article 20 but only a deprivation of property of a legislatively identified class of persons – in the event of their inability to explain (to the satisfaction of the State) that they had legitimate sources of funds for the acquisition of such property. The learned Addl. Solicitor General further submitted that while in the case of that class of persons covered under Section 2(2)(a) of the Act, the forfeiture though has a remote connection with the commission of a crime and conviction; with reference to the other four classes of persons to whom the Act is made applicable under Section 2(2) (b) to (e), the forfeiture has nothing to do with any crime or conviction. Therefore, to say that the forfeiture under the Act is hit by the prohibition under Article 20 is without any basis in law. The learned Addl. Solicitor General also relied upon The State of West Bengal v. S.K. Ghosh, [AIR 1963 SC 255] and R.S. Joshi (supra) in support of his submission. Alternatively, the learned Addl. Solicitor General submitted that in view of the fact that the Act is included in the Ninth Schedule, the Act is immune from any attack on the ground that it violates any one of the fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution of India, as was held by a Constitution Bench of this Court in Attorney General for India & Others v. Amratlal Prajivandas and others (1994) 5 SCC 54.

32. Lord Green in Bidie v. General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation [(1948) 2 All ER 995 at 998] said in the context of ascertaining the meaning of an expression in any statute that “Few words in the English language have a natural or ordinary meaning in the sense that they must be so read that their meaning is entirely independent of their context”.

33. Chief Justice Sikri in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala and another (1973) 4 SCC 225 dwelt on this subject referring to two English decisions and one American decision stating in substance that the meaning of a word occurring in a statute cannot be ascertained without examining the context and also the scheme of the Act in which the expression occurs.[8]

34. The regime of forfeiture of property contemplated under the Act is not new. At least from 1944 such a regime (though not identical but similar to the impugned one) is prevalent in this country. Two ordinances were made in 1943 and 1944, subsequently amended by another ordinance in 1945, all called Criminal Law Amendment Ordinances, which continued to be in force in this country by virtue of operation of Article 372 and some anterior laws - the details of which may not be necessary for the present purpose. Under the 1943 Ordinance, two special Tribunals were constituted to try cases allotted to them “in the first Schedule in respect of such charges of offence prescribed under the second Schedule etc.”. Essentially, such cases were cases either of charge of receipt of illegal gratification by a public servant or embezzlement of public money etc. The 1944 Ordinance provided for the attachment of the money or other property which is believed to have been procured by means of one of the above mentioned scheduled offences by the offender. Such attached property is required to be disposed of as provided under section 13 of the said Ordinance. Under Section 12 of the Ordinance, the Criminal Court trying a scheduled offence is obliged to ascertain the amount or value of the property procured by the accused by means of the offence. Under section 13(3), it is provided that so much of the attached property referred to earlier equivalent to the value ascertained by the Criminal Court under section 12 is required to be forfeited to the State.

35. Dealing with the question – whether such forfeiture (in the factual setting of the case) violated Article 20 of the Constitution of India?, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the forfeiture contemplated in the Ordinance was not a penalty within the meaning of Article 20 but it is only a speedier mode of recovery of the money embezzled by the accused.[9]

36. In R.S. Joshi case, the question was whether it was permissible for the State Legislature to enact that sums collected by dealers by way of sales tax but are not exigible under the State Law – indeed prohibited by it – shall be forfeited to the exchequer.

37. The question - whether such a forfeiture was a penalty violating Article 20 did not arise in the facts of that case. The discussion revolved around the question - whether such a forfeiture is a penalty for the violation of a prohibition contained under section 46 of the relevant Sales Tax Act? The contravention of section 46 is made punishable with imprisonment and fine under section 63 of the said Act. Apart from that, section 37 of the said Act provided for a departmental proceeding against the dealers who violated the prohibition under section 46. The said departmental proceeding could result in the forfeiture of “.. any sums collected by any person by way of tax in contravention of section 46 ..”. The legal issue before this Court was – whether the State Legislature had necessary competence to provide for such forfeiture? The answer to the query depended upon whether such a forfeiture is a penalty for the violation of law made by the State for the levy and collection of sales tax. If it is not a penalty but a plain transfer of money (illegally collected by the dealer) to the State it would be incompetent for the legislature to make such a provision in the light of an earlier Constitution Bench decision of this Court in R. Abdul Quader & Co. v. STO, AIR 1964 SC 922.[10]

38. As explained above, the issue and the ratio decidendi of R.S. Joshi case is entirely different and has nothing to do with the application of Article 20 of the Constitution of India.

39. To understand the exact nature of the forfeiture contemplated under the (SAFEMA) Act it is necessary to examine the nature of the property which is sought to be forfeited and also the persons from whom such forfeiture is sought to be made. As already noticed, the Act is made applicable to five classes of persons specified under section 2. In other words, the properties of persons belonging to any one of the said five categories only could be forfeited under the Act. Even with reference to the properties held by any one falling under any of the abovementioned five categories, their entire property cannot be forfeited except the property which is determined to be illegally acquired property as defined under section 3(c) of the Act. Of all the five categories of persons to whom the Act is made applicable, only one category specified under section 2(2)(a) happens to be of persons who are found guilty of an offence under one of the enactments mentioned therein and convicted. The other four categories of persons to whom the Act is applicable are persons unconnected with any crime or conviction under any law while the category of persons falling under section 2(2)(b) are persons who are believed by the State to be violators of law. The other three categories are simply persons who are associated with either of the two categories mentioned in section 2(2)(a) and (b). At least with reference to the four categories other than the one covered by section 2(2)(a), the forfeiture/deprivation of the property is not a consequence of any conviction for an offence.

40. Therefore, with reference to these four categories, the question of violation of Article 20 does not arise. Insofar as first category mentioned above, in our opinion, Article 20 would have no application for the reason, conviction is only a factor by which the Parliament chose to identify the persons to whom the Act be made applicable. The Act does not provide for the confiscation of the properties of all the convicts falling under Section 2(2)(a) or detenues falling under Section 2(2)(b). Section 6 of the Act authorises the competent authority to initiate proceedings of forfeiture only if it has reasons to believe (such reasons for belief are required to be recorded in writing) that all or some of the properties of the persons to whom the Act is applicable are illegally acquired properties. The conviction or the preventive detention contemplated under Section 2 is not the basis or cause of the confiscation but the factual basis for a rebuttable presumption to enable the State to initiate proceedings to examine whether the properties held by such persons are illegally acquired properties. It is notorious that people carrying on activities such as smuggling to make money are very clandestine in their activity. Direct proof is difficult if not impossible. The nature of the activity and the harm it does to the community provide a sufficiently rational basis for the legislature to make such an assumption. More particularly, Section 6 specifically stipulates the parameters which should guide the competent authority in forming an opinion, they are; the value of the property and the known sources of the income, earnings etc. of the person who is sought to be proceeded against. Even in the case of such persons, the Act does not mandate such an enquiry against all the assets of such persons. An enquiry is limited to such of the assets which the competent authority believes (to start with) are beyond the financial ability of the holder having regard to his known and legitimate sources of income, earnings etc. Connection with the conviction is too remote and, therefore, in our opinion, would not be hit by the prohibition contained under Article 20 of the Constitution of India.

41. If a subject acquires property by means which are not legally approved, sovereign would be perfectly justified to deprive such persons of the enjoyment of such ill-gotten wealth. There is a public interest in ensuring that persons who cannot establish that they have legitimate sources to acquire the assets held by them do not enjoy such wealth. Such a deprivation, in our opinion, would certainly be consistent with the requirement of Article 300A and 14 of the Constitution which prevent the State from arbitrarily depriving a subject of his property.

42. Whether there is a right to hold property which is the product of crime is a question examined in many jurisdictions. To understand the substance of such examination, we can profitably extract from an article published in the Journal of Financial Crime, 2004 by Anthony Kennedy.[11] “..It has been suggested that a logical interpretation of Art. 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights is:

‘Everyone is entitled to own whatever property they have (lawfully) acquired …..’ hence implying that they do not have a right under Art. 1 to own property which has been unlawfully acquired. This point was argued in the Irish High Court in Gilligan v The Criminal Assets Bureau, namely that where a defendant is in possession or control over assets which directly or indirectly constitute the proceeds of crime, he has no property rights in those assets and no valid title to them, whether protected by the Irish Constitution or by any other law. A similar view seems to have been expressed earlier in a dissenting opinion in Welch v United Kingdom : ‘in my opinion, the confiscation of property acquired by crime, even without express prior legislation is not contrary to Article 7 of the Convention, nor to Article 1 of the First Protocol.’ This principle has also been explored in US jurisprudence. In United States v. Vanhorn a defendant convicted of fraud and money laundering was not entitled to the return of the seized proceeds since they amounted to contraband which he had no right to possess. In United States v Dusenbery the court held that, because the respondent conceded that he used drug proceeds to purchase a car and other personal property, he had no ownership interest in the property and thus could not seek a remedy against the government’s decision to destroy the property without recourse to formal forfeiture proceedings. The UK government has impliedly adopted this perspective, stating that:
‘…. It is important to bear in mind the purpose of civil recovery, namely to establish as a matter of civil law that there is no right to enjoy property that derives from unlawful conduct.”
43. Non-conviction based asset forfeiture model also known as Civil Forfeiture Legislation gained currency in various countries: United States of America, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, UK, Australia and certain provinces of Canada.

44. Anthony Kennedy conceptualised the civil forfeiture regime in the following words:-

“Civil forfeiture represents a move from a crime and punishment model of justice to a preventive model of justice. It seeks to take illegally obtained property out of the possession of organised crime figures so as to prevent them, first, from using it as working capital for future crimes and, secondly, from flaunting it in such a way as they become role models for others to follow into a lifestyle of acquisitive crime. Civil recovery is therefore not aimed at punishing behaviour but at removing the ‘trophies’ of past criminal behaviour and the means to commit future criminal behaviour. While it would clearly be more desirable if successful criminal proceedings could be instituted, the operative theory is that ‘half a loaf is better than no bread’.”
45. For all the above-mentioned reasons, we are of the opinion that the Act is not violative of Article 20 of the Constitution. Even otherwise as was rightly pointed out by the learned Addl. Solicitor General, in view of its inclusion in the IXth Schedule, the Act is immune from attack on the ground that it violates any of the rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution by virtue of the declaration under Article 31-B.

46. Now we are required to consider the alternative and last submission i.e., in view of the failure of the High Court to examine the tenability of the order of the forfeiture as confirmed by the appellate tribunal the matter is required to be remitted to the High Court for appropriate consideration. This submission is required to be rejected. We have carefully gone through the copy of the writ petition (a copy of which is available on record) from which the instant appeal arises.

47. Except challenging the order of forfeiture on the two legal grounds discussed earlier in this judgement, there is no other ground on which correctness of the order of forfeiture is assailed in the writ petition. For the first time in this appeal, an attempt is made to argue that the conclusions drawn by the competent authority that the properties forfeited are illegally acquired - is not justified on an appropriate appreciation of defence of the appellant. In other words, the appellant seeks reappreciation of the evidence without even an appropriate pleading in the writ petition. It is a different matter that the High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction does not normally reappreciate evidence. Looked at any angle, we see no reason to remit the matter to the High Court.",0
Vishal Agrawal & Anr,"A pure question of law which arises for consideration is: whether the amendment in Section 151of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the Act] which empowers the Court to take cognizance of an offence upon a report made by the police under Section 173 of the Code of Civil Procedure [hereinafter referred to as the Code], would be applicable to the pending complaints filed before the aforesaid amendment. To answer this question, scope and interpretation of Section 151, as it stood prior to the amendment, also needs to be considered. This issue has arisen in the following set of facts:

3. The respondent, viz. Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (hereinafter to be referred as the 'Board') is the supplier of electricity in the State of Chhattisgarh. The appellants are the consumers of the Electricity and getting supply thereof through the Electricity connection provided by the Board. As per the Board, the appellants were found committing theft of the electricity which was revealed on 23.3.2006 when the Electricity meter of the appellant was inspected by the Inspection Team of the Board. It transpired that instead of the approved 55.204 KW, the appellants were using load of 59.810 KW and the meter was also tampered with. The Board made a complaint to the Station House Officer (SHO), Police Station, Civil Lines, Bilaspur. On the aforesaid allegations with request to the SHO to register a FIR against the appellants on the basis of a complaint dated 30.3.2006, the FIR was registered by the SHO on 31.3.2006 being FIR No. 227 of 2006 under Section 135/126 of the Act. After investigating into the matter, officer in-charge of the Police Station filed the challan before the Special Judge, Bilaspur who passed orders dated 30.6.2006 taking cognizance of offence under the aforesaid provisions of the Act.

4. Against this order, the appellants filed quashing petition before the High Court on the ground that the Assistant Engineer had no authority to make any written complaint and the Special Judge could not have taken cognizance of the offence without complying with the provisions of Section 151 of the Act. This petition was disposed of by the High Court with a direction to the appellants to approach and raise the said objection before the Special Judge. On that basis, the aforesaid plea was pressed before the Special Judge as well by filing an application to this effect. The contention of the appellants was found convincing by the Special Judge who passed orders dated 26.9.2006 thereupon holding that since the complaint had not been made by the officers named in Rule 9 of the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Rules, 2006, cognizance thereof could not be taken. As a sequittor, the appellants were discharged from the case. At the same time liberty was also given to the Board to take appropriate action in accordance with law.

5. The Board did not accept the aforesaid order and challenge the same before the High Court by filing Criminal Revision on 4.2.2007. Within four months thereof the Electricity Act was amended by inserting, inter alia, Sections 151(A) and 151(B) to the said Act with effect from 15.6.2007. The High Court has by impugned order dated 26.2.2008, reversed the orders of the Special Judge holding that as per Rule 12 of Chhattisgarh State Electricity Rules, the police has been authorised by the Central Government to forward the complaint received by the officers authorised under Section 151 of the Electricity Act to the concerned Court and, therefore, the complaint was validly instituted.

6. Before we take note of the contentions advanced before the High Court and the manner in which the High Court has dealt with the same, it would be apt to reproduce relevant provisions of the Electricity Act as well as Chhattisgarh Electricity Rules, interpretation whereof is involved in the present case.

7. Section 151 of the Act, as it existed before the amendment, is as follows:

“151. Cognizance of offences:- No Court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under this Act except upon a complaint in writing made by appropriate government or appropriate Commissioner or any of their officer authorized by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or Licensee or the generating company, as the case may be, for this purpose.” In exercise of powers conferred by Section 176 of the Electricity Act, 2003 the Central Government framed Electricity Rules, 2005, Rule 12 reads thus:-
“12. Cognizance of the Offence – (1) The police shall take cognizance of the offence punishable under the Act on a complaint in writing made to the police by the appropriate Government or the appropriate Commission or any of their officers authorized by them in this regard or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or an authorized officer of Licensee or a Generating Company, as the case may be.
2) The police shall investigate the complaint in accordance with the general law applicable to the investigation of any complaint. For the purposes of investigation of the complaint the police shall have all the powers as available under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
(3) The police shall after investigation, forward the report along with the complaint filed under sub-clause (1) to the Court for trial under the Act.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-clause (1), (2) and (3) above, the complaint for taking cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act may also be filed by the appropriate Government or the appropriate Commission or any of their officers authorized by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or an authorized officer of Licensee or a Generating Company, as the case may be directly in the appropriate Court.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, every special court may take cognizance of an offence referred to in Sections 135 to 139 of the Act without the accused being committed to it for trial.
(6) The cognizance of the offence under the Act shall not in any way prejudice the actions under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code.” The principal Electricity Act, 2003 was further amended by the Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007 and apart from other amendments in Section 151 of the prinicipal Act was also amended and provisions in Sections 151, 151(A), 151 (B) were inserted. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons for amending the Act, it was stated as under:
“4. As per the provisions contained in Section 151 of the Act, the offences relating to theft of electricity, electric lines and interference with the meters are cognizable offences. Concerns have been expressed that the present formulation of Section 151 stands as a barrier to investigation of these cognizable offences by the police. It is proposed to amend Section 15 so as to clarify the position that the police would be able to investigate the cognizable offences under the Act. The expedite the trial before the Special Court, it is also proposed to provide that a Special Court shall be competent to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial.
1. Short title and commencement. (1) This act may be called the Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007.
2. It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint:
“15. Amendment of Section 151. - In Section 151 of the Principal Act, the following provisos shall be inserted, namely:-
Provided that the Court may also take cognizance of an offence punishable under this Act upon a report of a police officer filed under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974).
Provided further that a special court constituted under Section 153 shall be competent to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial.
16. Insertions of new Sections 151-A and 151-B – After Section 151 of the principal act, the following sections shall be inserted namely:-
“151-A. Power of police to investigate – For the purposes of investigation of an offence punishable under this Act, the police officer shall have all the powers as provided in Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974).
151-B Certain offences to be cognizable and non-bailable. - Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), an offence punishable under Sections 135 to 140 or Sections 150 shall be cognizable and non-bailable.”
8. As per unamended Section 151 of the Act the cognizance of the offence punishable under the Electricity Act can be taken only when complaint is made in writing by:
(i) Appropriate Government, or
(ii) Appropriate Commissioner, or
(iii) Any of their officer authorized by them, or
(iv) A Chief Electrical Inspector,
(v) Electrical Inspector,
(vi) Licensee, or
(vii) The Generating Company, as the case may be.
9. It was the submission of the appellant that the complaint could be made to the Court by the appropriate Government or any of its officers so authorised (as other persons specifically named to make such complaints under Section 151 were not relevant). It was argued that the State of Chhattisgarh has framed Chhattisgarh State Electricity Rules, 2005 in exercise of powers under Section 151 of the Act. As per Rule 9 of the said Rules, the persons who are authorized to make the written complaints were either Assistant Electrical Inspector of Chief Electrical Inspectorate of the State Government or an officer not below the rank of Junior Engineer of the Board or Distribution Licensee. It was the submission of the appellant that in the present case the complaint was made by the Assistant Engineer who was below the rank of Junior Engineer and, therefore, was not authorised to lodge the complaint under Section 151. It was also argued that as per the provisions of Section 151 of the Act, the complaint was required to be made in the Court and not to the police and both these mandatory conditions contained in Section 151 of the Act were not adhered to.
10. The High Court rejected the aforesaid contention holding that Rule 12 of the Electricity Rules authorised the police to take cognizance of the offence punishable under the Act and, therefore, it was not necessary for the Board to file the complaint under Section

151. The High Court also held that by adding proviso to Section 151 along with insertion of Sections 151(A) and 151 (B) vide Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007, this position was made abundantly clear namely cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act could be taken upon a report of police officer filed under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Contention of the appellants that the said amendment came into effect only from 15.6.2007 with the passing of Electricity Amendment Act, 2007 has been repelled by the High Court taking note of the Statement of Objects and Reasons for amending the Act which makes it absolutely clear that the purpose for amendment is to clarify the position already prevailed viz. the police would be able to investigate the cognizable offences under the Act. These are the reasons given by the High Court for setting aside the order of the Trial Court and allowing the Revision Petition of the Board.

11. Before us arguments of the parties remained the same. The submission of learned Counsel for the appellant was that proviso to Section 151 as well as provisions contained in Section 151(A) and 151(B) of the Electricity Act are substantive provisions which could operate only prospectively i.e. the date on which the amendment was notified and could not have retrospective operation, more particularly when the provisions are in the realm of criminal law. He also referred to certain judgments of few High Courts wherein such a view has been taken. Learned Counsel for the respondent-Board, on the other hand, extensively relied upon the reasoning of the High Court in the impugned judgment and cited certain decisions of other High Courts which have taken this very line of action.

12. We may mention at the outset that there is difference of opinion on this issue among various High Courts. Kerala and Calcutta High Court, have taken the view which goes in favour of the appellant herein, in the following cases:-

Chacko, A.K. & Anr. Vs. Assistant Executive Engineer, K.S.E.B. (2010) 2 KLJ 569; Biswanath Patra Vs. Divisional Engineer AIR 2007 Cal 189; Ranjeet Kr. Bag Vs. State of West Bengal (2006) 1 C CrlJ (Cal) 334; Paramasivan vs. Union of India (2007) 2 KLT 733; Kumaran Chemicals (P) Ltd. Rep. By its Managing Partner D. Thillairaj and Ors. vs. Government of Pondicherry rep. By the Inspector of Police MANU/TN/0584/2010.
13. A contrary view has been taken by High Courts of Delhi and Jharkhand in the following cases:

Bimla Gupta vs. NDPL 136(2007) DLT 521; Ashish Kumar Jain vs. State of Jharkhand (2010) CriLJ 271 Interestingly, though Calcutta High Court has taken different view in the two judgments cited above, which are of the years 2006 and 2007, different view has been taken in the case Anjan De vs. State of West Bengal (2008) 1 Cal LT 486 which is in tune with the judgments of Delhi and Jharkhand High Courts.
14. Before we embark on detailed discussion, it is pertinent to point out that this Court has already dealt with the same issue in the case of Assistant Electrial Engineer vs. Satyendra Rai & Anr. (2012) 1 PLJR 476 wherein it has accepted the proposition that FIR with the police can be registered de hors Section 151 of the Act (unamended) which provides for filing of the complaint before the Special Court. The relevant portion of the said judgment is as under:-

Though the report was made by the Assistant Electrical Engineer, it was pointed out before the High Court that even if the police had decided to file a report under Section 173 Code of Criminal Procedure. Complaining the theft, the Court could not have taken the cognizance as provided under Section 151 of the Act and only a complaint should have been filed in writing by the appropriate Government or their officers.
The High Court accepted this contention and held that the very inception of the case was not in accordance with law and, therefore, the first information report in the present case could not be sustained. This is the judgment which has fallen for our consideration.
We have heard learned Counsel appearing for the parties and gone through the appeal.
Considering the position in law, it is obvious that the High Court has completely misconstrued the relevant provision. Considering the definition of “theft” of electricity in Section 135 of the Act, there could be no difficulty that in the first information report, the theft as contemplated in Section 135 of the Act was reported. The only question is as to whether the police could have investigated on that basis and could have filed a charge sheet against the Respondent No. 1-accused, particularly in view of the language of Section 151 of the Act.
15. In that very judgment this Court also categorically pointed out that proviso to Section 151 of the Act was clarificatory in nature. This is so observed in para 9 which is as follows:

Therefore, considering the language of para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is clear that the amendment brought in is clarificatory in nature and as such it would take into its ambit even the pending matters and in that sense it would be a retrospective amendment.
16. Yet, there is one more reason given by the Court to hold that FIR with the police officer would be competent, as can be found from the following extracts from the said judgment:-

There is one more reason why the High Court's order can be faulted. The High Court has clearly ignored the First Schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure and more particularly the second part thereof, which is under the head “Classification of Offences against other laws”. The second entry reads as follows:
If punishable with imprisonment for three years, and upwards but not more than seven years, then such offences are held to be cognizable, non-bailable and triable by the Court of Magistrate of the first class.
Therefore, the High Court ought to have considered this provision which makes the first information report acceptable by the police in the sense that the police could investigate into the matter and if found guilty could have also filed a report under Section 173 Code of Criminal Procedure, before the Court on which the Court could have taken the cognizance of the offence.
17. In view of the aforesaid judgment of this Court, conclusively holding that amendment to Section 151 is clarificatory in nature and further that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 151 of the Act, a FIR could be filed with the police, the matter stands clinched in favour of the Board. However, at the same time we would like to elaborate the view taken by this Court in the aforesaid judgment.

18. It would be essential to first take note of the relevant provisions of the Electricity Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure. The five provisions of the Electricity Act which are referred to are Sections 135, 138, 151, 154 and 175 and these may be reproduced at this stage:

“S. 135. Theft of electricity.
(1) Whoever, dishonestly,
(a) taps, makes or causes to be made any connection with overhead, underground or under water lines or cables, or service wires, or service facilities of a licensee; or

Provided further than if it is proved that any artificial means or means not authorised by the Board or licensee exist for the abstraction, consumption or use of electricity by the consumer, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that any abstraction, consumption or use of electricity has been dishonestly caused by such consumer.
2) Any office authorised in this behalf by the State Government may-
(a) enter, inspect, break open and search any place or premises in which he has reason to believe that electricity [has been or is being], used unauthorisedly;

c) examine or seize any books of accounts or documents which in his opinion shall be useful for or relevant to, any proceedings in respect of the offence under Sub- section (1) and allow the person from whose custody such books of account or documents are seized to make copies thereof or take extracts there from in his presence.
(3) The occupant of the place of search or any person on his behalf shall remain present during the search and a list of all things seized in the course of such search shall be prepared and delivered to such occupant or person who shall sign the list:
Provided that no inspection, search and seizure of any domestic place or domestic premises shall be carried out between sunset and sunrise except in the presence of an adult male member occupying such premises.
4) The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), relating to search and seizure shall apply, as far as may be, to searches and seizure under this act.
Xxxxx S. 138. Interference with meters or works of licensee.-(1) Whoever,
(a) unauthorisedly connects any meter, indicator or apparatus with any electric line through which electricity is supplied by a licensee or disconnects the same from any such electric line; or
(b) unauthorisedly reconnects any meter, indicator or apparatus with any electric line or other works being the property of a licensee when the said electric line or other works has or have been cut or disconnected; or
(c) lays or causes to be laid, or connects up any works for the purpose of communicating with any other works belonging to a licensee; or

Xxxxx S. 151. Cognizance of offences.-No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under this Act except upon a complaint in writing made by Appropriate Government or Appropriate Commission or any of their officer authorised by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or licensee or the generating company, as the case may be, for this purpose.
Xxxxx S. 154. Procedure and power of Special Court.-
1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), every offence punishable under Sections 135 to 139 shall be triable only by the Special Court within whose jurisdiction such offence has been committed.
2) Where it appears to any court in the course of any inquiry or trial that an offence punishable under Sections 135 to 139 in respect of any offence that the case is one which is triable by a Special Court constituted under this Act for the area in which such case has arisen, it shall transfer such case to such Special Court, and thereupon such case shall be tried and disposed of by such Special Court in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
Provided that it shall be lawful for such Special Court to act on the evidence, if any, recorded by any court in the case of presence of the accused before the transfer of the case of any Special Court:
Provided further that is such Special Court is of opinion that further examination, cross-examination and re- examination of any of the witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded, is in the interest of justice, it may re-summon any such witness and after such further examination, cross-examination and re-examination, if any, as it may permit, the witness shall be discharged.
3) The Special Court may, notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 260 or Section 262 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), try the offence referred to in Sections 135 to 139 in a summary way in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the said Code and the provisions of Sections 263 to 265 of the said Code shall, so far as may be, apply to such trial:
Provided that where in the course of a summary trial under this sub-section, it appears to the Special Court that the nature of the case is such that it is undesirable to try such case in summary way, the Special Court shall recall any witness who may have been examined and proceed to re-hear the case in the manner provided by the provisions of the said Code for the trial of such offence:
Provided further that in the case of any conviction in a summary trial under this section, it shall be lawful for a Special Court to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.
4) A Special Court may, with a view to obtaining ;the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to, any offence tender pardon to such person or condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof, and any pardon so tendered shall, for the purposes of Section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be deemed to have been tendered under Section 307 thereof.
5) The Special Court may determine the civil liability against a consumer or a person in terms of money for theft of energy which shall not be less than an amount equivalent to two times of the tariff rate applicable for a period of twelve months preceding the date of detection of theft of energy or the exact period of theft if determined whichever is less and the amount of civil liability so determined shall be recovered as if it were a decree of civil court.
6) In case the civil liability so determined finally by the Special Court is less than the amount deposited by the consumer or the person, the excess amount so deposited by the consumer or the person, to the Board or licensee or the concerned person, as the case may be refunded by the Board or licensee or the concerned person, as the case may be, within a fortnight from the date of communication of the order of the Special Court together with interest at the prevailing Reserve Bank of India prime lending rate for the period from the date of such deposit till the date of payment.
Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, ""civil liability"" means loss or damage incurred by the Board or licensee or the concerned person, as the case may be, due to the commission of an offence referred to in Sections 135 to 139.
S. 175. Provisions of this Act to be in addition to and not in derogation of other laws:- The provisions of this Act are in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force.”
19. As far as the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the 'Code') is concerned, it is essential to point out that it demarcates the offences into two categories, namely, cognizable and non-cognizable offences. As per Part II of Schedule I of the Code, any offence punishable with three years or more of imprisonment is a cognizable offence. Section 154 of the Code prescribes that in respect of every offence which is a cognizable one, information thereof is to be given to an officer in-charge of a police station, who shall reduce the same into writing. Thus, it is the duty and responsibility of the police authorities to register a First Information Report. Sub-section (3) of Section 154 further obligates the police authorities to investigate the same as per the manner prescribed in subsequent sections and thereafter submit its report to the Magistrate, who is empowered to take cognizance of the offence on police report, under Section 173 of the Code, on completion of investigation.”

20. Here, the provisions of Section 4 of the Code become relevant which provide a complete answer to the submission of the appellant. It reads:

“4. Trial of offence under the Indian Penal Code and other laws. -
1) All offences under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.
(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner of place of investigation, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.”
21. It is apparent from the reading of Section 4 that provisions of the Code would be applicable where an offence under the IPC or under any other law is being investigated, inquired into, tried or otherwise dealt with. These offences under any other law could also be investigated, inquired into or tried with according to the provisions of the Code except in case of an offence where the procedure prescribed there under is different than the procedure prescribed under the Code. It is so specifically provided under Section 155 of the Electricity Act also. Thus, it is not a case where any special or different procedure is prescribed. Rather, the procedure contained the Code is made applicable for the offences to be tried under the Electricity Act as well.

22. We would like to discuss here the judgment in the case of In M. Narayandas v. State of Karnataka and Ors.2004 CriLJ 822, which has direct bearing on the issue at hand. The question arose as to whether Section 195 and Section 340 of the Code. affect the power of police to investigate into a cognizable offence. Section 195 provides for prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence. It also states that no Court shall take cognizance of the offences specified therein except on a complaint in writing of that Court or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate. Section 340 of the Code prescribes the procedure as to how the complaint may be preferred under Section 195 of the Cr.P.C. Alleging that the accused had committed an offence under Section 195, the complainant had made a complaint to the police and police had initiated investigation thereon. The accused/respondent had contended that since the case was filed under Section 195 of the Code it was provisions of Chapter XVI of the Code which would apply and not Chapter XII thereof (relating to investigation by the police). This contention was rejected in the following manner:

“8. We are unable to accept the submissions made on behalf of the respondent. Firstly, it is to be seen that the High Court does not quash the complaint on the ground that Section 195 applied and that the procedure under Chapter XXVI had not been followed. Thus such a ground could not be used to sustain the impugned judgment. Even otherwise, there is no substance in the submission. The question whether Sections 195 and 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code affect the power of the police to investigate into a cognizable offence has already been considered by this Court in the case of State of Punjab v. Raj Singh; 1998 Cri LJ 1104 . In this case it has been held as follows:
We are unable to sustain the impugned order of the High Court quashing the FIR lodged against the respondent alleging commission of offences under Sections 419, 420, 467 and 468 IPC by them in course of the proceeding of a civil suit, on the ground that Section 195(1)(b)(ii) CrPC prohibited entertainment of and investigation into the same by the police. From a plain reading of Section 195 CrPC it is manifest that it comes into operation at the stage when the court intends to take cognizance of an offence under Section 190(1) CrPC; and it has nothing to do with the statutory power of the police to investigate into an FIR which discloses a cognizable offence, in accordance with Chapter XII of the Code even if the offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding under the Code is not in any way controlled or circumscribed by Section 195 CrPC. It is of course true that upon the charge-sheet (challan), if any, filed on completion of the investigation into such an offence the court would not be competent to take cognizance thereof in view of the embargo of Section 195(1)(b) CrPC, but nothing therein deters the court from filing a complaint for the offence on the basis of the FIR (filed by the aggrieved private party) and the materials collected during investigation, provided it forms the requisite opinion and follows the procedure laid down in Section 340 CrPC. The judgment of this Court in Gopalakrishna Menon v. D. Raja Reddy; 1983 (3) SCR 836 on which the high Court relied, has no manner of application to the facts of the instant case for there cognizance was taken on a private complaint even though the offence of forgery was committed in respect of a money receipt produced in the civil court and hence it was held that the court could not take cognizance on such a complaint in view of Section 195 CrPC.
Not only are we bound by this judgment but we are also in complete agreement with the same. Section 195 and 340 do not control or circumscribe the power of the police to investigate under the Criminal Procedure Code. Once investigation is completed then the embargo in Section 195 would come into place and the court would not be competent to take cognizance. However, that court could then file a complaint for the offence on the basis of the FIR and the material collected during investigation provided the procedure laid down in Section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code is followed. Thus no right of the respondent much less the right to file an appeal under Section 341, is affected.”
23. Thus, the clear principle which emerges from the aforesaid discussion is that even when a Magistrate is to take cognizance when a complaint is filed before it, that would not mean that no other avenue is opened and the complaint/FIR cannot be lodged with the police. It is stated at the cost of repetition that the offences under the Electricity Act are also to be tried by applying the procedure contained in the Code. Thus, it cannot be said that a complete machinery is provided under the Electricity Act as to how such offences are to be dealt with. In view thereof, we are of the opinion that the respondent's Counsel is right in his submission that if the offence under the Code is cognizable, provisions of Chapter XII containing Section 154 Cr.P.C. and onward would become applicable and it would be the duty of the police to register the FIR and investigate into the same. Sections 135 and 138 only prescribe that certain acts relating to theft of electricity etc. would also be offences. It also enables certain persons/parties, as mentioned in Section 151, to become complainant in such cases and file complaint before a Court in writing. When such a complaint is filed, the Court would be competent to take cognizance straightway. However, that would not mean that other avenues for investigation into the offence which are available would be excluded. It is more so when no such special procedure for trying the offences under the Electricity Act is formulated and the cases under this Act are also to be governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure.

24. In this backdrop, the notification dated 8.6.2005 issued by the Central Government in exercise of powers under Section 176 of the Electricity Act also requires a mention. Vide this notification the Electricity Rules, 2005, have been framed and Rule 12, which is relevant, reads as under:

12 (1) The police shall take cognizance of the offence punishable under the Act on a complaint in writing made to the police by the Appropriate Government or the Appropriate Commission or any of their officer authorized by them in this regard or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or an authorized officer of Licensee or a Generating Company, as the case may be.
2) The police shall investigate the complaint in accordance with the general law applicable to the investigation of any complaint. For the purposes of investigation of the complaint, the police shall have at the powers as available under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
(3) The police shall after investigation, forward the report along with the complaint filed under Sub-clause (1) to the Court for trial under the Act.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, the complaint for taking cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act may also be filed by the Appropriate Government or the Appropriate Commission or any of their officer authorized by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or an authorized officer of Licensee or a Generating Company, as the case may be directly in the appropriate Court.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, every special Court may take cognizance of an offence referred to in Section 135 to 139 of the Act without the accused being committed to it for trial.”
25. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the decisions of Kerala High Court as well as Calcutta High Court and Madras High Court in Chacko, A.K. & Anr. Vs. Assistant Executive Engineer, K.S.E.B. (2010) 2 KLJ 569; Biswanath Patra Vs. Divisional Engineer AIR 2007 Cal 189; Ranjeet Kr. Bag Vs.

Deepak Bhandari,"Present appeal raises an interesting question of law pertaining to the starting point of limitation for filing the suit for recovery by the State Financial Corporations constituted under the State Financial Corporation Act. We make it clear at the outset itself that we are not treading a virgin path. There are two judgments of this Court touching upon this very issue. At the same time it is also necessary to point out that it has become imperative to clarify the legal position contained in two judgments and to reconcile the ratio thereof as well because of the reason that they are contradictory in nature. It necessitates wider discussion in order to avoid any confusion in the manner such cases are to be dealt with.

3. With the aforesaid preliminary introduction to the subject matter of the present appeal, we now proceed to take note of the facts which have led to the question of limitation that confronts us.

4. Respondent No. 1 viz. Himachal Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Limited (hereinafter to be referred as 'the Corporation') is a financial corporation under the State Development Corporation Act (hereinafter to be referred as the Act). It is a statutory body constituted for the purpose of carrying out the objectives of the Act. It is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, engaged in the business of providing financial aid to companies for setting up and commencing operations. Respondent No. 2 (hereinafter to be referred as the 'Company') is the industrial concern which defaulted in repayment of the loan disbursed by the Respondent No. 1. It is now under liquidation. Respondent No. 3 is the official liquidator, who was appointed by the High Court of Delhi for the purposes of winding up the Company. Respondent Nos. 4 & 5 were the Directors of the Company at the time of entering into the loan agreements with the Corporation.

5. The appellant who was also a director of the Company, was a Guarantor for the payment of loans taken by the Company vide loan agreements executed between Corporation and the Company. The following loan agreements were executed along with the corresponding amounts and guarantees:

|Loan Agreement Date    |Amount      |Deed of Guarantee Date  |
|5.6.1985               |20.67 lacs  |5.6.1985                |
|7.4.1986               |8.73 lacs   |7.4.1986                |
|24.11.1986             |15.38 lacs  |24.11.1986              |
|28.7.1987              |7.76 lacs   |                        |
|Total                  |52.54 lacs  |                        |


6. The Company defaulted on the repayments of the loan amount disbursed to it by the Corporation. The Corporation issued a Recall Notice bearing No. PAC 84/ 90/ 6705 dated 21.5.1990 recalling an amount of Rs. 77,35,607/-(Rupees seventy seven lakhs thirty five thousand six hundred and seven only) plus further interest to be accrued from 10.9.1990.

7. The Company failed to make the repayment and accordingly the Corporation, proceeded under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 to take over the mortgaged/ hypothecated assets of the Company. The assets of the Company were taken over by the Corporation on 10.7.1992. The mortgaged/ hypothecated assets of the Company were sold by the Corporation on 31.3.1994 for a sum of Rs. 96,00,000/- (Rupees Ninety Six Lakhs only) by inviting offers by means of publishing advertisements in the leading newspapers.

8. Since the company was also indebted to HP Financial Corporation, amount realised from the sale of the company's assets was apportioned between these two secured creditors. After adjusting the sale proceeds against the outstanding debts of the Company, in proportion to the term loans advanced by the Corporation and Himachal Pradesh Financial Corporation; a sum of Rs. 68,96,564/- (Rupees Sixty Eight Lakhs Ninety Six Thousand Five Hundred and Sixty Four only) still remained outstanding against the Company.

9. The Corporation preferred a Civil Suit No. 85 of 1995 on 26.12.1994 titled as Himachal Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Limited v. M/s RKB Herbals Pvt. Ltd and Ors., for recovery of sum of Rs. 30,60,732/- (Rupees Thirty Lakhs Sixty Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty Two only). The sum above mentioned was calculated as follows by the Corporation:

|Recoverable amount on 31.5.1994                              |
|Principal Amount (Rs./-)             |5,16,582               |
|Interest                             |63,79,982              |
|Total                                |68,96,564              |
|Less Penal Interest                  |38,35,832              |
|Net Amount for which suit was filed  |30,60,732              |


10. The Civil Suit No. 85 of 1995 was decreed in favour of the Corporation vide judgment and decree dated 6.6.2008 passed by the Single Judge of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, granting a decree of Rs. 30,60,732/- (Rupees Thirty Lakhs Sixty Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty Two only) along with interest at the rate of 12% from the date of filing of suit till the realization of the said amount.

11. Before the learned Single Judge of the High Court a plea was taken by the defendants, including the appellant herein, that the suit was time barred as it was filed beyond the period of 3 years from the date of commencement of limitation period. To appreciate this plea we recapitulate some relevant dates:

|Date           |Event                                     |
|21.5.1990      |Recall notice sent by the Corporation,    |
|               |recalling the outstanding amount.         |
|10.7.1992      |Mortgage/ hypothecated assets of the      |
|               |Company taken over by the Corporation.    |
|31.3.1994      |The Mortgage/ hypothecated assets of the  |
|               |Company sold by the Corporation.          |
|21.5.1994      |Notice issued to all the three Directors  |
|               |of the Company for payment of outstanding |
|               |amount.                                   |
|26.12.1994     |Suit for recovery of the balance          |
|               |outstanding filed by the Corporation.     |


12. As per the defendants cause of action for filing the recovery suit arose on 21.5.1990 when recall notice was issued by the Corporation to the Company and the Guarantors. Therefore, the suit was to be filed within a period of 3 years from the said date and calculated in this manner, last date for filing the suit was 20.5.1993. It was, thus, pleaded that the suit filed on 26.12.1994 was beyond the period of 3 years from 21.5.1990 and, therefore, the same was time barred. The Corporation, on the other hand, contended that action for selling the mortgage/ hypothecated properties of the Company was taken under the provisions of Section 29 of the Act and the sale of these assets were fructified on 21.3.1994. It is on the realization of sale proceeds only, the balance amount payable by the guarantors could be ascertained. Therefore, the starting point for counting the limitation period is 31.3.1994 and the suit filed by the Corporation on 26.12.1996 was well within the period of limitation.

13. The learned Single Judge deciding in favour of the Corporation, held the suit to be well within limitation. The suit was decreed against all the defendants including the appellant herein, holding them to be jointly and severely liable to pay the decretal amount. The appellant herein preferred an intra court appeal against the judgment and decree dated 6.6.2008. The Division Bench has also negatived the contention of the appellant affirming the finding of the single Judge and holding the suit to be within limitation.

14. We have already taken note of the stand of the parties on either side. It is apparent from the above that the main issue is as to whether the limitation for filing the suit would start on 21.5.1990, when the notice of recall was issued or the starting point would be 31.3.1994, when the assets of the Company were sold and the balance amount payable (for which suit is filed) was ascertained on that date. We have already pointed out in the beginning that there are two judgments of this Court which have dealt with the aforesaid issue. First judgment is known as Maharashtra State Financial Corporation v. Ashok K. Agarwal & Ors. 2006 (9) SCC 617. In that case the appellant Maharashtra State Financial Corporation had sanctioned Rs. 5 lakhs in favour of a Company. The Respondents were directors of the said borrower company and stood sureties for the loan. When the company failed to repay the loan, a notice dated 8.3.1983 was issued calling upon the borrower to repay its due. On 25.10.1983, an application under Ss. 31 and 32 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 was filed by the Corporation. On 11.6.1990 the attached properties of the borrower company were put to sale. There was a shortfall in the amount realised and hence notices dated 27.1.1991 were sent to respondent sureties claiming Rs. 16,79,033 together with interest at the rate of 14.5.% p.a. On 2.1.1992 the appellant Corporation filed an application under Section 31(1)(aa) of the Act for recovery of the said balance amount. The respondent took various objections including that of limitation, contending that Article 137 of the Limitation Act was applicable and not Article 136. According to the respondents, Article 137 of the Limitation Act was applicable and as per that provision such an application could be made within a period of three years. Article 137 applies in cases where no period of limitation is specifically prescribed. It was submitted that as no period of limitation is prescribed for an application under Sections 31 and 32 of the Act, Article 137 would apply. The additional District Judge upheld the contention of the respondents and the application of the Corporation was dismissed as barred by limitation. The appellant Corporation filed an appeal against the said order in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Bench at Panaji. The appeal was dismissed by the High Court by the impugned order dated 22.7.1998. The High Court upheld the reasoning of the Additional District Judge. This Court affirmed the order of the High Court holding that Article 137 of the Limitation Act would apply and the suit was to be filed within a period of three years. Contention of the Financial Corporation predicating its case on Article 136 of the Limitation Act on the ground that application under Section 138 was in the nature of execution proceedings and, therefore, period of 12 years for execution of the decrees is available to the Financial Corporation, was repelled by the Court. The Court categorically held that Section 31 of the Act only contains a legal fiction and at best refer to the procedure to be followed, but that would not mean that there is a decree or order of a Civil Court, stricto sensu, which is to be executed, in as much as there is no decree or order of the Civil Court being executed.

15. From the reading of the aforesaid judgment, one thing is clear. The Court was concerned with the proceedings under Section 31 of the Act and the issue was as to whether limitation period would be 3 years as per Article 137 of the Limitation Act or it would be 12 years as provided under Article 136 of the Limitation Act. While dealing with that issue the Court, in the process also dealt with the nature of proceedings under Section 31 of the Act namely whether this would be in the nature of a suit or execution of decree. The Court answered by holding that for such proceedings Article 137 of the Limitation Act would apply meaning thereby, period of limitation is 3 years. From the reading of this judgment, it becomes abundantly clear that the issue to which would be the starting date for counting the period of limitation, was neither raised or dealt with. Obviously, therefore, there is no discussion or decision on this aspect in the said judgment.

16. We would like to refer to the law laid down by this Court in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Smt. Raj Kumari and Ors.; 2007 (13) SCALE 113. In the said case, well known proposition, namely, it is ratio of a case which is applicable and not what logically flows therefrom is enunciated in a lucid manner. We would like to quote the following observations therefrom:-

10. Reliance on the decision without looking into the factual background of the case before it is clearly impermissible. A decision is a precedent on its own facts. Each case presents its own features. It is not everything said by a Judge while giving a judgment that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a Judge's decision binding a party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. According to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates - (i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential. An inferential finding of facts is the inference which the Judge draws from the direct,"" or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on the combined effect of the above. A decision is an, authority for what it actually decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment. The enunciation of the reason or principle on which a question before a Court has been decided is alone binding as a precedent.(See: State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra and Ors. (1970) ILLJ 662 SC and Union of India and Ors.v. Dhanwanti Devi and Ors. (1996) 6 SCC 44. A case is a precedent and binding for what it explicitly decides and no more. The words used by Judges in their judgments are not to be read as if they are words in Act of Parliament. In Quinn v. Leathern (1901) AC 495 (H.L.), Earl of Halsbury LC observed that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which are found there are not intended to be exposition of the whole law but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are found and a case is only an authority for what it actually decides.
11.Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of Courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of Courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd.v. Horton 1951 AC 737 Lord Mac Dermot observed: The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima vertra of Willes, J as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished judge.
The aforesaid principle was reiterated in Government of Karnataka and Ors. vs. Smt. Gowramma and Ors. 2007 (14) SCALE 613, wherein, the Court observed as under:-

“10. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of Courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of Courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. vs. Horton 1951 AC 737, Lord Mac Dermot observed: The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima vertra of Willes, J as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished judge.”
17. Other case of this Court, which is relied upon by the High Court as well, is the decision dated 18.12.2003 in C.A. No. 1971 of 1998 titled as HP Financial Corporation v. Pawana & Ors. In that case recall notice was given to the defaulting Company on 4.1.1977; possession of mortgage/ hypothecated assets of the Company was taken over on 25.10.1982 in exercise of powers under Section 29 of the Act; these assets were sold on 29.3.1984 and 14.3.1985; notice for payment of balance amount was issued to the guarantors on 22.5.1985 and suit for recovery of the balance amount was filed on 15.9.1985.

18. A single Judge of the Himachal Pradesh High Court held that the period of limitation for such a suit started after the sale and when balance was found due and, therefore, suit was within the period of limitation. However, when the suit reached hearing before another Judge of the High Court he disagreed with the earlier view and referred the matter to a larger Bench. The Division Bench of the High Court answered the question by holding that the suit for balance amount was filed as a result of the non- payment of debt by the principle debtor which was the date when cause of action arose. Therefore, the suit should have been filed within 3 years from the date of recall notice. The suit was, thus, dismissed as time barred. This Court reversed the judgment of the High Court. While doing so, it referred to clause 7 of the mortgage deed which was to the following effect:

“Without prejudice to the above rights and powers conferred on the Corporation by these presents and by Section 29 and 30 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951, and as amended in 1956 and 1972 and the special remedies available to the Corporation under the said Act, it is hereby further agreed and declared that if the partners of the industrial concern fail to pay the said principal sum with interest and other moneys due from him under these rpesents, to the Corporation in the manner agreed, the Corporation shall be entitled to realise tis dues by sale of the mortgaged properties, the said fixtures and fittings and other assets, and if the sale proceeds thereof are insufficient to satisfy the dues of the Corporation, to recover the balance from the partners of the industrial concern and the other properties owned by them though not included in this security.” (emphasis supplied).
19. On the basis of the aforesaid clause the Court found fault with the approach of the High Court in as much as clause 7 specifically provided that the Corporation could filed recovery proceedings against the partners of the Industrial concern if the sale proceeds of the assets of the industrial concern were insufficient to satisfy the dues of the Corporation.

20. Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant tried to distinguish this judgment by vehemently arguing that the aforesaid case was based on interpretation of clause 7 of the mortgage deed which was executed between the parties and in the present case such a clause is conspicuously absent. Had the judgment of this Court rested solely on clause 7 of the mortgage deed, the aforesaid argument of Mr. Dhruv Mehta would have been of some credence. However, we find that the Court also specifically discussed the issue as to when right to sue on the indemnity would arise and specific answer given to this question was that it would be only after the assets were sold of. The judgment was also rested on another pertinent aspect viz. since the mortgage deed was executed, the period of limitation would be 12 years if a mortgage suit was to be filed. Following discussion in the said judgment on this aspect squarely answers the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant:

“Whilst considering the question of limitation the Division Bench has given a very lengthy judgment running into approximately 50 pages. However they appear to have not noticed the fact that under Clause 7 an indemnity had been given. Therefore, the premise on which the judgment proceeds i.e. that the loan transaction and the mortgage deed, are one composite transaction which was inseparable is entirely erroneous. It is settled law that a contract of indemnity and/ or guarantee is an independent and separate contract from the main contract. Thus the question which they required to address themselves, which unfortunately they did not, was when does the right to sue on the indemnity arose. In our view, there can be only one answer to this question. The right to sue on the contract of indemnity arose only after the assets were sold off. It is only at that stage that the balance due became ascertained. It is at that stage only that a suit for recovery of the balance could have been filed. Merely because the Corporation acted under Section 29 of the Financial Corporation Act did not mean that the contract of indemnity came to an end. Section 29 merely enabled the Corporation to take possession and sell the assets for recovery of the dues under the main contract. It may be that on the Corporation taking action under Section 29 and on their taking possession they became deemed owners. The mortgage may have come to an end, but the contract of indemnity, which was an independent contract, did not. The right to claim for the balance arose, under the contract of indemnity, only when the sale proceeds were found to be insufficient.
In this case, it is an admitted position that the sale took place on 28.1.1984 and 14.3.1985. it is only after this date that the question of right to sue on the indemnity (contained in Clause 7) arose. The suit having been filed on 15.9.1985 was well within limitation. Therefore, it was erroneous to hold that the suit was barred by the law of limitation.
Even otherwise, it must be mentioned that the Division Bench was in error in stating that the right to personally recover the balance terminates after the expiry of three years. It must be remembered that the question of recovery of balance will only arise after the remedy in respect of the mortgage deed has first been exhaustive. If a mortgage suit was to be filed, the period of limitation would be 12 years. Of course, in such a suit, a prayer can also be made for a personal decree on the sale proceeds being insufficient. Even though such prayer may be made, the suit remains a mortgage suit. Therefore, the period of limitation in such cases will remain 12 years”. [Emphasis Supplied]
21. We thus, hold that when the Corporation takes steps for recovery of the amount by resorting to the provisions of Section 29 of the Act, the limitation period for recovery of the balance amount would start only after adjusting the proceeds from the sale of assets of the industrial concern. As the Corporation would be in a position to know as to whether there is a shortfall or there is excess amount realised, only after the sale of the mortgage/ hypothecated assets. This is clear from the language of sub-Section (1) of Section 29 which makes the position abundantly clear and is quoted below:

“Where nay industrial concern, which is under a liability to the Financial Corporation under an agreement, makes any default in repayment of any loan or advance or any installment thereof or in meeting its obligations in relation to any guarantee given by the Corporation or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of its agreement with the Financial Corporation, the Financial Corporation shall have the right to take over the management or possession or both of the industrial concern, as well as the right to transfer by way of lease or sale and realise the property pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated or assigned to the Financial Corporation.”
22. It is thus clear that merely because the Corporation acted under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act did not mean that the contract of indemnity came to an end. Section 29 merely enabled the Corporation to take possession and sell the assets for recovery of the dues under the main contract. It may be that only the Corporation taking action under Section 29 and on their taking possession they became deemed owners. The mortgage may have come to an end, but the contract of indemnity, which was an independent contract, did not. The right to claim for the balance arose, under the contract of indemnity, only when the sale proceeds were found to be insufficient. The right to sue on the contract of indemnity arose after the assets were sold. The present case would fall under Article 55 of the Limitation Act, 1963 which corresponds to old Articles 115 and 116 of the old Limitation Act, 1908. The right to sue on a contract of indemnity/ guarantee would arise when the contract is broken.

23. Therefore, the period of limitation is to be counted from the date when the assets of the Company were sold and not when the recall notice was given.",0
KESHAR BAI,"This appeal, by grant of special leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 03/08/2010 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Indore allowing Second Appeal No. 756 of 2004 filed by the respondent.

3. Briefly put, the facts are that the appellant-landlady purchased House No. 1/2, Street No. 6, Parsi Mohallah, Indore (‘the said building’) from M/s. Pyare Mohan Khar, Hari Mohan Khar, Shayam Sunder Khar and Anil Khar predecessors-in-title of the appellant by a registered sale deed dated 26/9/1991 for a consideration of Rs. 1,70,000/-. At the time of purchase of the said building, the respondent-tenant was occupying one room (‘suit premises’) situated on the rear side of the said building as tenant. The respondent was informed by the predecessors-in-title of the appellant that the appellant is the new landlady of the said building and he should pay the rent to her. The respondent agreed to pay the rent but failed to pay it. Failure of the respondent to pay the rent resulted in a notice being sent by the appellant to him on 23/11/2002, but despite the notice the respondent did not pay the rent.

4. On 06/1/2003, the appellant filed a suit for eviction of the respondent under the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961 (‘the M.P. Act’) on grounds of non-payment of rent, denial of the appellant’s title by the respondent, bona fide need for residential purpose and reconstruction of the said building as it had become unsafe for human habitation. It was specifically averred in the plaint that the appellant had purchased the said building vide a registered document on 26/9/1991.

5. The respondent contested the said suit and filed a written statement denying the title of the appellant as well as the grounds on which his eviction from the suit premises was sought. The respondent denied that there was any attornement between the parties and that there was a landlord- tenant relationship between him and the appellant. He claimed to be tenant of the earlier landlord Shri Khar. He contended that he had never paid any rent to the appellant. He denied the genuineness of the registered sale deed dated 26/9/1991.

6. The trial court decreed the suit under Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. The suit was dismissed so far as the other grounds are concerned. The trial court’s judgment was confirmed by the first appellate court. The High Court by the impugned order set aside the eviction decree passed by the courts below holding that in the facts of the case no decree under Section 12 (1) (c) of the M.P. Act could be passed. The controversy, therefore, revolves around Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act in the context of the facts of this case.

7. Shri Ardhendumauli Kumar Prasad, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that both the courts having concurrently found that the landlord was entitled to a decree of eviction under Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act and since there was no perversity attached to the said finding, the High Court ought not to have interfered with it while dealing with a second appeal, particularly, when there was no substantial question of law involved in the matter. In this connection, he relied on Deep Chandra Juneja v. Lajwanti Kathuria (dead) through LRs.[1], Yash Pal v. Ram Lal & Ors.[2] and Firojuddin & Anr. v. Babu Singh[3]. Mr. Prasad submitted that it is clearly established from the evidence on record that the respondent had denied the title of the appellant and, therefore, the case clearly falls within the ambit of Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. The eviction decree was, therefore, correctly passed by the trial court and confirmed by the first appellate court. In this connection he relied on Devasahyam v. P. Savithramma[4], State of Andgra Pradesh & Ors. v. D. Raghukul Pershad(dead) by LRs.& Ors.[5] and Bhogadi Kannababu & Ors. v. Vuggina Pydamma & Ors.[6]. Counsel submitted that in the circumstances the impugned order be set aside.

8. Shri Amit Pawan, learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand submitted that attornment of tenancy to the appellant is not proved. Counsel submitted that the respondent had no knowledge about the sale transaction that allegedly took place between the appellant and Shri Khar, under which the appellant is said to have purchased the suit premises. This is a case of derivative title which the tenant can deny if he had no knowledge of the sale transaction. Counsel submitted that the trial court and lower appellate court ignored this vital legal position and, therefore, the High Court rightly set aside the eviction decree. Counsel relied on Mohd. Nooman & Ors. v. Mohd. Jabed Alam & Ors.[7] in support of his submission that the issue regarding title can be decided in an eviction suit and, therefore, it was correctly raised by the respondent.

9. It is well settled by a long line of judgments of this Court that the High Court should not interfere with a concurrent finding of fact unless it is perverse. (See: Deep Chandra Juneja, Yash Pal & Firojuddin). In this case, for the reasons which we shall soon record, we are unable to find any such perversity in the concurrent finding of fact returned by the courts below warranting the High Court’s interference.

10. The trial court passed the decree under Section 12 (1)(c) of the M.P. Act on the ground that the respondent-tenant denied the title of the appellant-landlady. It was confirmed by the first appellate court. It is, therefore, necessary to reproduce Section 12(1) (c) of the M.P. Act. It reads as under:

“12. Restriction on eviction of tenants.—(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract, no suit shall be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds only, namely—
(a) xxx
(b) xxx
(c) that the tenant or any person residing with him has created nuisance or has done any act which is inconsistent with the purpose for which he was admitted to the tenancy of the accommodation, or which is likely to affect adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord therein:
Provided that the use by a tenant of a portion of the accommodation as his office shall not be deemed to be an act inconsistent with the purpose for which he was admitted to the tenancy;”
11. The first question that arises is how denial of title falls within the ambit of Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. Under Section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the lease is determined by forfeiture, if the lessee denies the lessor’s title. While dealing with eviction suit, arising out of the M.P. Act, in Devasahayam, this Court has held that so just is the above rule that in various rent control legislations such a ground is recognized and incorporated as a ground for eviction of a tenant either expressly or impliedly within the net of an act injurious to the interest of the landlord. It is further held that denial of landlord’s title or disclaimer of tenancy by tenant is an act which is likely to affect adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord. It is, therefore, covered by Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. The following observations of this Court in Devasahayam are relevant:

“27. In Sheela v. Prahlad Rai Prem Prakash[8] whereupon Mr. Nageswara Rao placed strong reliance, Lahoti, J., as the learned Chief Justice then was, while construing the provisions of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961 observed:

13. The law as to tenancy being determined by forfeiture by denial of the lessor’s title or disclaimer of the tenancy has been adopted in India from the law of England where it originated as a principle in consonance with justice, equity and good conscience. On enactment of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the same was incorporated into clause (g) of Section 111. So just is the rule that it has been held applicable even in the areas where the Transfer of Property Act does not apply. (See: Raja Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan v. Municipal Board of Sitapur[9].) The principle of determination of tenancy by forfeiture consequent upon denial of the lessor’s title may not be applicable where rent control legislation intervenes and such legislation while extending protection to tenants from eviction does not recognise such denial or disclaimer as a ground for termination of tenancy and eviction of tenant. However, in various rent control legislations such a ground is recognised and incorporated as a ground for eviction of tenant either expressly or impliedly by bringing it within the net of an act injurious to the interest of the landlord on account of its mischievous content to prejudice adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord.
… … … … … … … …
17. In our opinion, denial of landlord’s title or disclaimer of tenancy by tenant is an act which is likely to affect adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord and hence is a ground for eviction of tenant within the meaning of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961. To amount to such denial or disclaimer, as would entail forfeiture of tenancy rights and incur the liability to be evicted, the tenant should have renounced his character as tenant and in clear and unequivocal terms set up title of the landlord in himself or in a third party. A tenant bona fide calling upon the landlord to prove his ownership or putting the landlord to proof of his title so as to protect himself (i.e. the tenant) or to earn a protection made available to him by the rent control law but without disowning his character of possession over the tenancy premises as tenant cannot be said to have denied the title of landlord or disclaimed the tenancy. Such an act of the tenant does not attract applicability of Section 12(1)(c) abovesaid. It is the intention of the tenant, as culled out from the nature of the plea raised by him, which is determinative of its vulnerability.”
12. Having ascertained the legal position we will now state why we feel that the High Court is not right in disturbing the concurrent finding of fact that the respondent-tenant denied the title of the appellant-landlady.

13. There is a specific reference to the registered document under which the appellant purchased the suit building from the earlier landlord in the plaint. Yet, in the written statement the respondent denied the title of the appellant. We notice that there are several documents on record relating to the ownership of the appellant, apart from the registered sale deed, such as municipal tax receipts, ration card etc. Yet, the respondent refused to acknowledge the appellant’s title. He denied it in his evidence. This is not a simple case of denial of derivative title by a person who did not know about the purchase of the building by the landlord. Even after going through the relevant documents relating to the appellant’s title the respondent feigned ignorance about it. The High Court has accepted that in his cross-examination the respondent has stated that he was not accepting the appellant as his landlady. The High Court has, however, gone on to say that by this piece of evidence no decree of eviction can be passed against the respondent under Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act because the respondent will have no occasion to establish in what circumstances he denied the title of the appellant. The High Court has further held that the respondent was within permissible limit in asking the appellant to produce documentary evidence about his title as a landlord. The High Court, in our opinion, fell into a grave error in drawing such a conclusion. Even denial of a landlord’s title in the written statement can provide a ground for eviction of a tenant. It is also settled position in law that it is not necessary that the denial of title by the landlord should be anterior to the institution of eviction proceedings. This is so stated by this Court in Majati Subbarao v. P.V.K. Krishnarao(deceased) by LRs.[10].

14. The High Court has expressed that the respondent was justified in asking the appellant to produce the documents. Implicit in this observation is the High Court’s view that the respondent could have in an eviction suit got the title of the appellant finally adjudicated upon. There is a fallacy in this reasoning. In eviction proceedings the question of title to the properties in question may be incidentally gone into, but cannot be decided finally. Similar question fell for consideration of this Court in Bhagadi Kannabalu. In that case it was argued that the landlady was not entitled to inherit the properties in question and hence could not maintain the application for eviction on the ground of default and sub- letting under the A.P. Tenancy Act. This Court referred to its decision in Tej Bhan Madan v. II Additional District Judge and Ors.[11] in which it was held that a tenant was precluded from denying the title of the landlady on the general principle of estoppel between landlord and tenant and that this principle, in its basic foundations, means no more than that under certain circumstances law considers it unjust to allow a person to approbate and reprobate. Section 116 of the Evidence Act is clearly applicable to such a situation. This Court held that even if the landlady was not entitled to inherit the properties in question, she could still maintain the application for eviction and the finding of fact recorded by the courts below in favour of the landlady was not liable to be disturbed. The position on law was stated by this Court as under:

“In this connection, we may also point out that in an eviction petition filed on the ground of sub-letting and default, the court needs to decide whether relationship of landlord and tenant exists and not the question of title to the properties in question, which may be incidentally gone into, but cannot be decided finally in the eviction proceeding.”
15. Reliance placed by learned counsel for the respondent on Mohd. Nooman is misplaced. In that case, the landlord had filed an eviction suit described as Title Suit No.36 of 1973 to evict the tenant. The trial court held that the relationship of landlord and tenant had not been proved and since the tenant had raised the question of title the proper course would be to dismiss the suit and not to convert it into a declaratory suit because the suit was neither for declaration of title nor had the plaintiff paid ad valorem court fee. The trial court dismissed the suit as there was no landlord and tenant relationship, but, upheld the plaintiff’s claim of title. In the appeal, the first appellate court observed that by filing a suit for eviction and paying court fee on twelve months alleged rent, the plaintiff had adopted a tricky way of getting the title decided. The plaintiff, then, filed a suit on title. The trial court decreed the suit. The first appellate court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit. In the second appeal before the High Court the question was whether the judgment and decree regarding title passed in the earlier suit shall operate as res judicata between the parties on the question of title. The High Court observed that pleas taken by both parties regarding title in both the title suits are the same and answered the question in affirmative. This Court endorsed the High Court’s view and held that the issue of title was directly and substantially an issue between the parties in the earlier eviction suit, hence, the High Court was right in holding that the finding of title recorded in the earlier suit would operate as res judicata in the subsequent suit. This view was expressly restricted by this Court to the facts before it. This Court clarified that ordinarily it is true that in a suit for eviction even if the court goes into the question of title it examines the issue in an ancillary manner and in such cases (which constitute a very large majority) any observation or finding on the question of title would certainly not be binding in any subsequent suit on the dispute of title. This Court further clarified that the case with which it was dealing fell in an exceptional category of very limited number of cases. Thus, in our opinion, no parallel can be drawn from Mohd. Nooman. In that case issue of title was framed. In the instant case issue of title was not even framed. Mohd. Nooman arose out of exceptional facts and must be restricted to those facts.

16. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the High Court was wrong in setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the courts below that the respondent had denied the title of the appellant. We are of the view that the present case is covered by Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. It is, therefore, necessary to restore the decree of eviction. In the circumstances, we allow the appeal. The impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and eviction decree passed by the trial court and confirmed by the first appellate court under Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act is restored.",0
Dasan," In this appeal, judgment and order dated 17/1/2012 passed by the Kerala High Court confirming the appellant’s conviction under Section 326 of the Penal Code is under challenge. We have granted application for impleadment of Uddesh who was examined as PW-2 as he had suffered grievous injury at the hands of the appellant. He is, therefore, party to the present appeal.

3. The appellant is original Accused 1. He was tried along with seven others by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Thrissur in Criminal Complaint No.23 of 1997 for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324, 326 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code. Learned Magistrate convicted the appellant for offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code for having caused grievous hurt by dangerous weapon to PW- 2 Uddesh and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. The appellant was also ordered to pay Rs.25,000/- as compensation to PW-2 Uddesh. In default of payment of compensation, the appellant was to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. The appellant was, however, acquitted of all other charges. The other accused were acquitted of all the charges leveled against them. The appellant carried an appeal to the IIIrd Additional Sessions Judge, Thrissur. The Sessions Court dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved, the appellant filed Criminal Revision Petition No.1931 of 2004 before the High Court of Kerala. By the impugned judgment, the High Court while confirming the conviction of the appellant under Section 326 of the Penal Code, reduced the sentence to eighteen months rigorous imprisonment. However, the High Court increased the compensation awarded to PW-2 Uddesh by the trial court from Rs.25,000/- to Rs.1 lakh. In default, the appellant was ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment for fifteen months. After the impugned judgment, the appellant and PW-2 Uddesh have settled the case out of court amicably. Since the offence under Section 326 of the Penal Code is not a compoundable offence, the appellant has preferred this appeal urging that in view of the settlement, this Court should in exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India compound the offence.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have perused the written submissions filed by the appellant. There is no dispute about the fact that the appellant and PW-2 Uddesh have amicably settled their dispute. Their respective counsel have confirmed this fact. Application is filed by the appellant praying that the offence may be compounded. PW-2 Uddesh has filed his affidavit confirming that he and the appellant have amicably settled the case out of court and he has no objection to the compounding of the case.

5. Offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code is non- compoundable. There is no dispute about this. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that, in fact, the appellant cannot be convicted under Section 326 of the Penal Code because there is no consistent evidence that the appellant used any dangerous weapon. The evidence on record indicates that he used a stick. Therefore, the appellant could be punished only under Section 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt which is compoundable by the person to whom the hurt is caused with the permission of the court. Counsel submitted that in the circumstances, the conviction of the appellant under Section 326 of the Penal Code be converted into one under Section 325 of the Penal Code and the offence be compounded.

6. Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“the Code”) pertains to offences punishable under the Penal Code only. It states which offences can be compounded, by whom they can be compounded and which offences can be compounded only with the permission of the concerned court. Sub-sections 3 to 8 thereof further clarify how Section 320 of the Code operates. Sub- section 9 thereof states that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section. The legislative intent is, therefore, clear. Compounding has to be done strictly in accordance with Section 320 of the Code. No deviation from this provision is permissible.

7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab & Anr.,[1] this Court was considering the scope of Section 482 and Section 320 of the Code. This Court clarified that in compounding of offences, power of criminal court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in Section 320 of the Code and the court is guided solely and squarely thereby. This Court described the scope of Section 320 of the Code as under:

“51. Section 320 of the Code articulates public policy with regard to the compounding of offences. It catalogues the offences punishable under IPC which may be compounded by the parties without permission of the court and the composition of certain offences with the permission of the court. The offences punishable under the special statutes are not covered by Section 320. When an offence is compoundable under Section 320, abatement of such offence or an attempt to commit such offence or where the accused is liable under Section 34 or 149 IPC can also be compounded in the same manner. A person who is under 18 years of age or is an idiot or a lunatic is not competent to contract compounding of offence but the same can be done on his behalf with the permission of the court. If a person is otherwise competent to compound an offence is dead, his legal representatives may also compound the offence with the permission of the court. Where the accused has been committed for trial or he has been convicted and the appeal is pending, composition can only be done with the leave of the court to which he has been committed or with the leave of the appeal court, as the case may be. The Revisional Court is also competent to allow any person to compound any offence who is competent to compound. The consequence of the composition of an offence is acquittal of the accused. Sub-section (9) of Section 320 mandates that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section. Obviously, in view thereof the composition of an offence has to be in accord with Section 320 and in no other manner.”
8. It follows from the above discussion that since offence under Section 326 of the Penal Code is non-compoundable, permission to compound it, cannot be granted. We, however, find some substance in the submission of the appellant’s counsel that on the basis of the evidence adduced in this case, it cannot be said with certainty that the appellant used an iron rod to hit PW-2 Uddesh. Though at the trial, the witnesses stated that the appellant used an iron rod to assault PW-2 Uddesh, admittedly the iron rod is not recovered and what is recovered is MO1, a wooden stick. We notice from the judgment of the Sessions Court that the case of the prosecution was that the appellant struck a blow on PW-2 Uddesh with a wooden stick causing injury to his left eye. This story appears to have been not accepted by the courts below because the witnesses improved the story in the Court that an iron rod was used. It has also come on record that PW-2 Uddesh filed a civil suit against the appellant for compensation and in that suit, he alleged that the appellant beat him with a wooden stick. The Sessions Court has referred to this suit and particularly the plaint [Ex- D1] which contains the statement that PW-2 was beaten with a wooden stick by the appellant. In our opinion, in the circumstances, it cannot be said with certainty that the appellant used an iron rod to beat the appellant. In such a situation, we are inclined to accept the version which is favourable to the appellant. In the circumstances, in our opinion, the appellant’s conviction under Section 326 of the Penal Code needs to be converted into one under Section 325 of the Penal Code. We accordingly, convert the conviction of the appellant from one under Section 326 of the Penal Code to one under Section 325 of the Penal Code. Offence under Section 325 of the Penal Code is compoundable by the person to whom the hurt is caused with the permission of the court. The question is whether in this case, permission to compound the offence should be granted because PW-2 Uddesh to whom the hurt is caused has made a request to this Court that offence be compounded.

9. In Ram Shanker & Ors. v. State of U.P.,[2] the complainant and the accused had settled the criminal case and an application was made for compounding the offence. The accused were convicted for offence under Section 307 of the Penal Code. This Court converted the conviction of the appellant from one under Section 307 of the Penal Code to that of an offence under Section 325 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code. Permission to compound the offence was granted and the appellants therein were acquitted.

10. Having converted the appellant’s conviction into one under Section 325 of the Penal Code, we are inclined to follow the course adopted by this Court in Ram Shanker and grant permission to compound the offence. The offence was committed on 24/8/1996. Eighteen long years have passed thereafter. The appellant and PW-2 Uddesh who suffered the grievous injury have compromised the case. They wish to accord a quietus to their disputes. We, therefore, grant permission to compound the offence under Section 325 of the Penal Code to the appellant and PW-2 Uddesh, who is added as respondent 2 herein. The offence under Section 325 of the Penal Code is compounded. The impugned judgment is set aside. The appellant Dasan is acquitted. He is on bail. His bail bond stands cancelled. The appeal is disposed of.

VINOD KUMAR,"These appeals are filed by the appellant questioning the correctness of the judgment and final Order dated 05.04.2011 passed in C.W.P. No. 7746 of 2009 and order dated 16.12.2011 passed in Review Application No. 388 of 2011 by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, urging various facts and legal contentions in justification of his claim.

3. Necessary relevant facts are stated hereunder to appreciate the case of the appellant and also to find out whether the appellant is entitled for the relief as prayed in this appeal.

The appellant is the owner of 5 Kanals 6 Marlas of land out of which 934 square yards have been left out of acquisition. On 07.02.2008, under the Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977, the Haryana Urban Development Authority issued a notice for acquisition of land including that of the appellant for public purpose namely, for the development and utilization of the land as residential and commercial purposes. The notification was issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short ‘the Act’) and the Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate, Faridabad, Haryana was authorized to issue public notice on the substance of notification at convenient places in the locality. He was also authorized to survey upon the land and take necessary action regarding the same. The appellant filed a detailed objection under Section 5A of the Act categorically stating that the appellant has raised an A Class construction on the concerned area in the year 1999-2000 and therefore, inclusion of the land for the purpose of acquisition is not justified. In the meanwhile, on 10.03.2008, the said land was released by the Authority in favour of Ritwiz Builders and Developers Pvt. Ltd. However, on 15.09.2008, the Land Acquisition Collector considered the objection filed by the appellant under Section 5A of the Act and as per his report, exempted the land of the appellant from acquisition since there was already a residential building on the land on the date of the notification. In spite of the report produced by the Land Acquisition Collector, the Haryana Urban Development Authority vide notification dated 06.02.2009 made a declaration that the appellant’s land is to be acquired for the development of residential and commercial Sector Nos. 76,77 and 78 for which the notification was initially issued on 07.02.2008.

4. It is the case of the appellant that while issuing the notification under Section 6 of the Act, the property adjoining to the land of the appellant, which belongs to one M/s. Harpreet Food, was released. Though the respondent Authority has released a portion of the appellant’s property, some part of the built-up and constructed portion of the house was not released.

5. The appellant therefore, filed a writ petition before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana registered as Writ Petition No. 7746 of 2009, challenging the acquisition of his land by the Authority. The said petition got tagged along with other similar petitions filed by different affected parties and the Writ Petition No. 7711 of 2009, titled New Vidya Niketan Educational Society Vs. State of Haryana & Ors. was made the lead case.

6. The High Court, after hearing both the parties concluded that in all the writ petitions, construction was raised in an unauthorized manner without getting any permission either under the provisions of the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, 1963 or under the relevant Municipal laws. Even then in some cases, relief was granted by releasing some portion of the land under construction and ordering acquisition of vacant land. The action taken by the Authority was held perfectly justified. The Review Application No. 388 of 2011 filed by the appellant against dismissal of his C.W.P. No. 7746 of 2009 was also dismissed on 16.12.2011. Hence, these appeals.

7. The learned senior counsel Mr. Pallav Sisodia, appearing on behalf of the appellant argued that the High Court failed to appreciate that there was a construction already made by the appellant for residential purpose. Therefore, as per the policy of the Government of Haryana, the constructed portion including the amenities and other built up areas are required to be released from the process of acquisition. It is the further case of the appellant that the High Court erred in not appreciating the fact that the Land Acquisition Collector in his report has mentioned that the land of the appellant may not be acquired since it has a well–laiden beautiful residence. The State Government, as per the learned senior counsel, illegally and in an unauthorized manner, has acquired the land. It is also the case of the appellant that in a different case having similar facts, the High Court has passed an Order releasing the lands over which built up houses were situated. The learned senior counsel of the appellant further argues that the Government has adopted the ‘pick and choose’ methodology for acquiring land thereby exempting the commercial establishments from acquisition and discriminating against the appellant.

8. The learned Additional Advocate General Mr. Manjit Singh, appearing on behalf of the State contended that the appellant had illegally raised construction on this land without permission of the concerned authority. Hence, the appellant cannot now seek exemption from acquisition on the ground that there is a residential construction on the land and therefore, the land cannot be acquired.

9. We are inclined to observe that the High Court has erred in dismissing the writ petition of the appellant as the same is contrary to the principle laid down by this Court in the following cases :-

In Kamal Trading (P) Ltd. v. State of West Bengal[1], it has been held as under:-

“14. It must be borne in mind that the proceedings under the LA Act are based on the principle of eminent domain and Section 5- A is the only protection available to a person whose lands are sought to be acquired. It is a minimal safeguard afforded to him by law to protect himself from arbitrary acquisition by pointing out to the authority concerned, inter alia, that the important ingredient, namely, ""public purpose"" is absent in the proposed acquisition or the acquisition is mala fide. The LA Act being an expropriatory legislation, its provisions will have to be strictly construed.
15. Hearing contemplated under Section 5-A(2) is necessary to enable the Collector to deal effectively with the objections raised against the proposed acquisition and make a report. The report of the Collector referred to in this provision is not an empty formality because it is required to be placed before the appropriate Government together with the Collector's recommendations and the record of the case. It is only upon receipt of the said report that the Government can take a final decision on the objections. It is pertinent to note that declaration under Section 6 has to be made only after the appropriate Government is satisfied on the consideration of the report, if any, made by the Collector under Section 5-A(2). As said by this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd., the appropriate Government while issuing declaration under Section 6 of the LA Act is required to apply its mind not only to the objections filed by the owner of the land in question, but also to the report which is submitted by the Collector upon making such further inquiry thereon as he thinks necessary and also the recommendations made by him in that behalf.
16. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the LA Act makes a declaration under Section 6 conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose. Formation of opinion by the appropriate Government as regards the public purpose must be preceded by application of mind as regards consideration of relevant factors and rejection of irrelevant ones. It is, therefore, that the hearing contemplated under Section 5-A and the report made by the Land Acquisition Officer and his recommendations assume importance. It is implicit in this provision that before making declaration under Section 6 of the LA Act, the State Government must have the benefit of a report containing recommendations of the Collector submitted under Section 5A(2) of the LA Act. The recommendations must indicate objective application of mind.” (Emphasis laid by this Court) In the case of Usha Stud and Agricultural Farms Pvt. Ltd. v.
State of Haryana[2], it was held as under:

“30…..Section 6(1) provides that if the appropriate Government is satisfied, after considering the report, if any, made by the Collector under Section 5-A(2) that particular land is needed for the specified public purpose then a declaration should be made. This necessarily implies that the State Government is required to apply mind to the report of the Collector and take final decision on the objections filed by the landowners and other interested persons. Then and then only, a declaration can be made under Section 6(1).” (Emphasis laid by this Court) Further, in the case of Women’s Education Trust and Anr. v.
State of Haryana & Ors.[3], this Court has held as under:-

“20. What is most surprising is that the High Court did not even deal with the issue relating to application of mind by the Government to the report submitted by the Land Acquisition Collector under Section 5A(2) along with his recommendations.
The documents produced before the High Court and this Court do not show that the State Government had objectively applied mind to the recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector and felt satisfied that the land in question deserves to be acquired for the purpose specified in the notification issued under Section 4(1). The record also does not contain any indication as to why the State Government did not consider it proper to accept the recommendations of the Land Acquisition Collector. Therefore, there is no escape from the conclusion that the impugned acquisition is ultra vires the provisions contained in Section 6 of the Act.” (Emphasis laid by this Court) Also, in an earlier case in Shyam Nandan Prasad & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors.[4], this Court observed that compliance of Section 5A of the Act is a sine qua non for acquisition of land. This Court held that:

“10.…..The decision of the Collector is supposedly final unless the appropriate Government chooses to interfere therein and cause affectation, suo motu or on the application of any person interested in the land. These requirements obviously lead to the positive conclusion that the proceeding before the Collector is a blend of public and individual enquiry. The person interested, or known to be interested, in the land is to be served personally of the notification, giving him the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right. That the objection is to be in writing, is indicative of the fact that the enquiry into the objection is to focus his individual cause as well as public cause…..”
10. In the light of the foregoing cases, it is evident that the government has to consider the report of the Land Acquisition Collector while making declaration of acquisition of land under Section 6 of the Act. Further, if the government is coming to a conclusion which is contrary to the report, then the government has to provide appropriate reason for the same. The report of Land Acquisition Collector is extracted hereunder:-

11. Hence, the declaration made by the Government for acquisition of land of the appellant under Section 6 of the Act does not provide any reason for arriving at a decision contrary to that of the report produced by the Land Acquisition Collector. Therefore, the basic protection to which the landowners are entitled to under the Act through Section 5A is violated. Consequently, the process of acquisition of the land of the appellant is tainted with mala-fide and therefore, the same is liable to be set aside. Accordingly, the impugned acquisition notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act in relation to the appellant’s land and the action taken thereon are hereby quashed. The impugned judgment and orders of the High Court are set aside. The appeals are allowed. No costs.",0
Surjit Kaur Gill & Anr,"This appeal seeks to challenge the judgment and order dated 27.1.2009 rendered by a Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in FAO (OS) No.290 of 2008 whereby the Division Bench has set aside in part the decision rendered by a learned Single Judge who had dismissed the application moved by the respondent No.1 (defendant No.1) under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 by his judgment and order dated 7th April, 2008.

(2) Heard Mr. Shyam Diwan learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Mr. C.A. Sundaram learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents.

(3) The brief facts leading to this appeal are that one Ajit Singh filed a Suit bearing No.2167 of 1993, on the Original Side of Delhi High Court for partition of property against his sister Ms. Adarsh Kaur Gill and some others. He filed the suit in his capacity as the Administrator of the Will of his deceased sister Smt. Abnash Kaur. The prayers in the suit were as follows:

(a) pass a preliminary decree of partition of the property bearing No.3, South end Road, New Delhi, more particularly shown on the plan, and thereafter, pass a final decree partitioning the said property by metes and bounds and put each of the parties to the suit in actual physical possession of the portion of the property allotted to him/her. If the partition of the property by metes and bounds is not feasible, then the property may ordered to be sold by public auction through Court and proceeds thereof be divided between the parties to the suit in accordance with their share and entitlement;
(b) pass a preliminary decree for partition of the movable assets belonging to the estate of Smt. Abnash Kaur, as mentioned in the Schedule to the plaint and, thereafter, pass a final decree and give to each of the party to the suit his/her share of the said property. In case it is not feasible to distribute the movable assets belonging to the estate of Smt. Abnash Kaur in the hands of defendants Nos.1 & 2 to each of the beneficiaries, as per the share and entitlement, then the said movable assets may be ordered to be sold by public auction through this Hon'ble Court and the proceeds thereto may be divided amongst the parties, as per their share and entitlement;
(c) pass a decree for rendition of accounts and enquiry into the same with respect to the rental income of the property received by defendant No.1 from the tenant of property bearing No.3, South End Road, New Delhi, w.e.f. 1.1.1980 to 30.11.1990;
(d) pass a decree for rendition of accounts and enquiry into the same with respect to the profits made by defendant Nos.1 and 2 from the business which they have been carrying on by investing the funds from the estate of Smt. Abnash Kaur;
(e) Pass a decree for declaration that there has been no lease deed executed by Smt. Abnash Kaur in favour of Defendant No.1 and that defendant No.1 is not a lessee in the property, 3, South End Road, New Delhi, and she is not entitled to give the said property to any person on sub-lease basis;
(f) pass a decree of declaration to the effect that defendant No.1 is not a subrogatee of the mortgage deeds executed by late Smt. Abnash Kaur with respect to the property in favour of Smt. Sushila Daphtary and her son Mr. Anil Daphtary said mortgage deeds have been redeemed out of the estate left by Smt. Abnash Kaur;
(g) Pass a decree of declaration to the effect that defendants Nos.1 & 2 have dis-entitled themselves from getting any share in the estate left by Smt. Abnash Kaur and that the plaintiff and defendants Nos.3, 4 & 5 are the only beneficiaries under the Will of Smt. Abnash Kaur and are entitled to get the entire estate left by Smt. Abnash Kaur divided and partitioned in four equal shares;
(h) Pass a decree for permanent injunction against Defendant No./1 restraining her permanently from transferring, alienating, letting out or parting with the possession of the property No.3, South End Road, New Delhi, or any part thereof and from making any additions and alterations in the same in any manner whatsoever;
(i) Any relief which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case may also be granted to the plaintiff and other beneficiaries under the Will of Smt. Abnash Kaur; and
(j) Cost of the Suit may also be awarded against defendants Nos.1 and
2.
(4) There is no dispute that after the suit was filed issues have been framed and at a later stage the plaintiff had tendered his affidavit in lieu of the examination-in-chief. It is at that stage that the application made under Order VII Rule 11 (though made earlier), came to be pressed into service and decided by the learned Single Judge. The contention on behalf of the respondent-defendant was that as can be seen from the statements in the plaint, the suit was barred by law, and therefore it ought to be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 sub-clause (d). The learned Single Judge went into the issues and came to the conclusion that all the prayers were inter-connected, and they were related essentially to the principal prayer

(a) for partition of the property of deceased Smt.Abnash Kaur on the basis of the Will which she had executed.The learned Single Judge relied upon the dicta of this Court in Popat and Kotecha Property vs. State Bank of India Staff Association reported in (2005) 7 SCC 510 which held that the plaint without addition or subtraction must show that it is barred by any law to attract application of Order 7 Rule 11. The language of various paragraphs in the plaint and the pleadings have to be seen in their entirety to ascertain its terms. The application was, therefore, dismissed by the learned Judge by his judgment and order dated 7.4.2008.

(5) Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order an appeal was preferred to the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, and the Division Bench by the impugned judgment and order has allowed that appeal in part. It has allowed the application moved by the respondent No.1 under Order 7 Rule 11 to the extent of prayer clauses (b) to (f) as time barred. Being aggrieved by that judgment this appeal has been filed.

(6) Mr. Diwan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants pointed out that all the abovereferred prayers are inter related, and they are essentially concerning the partition which the original plaintiff was seeking. The original plaintiff having died, the appellant has transposed herself as the appellant. He pointed out that the estate was essentially of Smt.Abnash Kaur who had received it from her husband, and there were disputes between her step sons and herself, and to protect the property certain arrangements had been made amongst the siblings of Smt. Abnhash Kaur. It is as a result of that arrangement that a lease deed was executed by Smt. Abnash Kaur in favour of the respondent No.1 herein. Similarly various other arrangements were made with the understanding of all the family members. It was in 1992 that the respondent, for the first time, resiled from all those arrangements and understanding, and that is how it became necessary for the original plaintiff to file the suit. The suit filed in 1993 was well within time and the prayers therein could not be segregated.

(7) Mr. C.A. Sundaram learned senior counsel, on the other hand, took us through the various prayers of the suit, particularly the prayers (b) to (f). As far as prayer (b) is concerned he pointed out that this prayer seeks the partition of the movable assets belonging to said Smt Abnash Kaur. Smt Abnash Kaur died in 1976 and therefore this prayer is time barred under Article 69 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 since this claim is not made within three years therefrom. In respect of prayer clause(c), he pointed out that the accounts are sought with respect to the rental income for the period from 1.1.80 to 30.11.90 and since the suit is filed in September, 1993, at the highest the claim could be maintainable for the last four months, and the claim for the earlier period would be time barred under Article 69 of the Limitation Act. With respect to prayer clause (d), though he opposed the inclusion of the prayer in the plaint, he very fairly stated that perhaps this prayer could have been allowed by the Division Bench.

(8) His main objection was to prayer clauses (e) and (f) which according to him, the Division Bench has rightly struck off. According to him they contained separate causes of action. The prayer clause (e) seeks a declaration that there has been no lease deed executed by Smt Abnash Kaur in favour of the defendant No.1, and that she was not the lessee of the concerned property situated at 3, South end Road, New Delhi and that she was not entitled to give the property to any other person on sub-lease basis. Mr. C.A. Sundaram submitted that in the Will itself it is pointed out that the lease has been given to the respondent No.1 herein, and this was all to the knowledge of the plaintiff, and therefore the said declaration could not be sought by filing a suit in 1993. It would be barred under Article 58 of the Limitation Act. With reference to prayer clause (f) which seeks a declaration that the defendant No.1 is not a subrogatee in respect of the mortgage deed executed by Smt. Abnash Kaur with respect to the property in favour of Smt. Shushila Daphtary and Mr. Anil Daphtary, Mr.C.A. Sundaram submitted that, this transaction had taken place on 20.2.78 and that being so, again the prayer would be hit by Article 59 of the Limitation Act.

(9) with respect to these submission, Mr. Diwan pointed out that in fact there is a clear writing of the respondent No.1 herein executed on 12.2.91 which clearly states, amongst others, in paragraph (d) that she will not claim any tenancy right or charge on the above referred property. In paragraph (b) of that writing she agreed to render the accounts with respect to the rental income received from 1.1.80 to 30.11.90. In paragraph (c) of that writing she states that with respect to the two mortgages redeemed in her name, she will not claim any charge as the amounts paid for redeeming the said mortgages were paid from the estaste of Smt. Abnash Kaur. Mr. Diwan states that after executing this writing, the disputes between the parties were supposed to get settled, but then unfortunately it did not happen. The respondent No.1 started construction on the particular property in her own right. This having happened in 1992, the original plaintiff was constrained to file the suit for the partition of the property belonging to Smt.Abnash Kaur. Smt. Abnash Kaur having made a Will about her property, the original plaintiff had to see to it as the administrator of the will that the property is distributed in accordance therewith. This being the position, in his submission it is Article 58 which is the relevant Article for all these prayers, which provides for a period of 3 years when the right to sue first accrues. In the present case, it will be when the dispute arose because of the conduct of the respondent No.1 herein. The issue of limitation is always a mixed question of facts and law, and therefore, it could not be held that no case was made out for proceeding for a trial. Mr. C.A. Sundaram submitted that the respondent No.1 disputed the writing dated 12.2.1991, and it had to be forensically tested. This submission all the more justifies that the trial had to proceed. For deciding an application under Order 7 rule 11, one has to look at the plaint and decide whether it deserved to be rejected for the ground raised. In our view, the view taken by the Division Bench is clearly erroneous. The appeal is therefore allowed and the judgment and order of the Division Bench is set aside. The application made under Order 7 Rule 11 moved by the respondent No.1 herein will stand rejected. We may however clarify that all the observations herein are only for the purpose of deciding this appeal.",0
T.S. Shylaja,"The short question that falls for consideration in this appeal is whether the High Court was justified in setting aside the order passed by the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation holding the appellant entitled to an amount of Rs.4,48,000/- towards compensation with interest @ 12% per annum.

3. The claim before the Commissioner arose out of a motor accident in which the deceased-Prahlad lost his life while driving a Toyota Qualis vehicle bearing registration No.KA-02/C-423. The incident in question, it appears, occurred on 3rd September 2000 near Bidadi Police Station, on the Bangalore-Mysore highway involving a head on collision with a Tipper Lorry bearing No.KA-02-B-9135. The deceased was removed to the hospital where he died two days after the accident. A claim petition was then filed before the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation, Bangalore Sub-Division-IV, Bangalore by the appellant, mother of the deceased for payment of compensation. The claim petition alleged that the deceased was employed as a driver on a monthly salary of Rs.6,000/- by the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle being insured with the respondent-company, the claimant sought recovery of the amount from the company in terms of provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923, now re-christened as the Employee’s Compensation Act, 1923. The insurance company contested the claim primarily on the ground that the jural relationship of employer and employee did not exist between the owner and the deceased. It was also contended that it was the negligence of the deceased that had caused the accident thereby disentitling the claimant to any compensation.

4. On the pleadings of the parties, the Commissioner framed six issues for determination and eventually came to the conclusion that the deceased was indeed working as a paid driver of the owner of the vehicle, Toyota Qualis and that the claimant, the appellant herein was entitled to receive an amount of Rs.4,48,000/- towards compensation having regard to the fact that the deceased was just about 20 years of age at the time of accident and was receiving Rs.4,000/- per month towards salary. An award for the said amount was accordingly made by the Commissioner with interest @12% per annum against the respondent-company who had admittedly underwritten the risk in terms of a policy issued by it.

5. Aggrieved by the award made by the Commissioner, the respondent- company preferred an appeal, M.F.A. No. 738 of 2009 before the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore which has been allowed by a Single Judge of that Court in terms of the order impugned order before us. The High Court was of the view that the relationship between the deceased and his brother the owner of the vehicle he was driving was not satisfactorily proved to be that of an employee and an employer and that the only remedy which the appellant, mother of the deceased had, was by way of a claim for payment of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act.

6. Appearing for the appellant Mr. G.V. Chandrashekhar, learned counsel, strenuously argued that the High Court was in error in entertaining the appeal and in reversing the view taken by the Commissioner by re-appraising the evidence on record. He urged that the High Court remained oblivious of the provisions of Section 30(1) of the Act which clearly stipulate that no appeal shall lie against any order of the Commissioner unless a substantial question of law fell for consideration. No such question of law arose for consideration nor was the same framed or addressed by the High Court in the course of the judgment. The reasoning given by the High Court was, according to the learned counsel, vague and based entirely on surmises and conjectures hence unsustainable in law.

7. Section 30 of the Employees Compensation Act, 1923 no doubt provides for an appeal to the High Court from the orders passed by the Commissioner and enumerated in clauses (a) to (e) sub-Section (1) of Section 30. Proviso to Section 30(1), however, makes it abundantly clear that no such appeal shall lie unless a substantial question of law is involved in the appeal and in the case of an order other than an order such as is referred to in clause (b) unless the amount in dispute in the appeal is not less than three hundred rupees. Section 30(1) reads as under:

“30. Appeals.— (1) An appeal shall lie to the High Court from the following orders of a Commissioner, namely:—
(a) an order as awarding as compensation a lump sum whether by way of redemption of a half-monthly payment or otherwise or disallowing a claim in full or in part for a lump sum;
1[(aa) an order awarding interest or penalty under section 4A;]
(b) an order refusing to allow redemption of a half-monthly payment;
(c) an order providing for the distribution of compensation among the dependants of a deceased workman, or disallowing any claim of a person alleging himself to be such dependant;
(d) an order allowing or disallowing any claim for the amount of an indemnity under the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 12; or
(e) an order refusing to register a memorandum of agreement or registering the same or providing for the registration of the same subject to conditions:
Provided that no appeal shall lie against any order unless a substantial question of law is involved in the appeal, and in the case of an order other than an order such as is referred to in clause (b), unless the amount in dispute in the appeal is not less than three hundred rupees:
Provided further that no appeal shall lie in any case in which the parties have agreed to abide by the decision of the Commissioner, or in which the order of the Commissioner gives effect to an agreement come to by the parties:
Provided further that no appeal by an employer under clause (a) shall lie unless the memorandum of appeal is accompanied by a certificate by the Commissioner to the effect that the appellant has deposited with him the amount payable under the order appealed against.”
8. What is important is that in terms of the 1st proviso, no appeal is maintainable against any order passed by the Commissioner unless a substantial question of law is involved. This necessarily implies that the High Court would in the ordinary course formulate such a question or at least address the same in the judgment especially when the High Court takes a view contrary to the view taken by the Commissioner.

9. The Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation had, in the case at hand, appraised the evidence adduced before him and recorded a finding of fact that the deceased was indeed employed as a driver by the owner of the vehicle no matter the owner happened to be his brother. That finding could not be lightly interfered with or reversed by the High Court. The High Court overlooked the fact that the respondent-owner of the vehicle had appeared as a witness and clearly stated that the deceased was his younger brother, but was working as a paid driver under him. The Commissioner had, in this regard, observed:

“After examining the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court relied upon by 2nd opponent it is seen that the owner of the vehicle being the sole witness has been unsuccessful in establishing his case but in this proceeding the owner of the vehicle has appeared before this Court even though he is a relative of the deceased, and has submitted in his objections, even evidence that even though the deceased was his younger brother he was working as a driver under him, and has admitted that he was paying salary to him. The applicant in support of his case has submitted Hon’ble High Court judgment reported in ILR 2006 KAR 518. The Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Yellappa Bheemappa Alagudi & Ors. which I have examined in depth which holds that there is no law that relatives cannot be in employer employee relationship. Therefore it is no possible to ignore the oral and documentary evidence in favour of the applicant and such evidence has to be weighed in favour of the applicant. For these reasons I hold that the deceased was working as driver under first opponent and driving Toyota Quails No.KA-02-C-423, that he died in accident on 03.09.2005, that he is a ‘workman’ as defined in the Workmen’s Compensation Act and it is held that he has caused accident in the course of employment in a negligent fashion which has resulted in his death”.
10. The only reason which the High Court has given to upset the above finding of the Commissioner is that the Commissioner could not blindly accept the oral evidence without analysing the documentary evidence on record. We fail to appreciate as to what was the documentary evidence which the High Court had failed to appreciate and what was the contradiction, if any, between such documents and the version given by the witnesses examined before the Commissioner. The High Court could not have, without adverting to the documents vaguely referred to by it have upset the finding of fact which the Commissioner was entitled to record. Suffice it to say that apart from appreciation of evidence adduced before the Commissioner the High Court has neither referred to nor determined any question of law much less a substantial question of law existence whereof was a condition precedent for the maintainability of any appeal under Section 30. Inasmuch as the High court remained oblivious of the basic requirement of law for the maintainability of an appeal before it and inasmuch as it treated the appeal to be one on facts it committed an error which needs to be corrected",1
Donthula Ravindranath,"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No.203 of 2005 dated 5th June 2007. By the said judgment, the High Court confirmed the judgment dated 8th February 2005 in Sessions Case No.23 of 2004 on the file of the V-Addl. Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court) at Nizamabad.

2. The sole appellant herein alongwith his parents was tried for the offences under section 304B and 498A IPC. Apart from that the appellant herein was tried for an offence under section 302 IPC simplicitor while all the three persons were charged and tried for the offence under section 302 read with section 109 IPC. While the sole appellant herein was convicted for the offence under section 302 as well as section 498A IPC, the trial court did not record any finding against the appellant herein insofar as the charge under section 304B IPC is concerned. The other two accused were acquitted of all the charges.

3. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the appellant carried the matter in appeal to the High Court unsuccessfully. Hence the present appeal.

4. The wife of the appellant by name Jyotsna died on 21st May 2003. The deceased Jyotsna and the appellant married sometime in 1998, therefore, the death of Jyotsna took place within seven years from the date of marriage. The prosecution case rested on the circumstantial evidence. The prosecution relied on five circumstances to establish the guilt of the appellant herein, they are — (i) the deceased and the appellant were wife and husband; (ii) they were living in the same house; (iii) the deceased was harassed by the appellant for additional dowry; (iv) according to the medical evidence though the body was allegedly found hanging it was infact a case of strangulation; and lastly an extra-judicial confession was made by A-1 before PW9.

5. To establish the above circumstances the prosecution examined as many as 16 witnesses. PW1, PW2 and PW4 are the parents and brother of the deceased respectively. PW5 and PW6 are neighbours and PW7 is a resident of the locality who according to the prosecution saw the dead body hanging by a lungi to the roof. PW14 is the doctor who conducted post mortem examination on the dead body on 22.5.2003. PW15 is the Sub-Inspector of Police/Station House Officer attached to the V-Town Police Station, Nizamabad, Andhra Pradesh, who initially registered a crime under section 304B IPC on the report (Ex.P1) made by PW1. PWs1, 2 and 4 were examined to prove the factum of harassment for dowry by the appellant herein. PW3 is the husband of the sister of the deceased who was also examined for the purpose of establishing the harassment for dowry. Their evidence remains unimpeached and both the courts below believed their version insofar as the appellant is concerned.

6. PW7 is a resident of the locality where the appellant and the deceased lived. According to the prosecution, he went to the appellant’s house at 8.30 a.m. on the fateful day in order to collect some amount due from A-1. There he found the deceased hanging by a lungi to the roof on the first floor of the building. With the hope of saving the life, PW7 disentangled the dead body and laid it on the floor only to find that the lady was already dead. Thereafter, he alongwith the help of another person Bhumaiah (who is not examined) shifted the dead body to the ground floor of the building.

7. According to the evidence of PW1, some unknown person had informed by telephone on the fateful day in the morning hours that the deceased was ill. Thereafter, PW1 passed on the information to PW4, who was residing in the same town (Nizamabad) as the appellant and the deceased, and asked him to ascertain the state of affairs. Thereafter, PW1 along with other members of the family rushed to Nizamabad only to find the dead body of his daughter.

8. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that there is no iota of evidence to establish that the appellant caused the death of Jyotsna. He submitted that even if the offence under section 498A is proved in the absence of any clinching evidence that the appellant caused the death of Jyotsna it would not be safe to convict the appellant for the offence under section 302 IPC as the requirement of criminal law is that the prosecution must establish the guilt of accused beyond all reasonable doubt and in a case of circumstantial evidence the chain of circumstances is so complete that they collectively point only to the guilt of the accused without leaving any scope for doubt. The learned counsel made elaborate submissions impeaching the credibility of the evidence of PW14 the doctor who conducted the post mortem examination. PW14 opined that the cause of death is “shock due to asphyxia on account of strangulation”. The learned counsel relied upon various passages from Modi’s Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence in a bid to establish that having regard to the nature of the external injuries on the body of the deceased, the death of Jyotsna is a result of hanging but not strangulation thereby creating doubt about the credibility of the prosecution case.

9. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the State argued that the concurrent finding of fact resulting in the conviction of the appellant under section 302 IPC may not be interfered with in the absence of any illegality in the judgment under appeal.

10. We must at the outset state that one of the five circumstances relied upon by the prosecution to establish the guilt of the appellant i.e. the alleged extra-judicial confession made by the appellant before PW9 is disbelieved by the High Court. Therefore, only four circumstances remain, they are: (i) the appellant and the deceased were husband and wife; and (ii) they were living in the same house. These facts are not even disputed by the appellant. The third circumstance relied upon by the prosecution is that the deceased was harassed by the appellant for additional dowry. The said circumstance is abundantly established by the evidence of PW1 to PW4.

The fourth circumstance that the death of Jyotsna in the opinion[1] of the doctor was caused by strangulation (we do not propose to examine the correctness of the opinion) even if believed need not, in our opinion, lead to the conclusion that it is only the accused who must be held responsible for such strangulation. The building in which the accused and the deceased were living consists of four portions where others were also living.

Even if we give the benefit of the above mentioned doubt to the appellant, the appellant cannot escape his liability for a charge under section 304B IPC which creates a legal fiction. All the ingredients of section 304B are satisfied in the instant case, that the death of Jyotsna occurred within seven years of her marriage the death occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances and that Jyotsna was subjected to harassment which amounted to cruelty within the meaning of section 498A IPC of which charge the appellant is also found guilty by both the courts below",1
Shivshankar Gurgar,"The appellant filed civil suit under section 12(1)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) for eviction of the respondent and recovery of arrears of rent. On 16.4.2002 the suit came to be decreed ex parte. The said decree came to be set-aside on an application filed by the respondent with a direction to file the written statement and also deposit the entire arrears within 30 days in the court.

3. On 25.7.2004 a compromise memo signed by both the parties came to be filed under which the respondent acknowledged his liability to pay arrears of rent to the appellant to the tune of Rs.11710/- and also costs quantified to Rs.4000/-. The respondent also agreed to pay the amount within a period of six months. It was also specifically agreed as follows:

“H. If the defendant violates any of the aforesaid conditions, the plaintiff shall be entitled to get the vacant possession of suit accommodation from the defendant wherein defendant shall have no objection.”
4. In view of the said compromise, the matter was referred to the lok adalat and the civil suit was decreed in terms of the compromise.

5. On 21.7.2005 the appellant filed an application for the execution of the compromise decree alleging that the respondent failed to fulfil his obligations arising out of the compromise decree and, therefore, the appellant is entitled to recover possession of the premises. The events that followed are narrated by the High Court in the judgment under appeal as follows– “On 04/10/2005 after appearance respondent filed objections wherein it was alleged that signatures were obtained by the petitioner on the said compromise under undue influence and no receipt was issued by the petitioner for a sum of Rs.10,000/-, which was paid by the respondent. The said application was dismissed by the learned Executing Court vide order dated 24/10/2005 and it was directed that since the Executing Court cannot go behind the decree, therefore, warrant of possession be issued. Again on 09/11/2005 objections were filed in which adjustment of Rs.25,000/- was claimed. Vide order dated 22/11/2005 objections filed by the respondent was dismissed, however 15 days time was granted to deposit the amount. Since the amount was deposited by the respondent, therefore, vide order dated 23/12/2005 Executing Court dismissed the execution holding that since the relief of possession of suit accommodation was in alternate and the respondent has deposited the amount though belatedly, therefore, petitioner is not entitled for alternative relief and the execution petitioner was dismissed, against which an appeal was filed on 07/01/2006 and vide order dated 16/03/2006 learned Appellate Court held that the Executing Court has no jurisdiction to go behind the decree but no relief was granted to the petitioner against which Writ Petition was filed by the petitioner on 05/02/2006, which was numbered as WP No.6163/06 and vide order dated 08.02.2007 Writ Petition was allowed and the matter was remanded to the Executing Court with direction to decide the points framed by the Writ Court for determination.” (emphasis supplied)

6. The operative part of the order reads as follows:

“10. It is for this reason, I am constrained to remand the case to executing court for deciding the issue again arising out of the execution application filed by the petitioner. The executing court will decide the application keeping in view the law laid down in Nai Bahu[1] case and any other case which governs the field and will record categorical finding on following issues:
1. Whether compromise decree dated 25.7.2005 is nullity in so far as it relates to a relief of eviction of respondent from the suit house?
2. If not then whether default alleged is made out by the petitioner so as to entitle him to execute the decree for eviction?
7. On remand, by the order dated 17.4.2007, the executing court recorded a finding that the respondent had paid the entire amount due under the compromise decree in the executing court although such a payment was made beyond the period of six months stipulated in the compromise decree. Further, the executing court examined the submission made by the respondent that in view of section 13(1)(a) of the Act the compromise decree insofar as it provided for eviction of the respondent in the event of his failure to make the deposit of arrears within the stipulated time is void. The operative portion of the order of the executing court reads as follows:

“20. …. Hence, in respect of issue No.A it is decided that the compromise decree is void in respect of eviction relief and no such eviction can be ordered contrary to the provisions of M.P. Accommodation Control Act for default in payment of rent. Since executable part of compromise decree has been held to be void, in such circumstances the executing court cannot pass an order for eviction for default in payment of arrears of rent or remaining part of arrears of rent. Accordingly issue No.B is decided.”
8. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant herein again approached the High Court by way of a Civil Revision Petition No.173 of 2007. The High Court by its judgment under appeal dated 28.10.2010 dismissed the revision. Hence this appeal.

9. The reasons recorded by the High Court are as follows-

“8. Undoubtedly entire rent was deposited by the respondent. It is also not in dispute that the amount was not deposited within a period of six months as per terms and condition of the compromise decree. However, later on the rent was deposited. Since the ground was available to the petitioner under Section 12(1)(a) of M.P. Accommodation Control Act as the respondent did not tender the rent within a period of two months from the date of notice and also did not deposit the rent within one month from the date of receipt of summons under Section 13(1) of the Act, therefore, there was no reason for the petitioner to enter into compromise and condone the delay in depositing the rent and give further time to the respondent of another six months to deposit the rent. It appears that since there was serious dispute between the parties relating to the title of the petitioner, therefore, the concession was given by the petitioner. Vide order dated 23.11.2005 learned Executing Court has further extended the time by another 15 days for depositing the arrears of rent keeping in view the good conduct of the respondent.
9. From perusal of the order dated 23.11.2005 it appears that the amount of Rs.10,000/- was deposited by the respondent on that day only. Thus, vide judgment and decree dated 25.07.2004 respondent was required to deposit the arrears within six months which expired on 24.01.2005. In execution petition, time was further extended by 15 days vide order dated 23.11.2005. The order dated 23.11.2005 was not challenged by the petitioner, meaning thereby the petitioner agreed with the order whereby time was further extended.
10. Apart from this if the rent is deposited by the tenant as per Section 13(1) of the Act, then respondent is entitled for protection against eviction under Section 12(3) and 13(5) of the Act and in case of default for three consecutive months another suit for eviction can be filed against respondent. In the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the view that no illegality has been committed by the learned Executing Court in dismissing the execution petition in full satisfaction. Hence, petition filed by the petitioner has no merits and the same is dismissed.”
10. It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the executing court erred in coming to the conclusion that the compromise decree is inconsistent with the section 13 of the Act and the High Court simply failed to record its finding on the correctness of the order of the executing court but went astray.

11. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the executing court’s conclusion that the compromise decree insofar as it provided for the eviction of the respondent is void and calls for no interference in view of section 13 of the Act even though the High Court failed to examine the said question.

12. The High Court did not examine the correctness of the conclusion of the executing court that the compromise decree insofar as it pertained to the eviction of the respondent in the event of his failure to deposit the arrears of rent within time stipulated in the compromise decree is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and therefore void.

13. From the judgment under appeal, the relevant portion of which is extracted earlier at para 9, it appears that the High Court dismissed the case of the appellant on three grounds (i) that the appellant need not have entered into a compromise which led to the decree. According to the High Court, such a compromise was entered into by the appellant as in the view of the High Court - there was a serious dispute about the title of the appellant (ii) When the execution petition was filed by the appellant, the executing court by its order dated 23.11.2005 granted 15 days time to the respondent to pay the balance of the arrears of rent. The appellant did not choose to challenge the said order. According to the High Court, such failure of the appellant implies that the appellant acquiesced in the said order, hence, the appellant/landlord was not entitled for the recovery of the possession of his property; (iii) in view of the fact that the respondent eventually deposited the arrears of rent his possession is required to be protected in view of section 12(3) and 13(5) of the Act.

14. We are of the opinion that all the reasons given by the High Court are unsustainable in law.

The reasons which compelled the appellant to enter the compromise are irrelevant for the issue at hand. The respondent/judgment debtor cannot flout the compromise decree with impunity on the ground that his opponent entered the compromise in view of some serious dispute about the maintainability of his claim. The conduct of the appellant in entering the compromise only debars the appellant to recover possession within the period of six months from the date of the compromise decree whether the respondent paid the arrears of rent or not till the last date. If the respondent paid the said amount any time within the period of six months, the appellant would be debarred from seeking the eviction of the respondent on the cause of action which led to the filing of the eviction suit.

15. Coming to the second reason i.e., the failure of the appellant to challenge the order of the executing court dated 23.11.2005 (by which the executing court granted 15 days time to the respondent to deposit the balance of the arrears of rent) debar the appellant to recover possession of the property in dispute is equally untenable, because:

(i) in our opinion, the order of the executing court dated 23.11.2005 is beyond his jurisdiction and a nullity. The only source which confers powers on the civil court to enlarge time is found under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads as follows:-

148. Enlargement of time – Where any period is fixed or granted by the Court for the doing of any act prescribed or allowed by this Code, the Court may, in its discretion, from time to time, enlarge such period not exceeding thirty days in total, even though the period originally fixed or granted may have expired.
It is obvious from the language of the Section, such a power can be exercised only in a case where a period is fixed or granted by the court for doing of any act prescribed by this Court. In a compromise decree such as the one on hand, the stipulation that the judgment debtor is required to make the payment of the money within a specified period is a stipulation by agreement between the parties and it is not a period fixed by the court. Therefore, Section 148 CPC has no application to such a situation. We are fortified by the decision of this court in Hukumchand v. Bansilal and others AIR 1968 SC 86

(ii) In our opinion, the order dated 23.11.2005 virtually amounts to the modification of the decree and is without jurisdiction on the part of the executing court, therefore, a nullity.

It is a settled principle of law that the executing court cannot go beyond the decree. It has no jurisdiction to modify a decree. It must execute the decree as it is. This Court in Deepa Bhargava and Another v. Mahesh Bhargava and Others [(2009) 2 SCC 294] held thus:-

“9. There is no doubt or dispute as regards interpretation or application of the said consent terms. It is also not in dispute that the respondent judgment-debtors did not act in terms thereof. An executing court, it is well known, cannot go behind the decree. It has no jurisdiction to modify a decree. It must execute the decree as it is….”
16. It is well settled that such a void order can create neither legal rights nor obligations. Therefore, the appellant cannot be denied his right to recover possession of the property in dispute on the ground that he did not choose to challenge such a void order.

17. The third reason of the High Court and the conclusion of the executing court that the compromise decree insofar as it provided for eviction of the tenant in the event of his failure to pay the arrears of rent within a period of six months from the decree is contrary to the provisions of the Act are interlinked. Therefore, we are required to examine the scope of sections 12 and 13 of the Act insofar as they are relevant for the present purpose.

18. Section 12(1) of the Act restricts the right of landlord to evict his tenant only on the grounds enumerated in the said section:

12. Restriction on eviction of tenants.— (1) Notwithstanding anything the contrary contained in any other law or contract, no suit be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except one of more of the following grounds only, namely–
19. The only ground urged by the appellant in his suit is that the tenant fell in arrears of rent. Such a ground is one of the grounds in section 12(1)(a) of the Act which enables the landlord to evict the tenant if he could successfully establish that the tenant did infact fall in arrears of rent and had neither tendered nor paid the amount within the period specified under Section 12(1)(a) despite a demand. Section 12(1)(a) reads as follows:-

12(1)(a) that the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole of the arrears of the rent legally recoverable from him within two months of the date on which a notice of demand for the arrears of rent has been served on him by the landlord in the prescribed manner.”
20. Section 13(1)[2] of the Act stipulates that the tenant shall either deposit in the court or pay to the landlord an amount calculated at the rate of rent at which it was prayed for by the landlord for various periods specified therein (the details of which are not necessary for the present). Such a deposit or payment is required to be made in two contingencies. They are:-

(i) upon institution of the suit for eviction of the tenant irrespective of the ground on which eviction is sought; or
(ii) in an appeal or in a proceeding by the tenant against the decree or order of eviction.
It is further stipulated that such a deposit or payment is required to be made within a period of one month of the service of the summons, if the deposit is being made during the pendency of the suit or within a period of one month from the date of institution of appeal or other proceeding as the case may be. Further, the said sub-section also recognizes the authority of the court to extend in its discretion the said period of one month on an application made to it. Sub-section (2)[3] provides for the procedure in case of any dispute regarding the rate of rent payable whereas sub-section (3) provides for the procedure to be followed in case of any dispute regarding the person to whom the rent is payable.

21. The submission that found favour with the executing court is that in view of section 13.

“… the decree of the aforesaid Lok Adalat that in default of payment of arrears of rent the judgment debtor shall be liable to be evicted, cannot be enforced because according to Section 13 of M.P. Accommodation Control Act, if the judgment debtor pays the rent to the landlord within one month from the date of issuance of summon or within the stipulated time given by the court on an application so made by the judgment debtor, then he will be entitled for protection from eviction under Section 12 M.P. Accommodation Control Act, thus clearly entire decreetal amount has been paid in the execution proceeding, therefore, the judgment debtor shall be entitled for protection from eviction.”

22. Sub-section (5)[4] declares that if a tenant makes deposit or payment as required under sub-section (1) or (2), no decree or order for recovery of possession of the accommodation can be passed. Sub-section (5) only protects the defaulting tenant in possession in the event of his complying with the requirement of Section 13(1) or (2) only in those cases where the eviction is sought on the ground of arrears of rent falling under section 12(1)(a).

23. The case of the appellant is one falling under section 12(1)(a) and, therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance on Section 13 (5) to sustain the conclusion of the executing court. Section 13(5) reads as follows:-

“(5) If a tenant makes deposit or payment as required by sub- section (1) or sub-section (2), no decree or order shall be made by the court for the recovery of possession of the accommodation on the ground of default in the payment of rent by the tenant, but the court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to the landlord.”
24. A reading of Section 13, in our view clearly indicates that the payment or the deposit of rent into the court by the judgment debtor (tenant) is contemplated only during the pendency of the suit for eviction or an appeal (by the tenant) against a decree or order of eviction. Section 13 has no application to the execution proceedings of a decree for eviction.

25. The language of Section 13(1) is very clear and explicit in this regard. We fail to understand as to how the Court could read into Section 13, a possibility of enabling the judgment debtor (tenant) to protect his possession by making the payment during the execution proceedings in spite of the fact that he had already been adjudged to be in default of payment of the rent to the landlord. Such an interpretation of Section 13 would be wholly destructive of Section 12(1)(a). Therefore, not only the language of Section 13(1), but also an irreconcilable inconsistency that would arise between Section 12(1)(a) and Section 13(1) if the interpretation placed by the executing court is accepted - in our view is sufficient to hold that the executing court’s interpretation of Section 13(1) is unsustainable.

26. Coming to the decision of this Court in Smt. Nai Bahu v. Lala Ramnarayan and others (1978) 1 SCC 58, all that this Court held is that a landlord whose right to seek the eviction of his tenant is restricted by a statute (to the grounds specified in the statute) cannot successfully evict the tenant only on the basis of a compromise decree passed in a suit for eviction of the tenant. Apart from the consent of the tenant, one of the statutorily stipulated grounds rendering the tenant liable for eviction must necessarily exist for the validity of such a decree. In other words, this court held that a tenant who suffered a consent decree can still raise a question that none of the statutory conditions existed which render him liable for eviction when the consent decree came to be passed.

27. In the case on hand the tenant was clearly in arrears of the rent which fact is acknowledged by the compromise memo signed by the tenant which was incorporated in the decree. Looked at any angle, we are not able to agree with the judgment under appeal, nor able to sustain the executing court’s order dismissing the landlord’s execution petition. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The execution petition filed by the appellant is also allowed. The executing court will now take necessary steps for evicting the respondent from the disputed premises and handing over the possession of the same to the appellant.",1
State of Maharashtra,"Since counsel for the State of Maharashtra (Appellant) as well as Respondent No. 1, who appears in person, were ready to argue the matter finally, we heard both the parties at length.

4. The issue involved in the present case is in a very narrow compass, though actual matrix, stated in this matter, is irritatingly long. In any case, it is not necessary for us to narrate all the background facts in their entirety. Eschewing those details which are altogether unnecessary for the disposal of the present appeal, we state here under those only facts that are relevant for our purpose.

5. Having successfully cleared the Civil Services Examination and being allocated Maharashtra Cadre, as a member of the Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Respondent No. 1 joined the service in the State of Maharashtra on 1.09.1982. While, discharging duties in that capacity, he was suspended from service vide order dated 26.05.1988 which was followed by charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 for major penalty proceedings. Respondent No. 1 had challenged the legality of suspension order as well as the validity of said charge-sheet. However, we are not concerned with all those proceedings. We may only mention that in all three charge-sheets were served upon Respondent No. 1 namely, charge- sheet dated 6.07.1988, 4.5.1998 as well as charge-sheet dated 5.10.1998. Though, departmental inquiries started in these cases and gave rise to multiple litigation, some of which would be taken a note of hereinafter, it is pertinent to mention at this stage that on the basis of departmental inquiry conducted into the charges levelled vide charge-sheet dated 5.10.1998, Respondent No. 1 was dismissed from service vide order dated 2.04.2007.

6. In the charge-sheet dated 4.05.1998, the mis-demeanour alleged against Respondent No. 1 was that he unauthorizedly absented from duty i.e. did not join duty even after his suspension was withdrawn. In the third charge-sheet dated 5.10.1998, the charge related to not filing of annual returns.

7. Respondent No. 1 had challenged the validity of these charge-sheets before the Central Administrative Tribunal in which he could not succeed. His writ petitions challenging the orders of the Tribunal were also dismissed. These writ petitions were taken up along with four other writ petitions and all these writ petitions were decided by the High Court vide common judgment dated 14.12.2010. While repelling the challenge to the validity of the charge-sheets the High Court had, inter alia, observed as under:-

“ We need not dilate on the issue for the simple reason the petitioner could earn no promotion till he was exonerated in the disciplinary proceedings and we note that the petitioner is facing three inquiries and is himself responsible for the delay and we note that in one of them i.e. the 2nd charge-sheet an order dismissing him from service has already been passed which is under challenge before the Tribunal.”
8. We may record here that initially Respondent No. 1 had filed C.M. in this court and it had granted stay of the inquiry proceedings in the writ petition filed by Respondent No. 1. However, that writ was dismissed on 7.10.2002 and thereafter, Inquiry Officer was appointed on 20.12.2002. At that stage the Respondent No. 1 had sought quashing of the charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 by filing OA No. 1386/06. In that OA, he had prayed for quashing of order dated 20.12.2002 as well, under which the inquiry officer was appointed to conduct an inquiry pertaining to the said charge-sheet. This OA was dismissed by the Tribunal which was subject matter of challenge in Writ Petition(Civil) No. 2563 of 2007. This writ petition was also dismissed along with other batch matters by the aforesaid common judgment. Discussion of the High Court, while declining to quash the charge-sheet dated 6.07. 1988 is contained in paras 54 to 59 of the said judgment dated 14.12.2010. We would like to reproduce certain portions thereof, as under:-

“The Original Application has been dismissed by the Tribunal by the Tribunal holding that no mala fide against any officer and much against the one who has issued the charge-sheet has been established. It has been held that the charges are not vague. It has been held that it is impermissible to consider the evidence relied upon by the petitioner to determine whether the charges are maintainable. It has been held that it cannot be said that the charges do not attract a disciplinary action.
We may note that during arguments before us, the petitioner was not understanding the difference between the maintainability of an action vis-a-vis its sustainability. It appears that before the Tribunal the petitioner was arguing with reference to the material on which he wanted to rely and thereupon show that the charges could not be sustained; needless to state the issue, when a charge-sheet is challenged, is not whether the charge can ultimately be sustained. The issue is whether there is prima facie material to maintain the charge and whether on the allegations made in the statement of imputation a charge is attracted.
xxxxxx The petitioner has not alleged any mala fide against any officer and none has been impleaded as a respondent. During arguments the petitioner wanted us to look into the material which has yet to take the shape of evidence and thus we refrain from commenting upon the issue for the reason it would be pre- mature for us to express any view on the material on basis whereof the charge-sheet has been issued. Thus, we find no merit in WP(C) No. 2563 of 2007 and concur with the reasoning of the Tribunal that it would be pre-mature to express any opinion and as clarified by the Tribunal in para 83 of the impugned decision, in case any final order is passed against the petitioner, he may raise all legally permissible pleas.”
9. The Respondent did not challenge the aforesaid order by approaching this court. At this stage, the position relating to departmental inquiries against the respondent, can be summed up as under:-

1. Respondent No. 1 was served with three charge-sheets dated 6.07.1988, 4.05.1998 and 5.10.1998.
2. He had challenged the validity of these charge-sheets but failed in his attempts.
3. Because of the pendency of various proceedings in one judicial forum or the other, the departmental proceedings were delayed. In fact, in so far as charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 is concerned, stay of proceedings was granted by this court which continued up to October, 2002. Thereafter, when the Inquiry Officer was appointed on 20.12.2002, Respondent No. 1 filed OA before the Tribunal seeking quashing of the charge-sheet as well as orders dated 20.12.2002. The Tribunal dismissed the said OA on 6.08.2007. Respondent No. 1 filed review petition which was also dismissed on 17.01. 2007. Thereafter, he filed Writ Petition(Civil) No. 2563 of 2007 which was dismissed on 14.12.2010.
4. In the meantime, the inquiry into second charge-sheet dated 4.05.1998 proceeded which resulted in the order of dismissal from service passed against Respondent No. 1. The Respondent No. 1 has challenged the dismissal order and his OA in this behalf is pending before the Tribunal.
10. It so happened that Respondent No. 1 filed C.M. No. 18072 of 2011 in already decided Writ Petition (Civil) No. 2563 of 2007. This C.M. was dismissed by the High Court vide its order dated 21.11.2011, observing that under the garb of that C.M., Respondent No. 1 was in fact seeking review of the judgment dated 14.12.2010 and as such it was not maintainable. Respondent No. 1 thereafter filed another C.M. No. 19106 of 2011 in Civil Writ Petition No. 2563 of 2007. In this C.M. No. 19106 of 2011, he submitted that inquiry into the charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 could not proceed as it was unduly prolonged. He had relied upon order dated 21.07.2008, as per which High Court had directed that if it is permissible in law, the inquiry in question may be continued pertaining to the said charge-sheet keeping in view the fact that in another inquiry, penalty of dismissal from service was already inflicted upon the petitioner. In the order dated 21.7.2008, further direction was given to conclude the inquiry within 8 months. On that basis, in the C.M. Filed by Respondent No. 1, he had contended that no other inquiry could continue as he had been dismissed from service in one enquiry. In the alternative, as the enquiry was not concluded within 8 months as directed vide orders dated 21.7.2008, the charge-sheet lapsed.

11. Accepting the contention of Respondent No. 1 that he has since been dismissed pursuant to inquiry in the another charge-sheet, the High Court has passed the impugned order dated 28.03.2012, restraining the appellant from proceeding ahead with the charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988. Operative portion of the order is as under:-

“The inquiry against the petitioner is governed by the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969 and suffice would it be to state that having levied penalty of dismissal from service upon the petitioner in another separate inquiry pursuant to another charge-sheet, the instant inquiry pertaining to the charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 cannot continue and the proceeding have to terminate in as much as the Rules in question do not envisage a penalty to be imposed upon somebody who is not a member of the service and is not subject to the pension rules, Needless to state as a result of being dismissed from service, the petitioner is not entitled to any pension.
We accordingly disposed of the application restraining the State of Maharashtra to proceed ahead with the Charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988.”
12. It is clear from the above that only on the ground that Respondent No. 1 has already been dismissed from service in another separate inquiry, the High Court has held that in so far as charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 is concerned, inquiry cannot continue. We are of the opinion that the High Court is only partially correct in his approach. No doubt, so long as Respondent No. 1 is facing penalty of dismissal, no question arises to continue the inquiry into the charges levelled vide charge- sheet dated 6.07.1988. It is because of the reason that with the dismissal of Respondent No. 1 from service, as of now Respondent No. 1 has ceased to be the employee of the Appellant. Moreover, the employee who has already been dismissed from service cannot be imposed any other penalty on the conclusion of inquiry pertaining to the charge- sheet dated 6.07.1988. Therefore, at this stage no purpose is going to be served to continue with the inquiry into the said charge-sheet. At the same time, it is also to be borne in mind that Respondent No. 1 has challenged dismissal order and the matter is pending before the Tribunal. In case the said dismissal is set aside by the Tribunal and/ or the High Court/ this Court and Respondent No. 1 is reinstated in service as a result thereof, the relationship of employer-employee between the parties shall also stand restored. In that eventuality, it would be permissible for the appellant to proceed with the inquiry relating to charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 as well. Therefore, normally such a direction of the High Court to the effect that “proceedings have to terminate” in so far as charge-sheet dated 6.07.1988 is concerned would not be correct. Instead of terminating these proceedings appropriate order as that should normally be passed is to keep in ‘abeyance’. That is the course of action which is permissible under the extant Rules as well as, in such circumstances.

13. Having clarified the legal position, a question that arises for consideration is as to whether this Court would interfere with the orders passed by the High Court, in the facts and circumstances of this case. We may make it clear that in view of the aforesaid legal position we could have modified the orders of the High Court with direction to keep the inquiry proceedings pertaining to the charge sheet dated 6.7.1998 instead of terminating the inquiry. However, there is another important fact, which cannot be lost sight of and that compels us not to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court. The charge sheet in question is dated 6.7.1988. It pertains to the charges of the period even prior thereto. This charge sheet is thus, more than 25 years old. Further no departmental proceedings in respect of this charge sheet can start till the conclusion of the judicial proceedings in respect of dismissal orders dated 2.4.2007 relating to the charge sheet dated 4.5.1998. That process would consume few more years. We are, therefore, of the opinion that even if the dismissal order against Respondent No. 1 is ultimately set aside and he is reinstated back in service, reopening of the inquiry qua charge sheet dated 6.7.1988 after 30 years or so would not serve any purpose. Thus, while not agreeing with the reasons given by the High Court in the impugned order, for our own reasons as mentioned above, we are not inclined to interfere with the conclusion/ direction of the High Court in terminating the inquiry pertaining to charge-sheet dated 6.7.1988, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 136 of the Constitution. As a result the present appeal is dismissed",0
Viplav Sharma,"Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for some of the Deemed Universities, raised a preliminary objection in accepting the Prof. Tandon’s report, which recommended de-notifying the Deemed University status to 44 institutions. Learned senior counsel submitted that none of the procedures enumerated in the draft 2008 Regulations or 2010 Regulations, or the statutory procedures laid down in the UGC Act, have been followed by the Committee. Learned senior counsel also submitted that under the UGC Act, no power is conferred on the Central Government to constitute such a Committee, overlooking the Universities Grant Commission.

2. Learned senior counsel also pointed out that the UGC itself had examined the question about de-notifying the University status given to various institutions and found only two institutions lacked the necessary requirements and recommended de-notification. Learned senior counsel also pointed out various other infirmities in the Prof. Tandon’s report and submitted that the report has to be discarded.

3. Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel also submitted that, between 2009 and 2014, many of the Deemed Universities have rectified the deficiencies pointed out by the Tandon Committee Report and UGC may be directed to conduct a fresh exercise and advise Central Government accordingly. Shri Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel urged that most of the institutions have complied with the statutory requirements laid down under the Medical Council of India Act, Dental Council of India Act, and so on. Shri Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel also submitted that UGC may be directed to consider the matter afresh, uninfluenced by the findings recorded by the Tandon Committee Report as well as the Report of the Committee of Officers.

4. Ms. Indira Jaising, learned Additional Solicitor General, submitted that, in view of the status-quo order passed by this Court, no final decision has been taken by the Central Government, either on the basis of the report of the UGC or Prof. Tandon’s report, affirmed by the report of the Committee of Officers. Learned ASG also submitted that the Tandon Committee has examined the status and the functioning of the various institutions on the basis of laid down parameters and found that those institutions have not satisfied any of those parameters. The Tandon Committee, it was stated, has categorized the institutions as ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ and it is only the institutions included in ‘C’ category which lacked the requirements laid down for conferring the Deemed University status, both on past performance and also promise for the future. Learned ASG also submitted that the Union of India would welcome the advice of the UGC in this regard on the materials already on record, including the Tandon Committee Report. Learned ASG also submitted that no further hearing is contemplated by the UGC Act before tendering its advice to the Union of India.

5. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing for the UGC, submitted that the Prof. Tandon’s report is yet to be placed before the UGC, so also the report of the Committee of Officers. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the UGC will examine all the reports and the objections, if any, raised by the institutions against the Tandon Committee Report. UGC has also no objection to ascertain the present status of the institutions before tendering its advice to the Central Government.

6. The UGC Act has been enacted to make provisions for the coordination and determination of standards in Universities. For that purpose, it has established the UGC. Under Section 3, power has been conferred on the Central Government, on the advice of the Commission, to declare any institution for higher education as a Deemed University, for the purpose of the Act. In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 3, the University status has been given to the various institutions.

7. At this moment, we are only concerned with the legality of the continuance of Deemed University status with respect to 44 institutions. With regard to the status of those institutions, it is seen, there is some conflict between the report prepared by the UGC as well as that of Prof. Tandon.

8. Regulation 22 of UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2010 deals with the consequences of violation of regulations. Regulations 22.1 enables the Central Government and the Commission to cause an inspection of the institutions deemed to be university, or inspection in matter of the institution deemed to be university. We have now two parallel inquiries, one conducted by the UGC directly and another conducted by the Central Government through Prof. Tandon. But we find that UGC had no occasion to examine the Prof. Tandon Committee report. Further, we also notice that there is another report of the Committee of Officers, which has also not been placed before the UGC.

9. Under such circumstances, we feel it appropriate to give a direction to the UGC to examine all the reports, with notice to all the 44 institutions concerned. Institutions are free to raise their objections against the reports and the UGC has to consider the same and take an independent decision in accordance with law, if necessary, after affording a hearing, within a period of two months from today. UGC has then to tender its advice to the Central Government with its report. Needless to say that the advice of the UGC is not binding on the Union of India but has to be given due weight since the UGC is an expert statutory authority.

10. We make it clear that we have not given our stamp of approval to any of the reports and it is for the UGC to consider all the reports, with notice to the 44 institutions, in accordance with law.",1
LACHOO RAM,"The appellants are claimants. They are aggrieved by the judgment and order under appeal whereby the High Court reversed the findings given by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (II) at Shimla in MACT No. 68-S/2 of 1995 and has set aside the Award dated 30.11.1998 whereby the appellants were allowed compensation of Rs.2,74,000/- including the interim compensation, if already awarded to them along with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. from the date of the claim petition.

3. According to the learned counsel for the appellants learned High Court was not justified in substituting its own findings in place of those of the Tribunal by disbelieving statement of PW.2 Shobha Ram and PW.6 Hemant Kumar. The main criticism of the High Court judgment is on the ground that the case should have been decided on the basis of preponderance of probabilities as was done by the Tribunal whereas High Court has required a much higher degree of proof as if it was dealing with a criminal trial. The order under appeal has also been criticized on the ground that reasonings are perverse and that the High Court failed to keep in view the apparent incorrectness of the defence plea which was of total denial of the case of the claimants that the bus of the respondent was involved in the accident with the motor cycle of the deceased and the deceased died due to such accident. The judgment of the High Court is further in criticism on the ground that the Court has not given due weightage to the fact that the bus and its driver were detained almost immediately after the occurrence and FIR was also registered against the driver.

4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent-Corporation has taken a counter stand that as a First Appellate Court the High Court was bound to enter into evidence, evaluate it carefully and give its own findings with reasons for the same. According to him the reasons are sound for the view taken by the High Court which has held that there is no direct evidence to show that the bus was involved in the accident and even if that is presumed, the evidence and the circumstances show that negligence was on the part of the deceased in trying to overtake the bus on a very narrow road in the town of Shimla immediately after the bus has started moving when the traffic signal turned green.

5. We have carefully gone through the materials on record and the appeal including counter affidavit as well as statement of case of both the parties.

6. According to the case of the appellants/claimants the deceased Dalip Singh lost his life immediately after the accident as a result of rash and negligent driving of a bus belonging to the Corporation driven by Lachoo Ram respondent no.2 on 12.07.1995. It is also their case that the accident occurred near traffic lights on the narrow Cart Road at the point near Gurudwara Singh Sabha and State Bus Terminal, Shimla, which is hardly 100- 150 yards from the Gurudwara. Both, the deceased on a motor cycle and the bus had stopped at the traffic light. When the light turned green, the vehicles started. The respondent no.2 allegedly moved the bus very fast in a rash and negligent manner and struck against the motorcycle by its side. The deceased fell down and was fatally wounded leading to immediate death.

7. The case of the respondent is that there was no accident involving the bus of the Corporation and in the facts of the case there could be no question of rash and negligent driving attributed to respondent no.2. The claim for compensation was resisted on both the grounds – One, that the bus was not involved in the accident and second, that the accident did not take place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.2. The registration of the FIR against the driver soon after the accident was not denied and only a plea was taken that the criminal case was registered falsely and in fact the deceased was never hit by the bus. Further defence was taken that the deceased was an untrained driver and he himself fell down from the motor cycle and died due to his own fault.

8. The evidence and the materials as discussed by the Tribunal and the High Court lead to the conclusion that if the principle of preponderance of probabilities is applied, the Tribunal was right in giving a finding that the motor cycle of the deceased and the bus were involved in the accident. Even the High Court has not totally overruled that possibility as is clear from the observation in the second paragraph of its judgment on page 10 of the paper book in the following words:

“However, even if it is held that there was some collision the negligence is that of the motor cyclist himself since he could not and should not have tried to overtake the bus on the red light. The road at the red light is extremely narrow and from a standing position to suddenly try to overtake the bus is asking for trouble.”
9. Although the High Court has given a tentative view, as noted above, for the reasons that there were some witnesses present near the place of occurrence and they have claimed that the accident was between the motor cycle and the bus and FIR was filed soon after the occurrence against the driver, we have no hesitation in accepting the submission that on this issue the High Court should have accepted the finding of the Tribunal, specially in view of its own observation noted above.

10. But simply the involvement of the bus in the accident cannot make the respondent liable to pay compensation unless it can be held on the basis of materials on record that the accident was caused by rash and negligent act of the driver-respondent no.2. On this issue, on comparing the reasons given by the Tribunal while discussing the issue no.1 and those given by the High Court on pages 10 and 11 of the paper book, we find the reasons given by the High Court to be much more cogent and acceptable in coming to the conclusion noted above. Since the bus was standing at the red light and on being asked, soon after starting from the traffic signal it stopped within 100 to 150 yards, it has rightly been reasoned that the bus could not have started on a high speed. The road at the place of the accident was admittedly very narrow and PW.2, who has been found reliable by the Tribunal as well as by the High Court and was present on the spot, has not claimed that the bus driver had given a signal to the deceased motor cyclist to overtake him. This witness could not see the actual accident because at that time the motorcyclist, in an effort to overtake the bus had gone on its right side and was not visible and therefore he could only hear the sound of crash. It is not the case of any witnesses that the bus driver took any sudden turn while proceeding forward from the traffic signal or that he swerved the bus to the right side.",0
"Executive Engineer, Road Development","State of Maharashtra, through its Public Works Department, awarded a contract dated 12.7.2000 to the respondent-Atlanta Limited (a public limited company) for the construction of the Mumbra byepass. On 11.5.2005, a supplementary agreement for additional work was executed between the parties. It would be relevant to mention, that the Mumbra byepass falls on National highway no. 4. The construction envisaged in the contract awarded to the respondent-Atlanta Limited was, from kilometer 133/800 to kilometer 138/200. The contract under reference envisaged, settlement of disputes between the parties, through arbitration. Atlanta Limited raised some disputes through a communication dated 1.10.2009. It also invoked the arbitration clause for resolution of the said disputes. The State of Maharashtra as also Atlanta Limited nominated their respective arbitrators, who in turn, appointed the presiding arbitrator. On the culmination of proceedings before the arbitral tribunal, an award was rendered on 12.5.2012. Almost all the claims raised by Atlanta Limited were granted. In sum and substance, Atlanta Limited was awarded a sum of Rs.58,59,31,595/- along with the contracted rate of interest (of 20 per cent per annum), with effect from 1.10.2009. Atlanta Limited was also awarded a sum of Rs.41,00,000/- towards costs. All the counter claims raised by the State of Maharashtra, before the arbitral tribunal, were simultaneously rejected.

2. On 7.8.2012, the State of Maharashtra moved Miscellaneous Application no. 229 of 2012 and Miscellaneous Application no. 230 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Arbitration Act’) before the District Judge, Thane. The State of Maharashtra through the aforesaid Miscellaneous Applications sought quashing and setting aside of the arbitral award dated 12.5.2012.

3. On the same day, i.e., 7.8.2012, Atlanta Limited filed Arbitration Petition no.1158 of 2012 before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (hereinafter referred to as the ‘High Court’), for the setting aside of some of the directions issued by the arbitral tribunal (in its award dated 12.5.2012). Atlanta Limited also claimed further compensation, which according to the respondent, had wrongfully not been considered by the arbitral tribunal.

4. A perusal of the averments made in the foregoing two paragraphs reveal, that on the same day i.e., on 7.8.2012, the State of Maharashtra as also Atlanta Limited questioned the award of the arbitral tribunal dated 12.5.2012. Whilst the State of Maharashtra questioned the same before the District Judge, Thane; Atlanta Limited raised its challenge before the High Court. Since the same award dated 12.5.2012 was subject matter of challenge before two different courts, Atlanta Limited preferred Miscellaneous Civil Application no. 162 of 2012 under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 praying for transfer of Miscellaneous Application no. 229 of 2012, as also, Miscellaneous Application No.230 of 2012 (both filed by the State of Maharashtra) before the District Court, Thane, to the original side of the High Court, for being heard along with Arbitration Petition No.1158 of 2012. The aforestated Miscellaneous Civil Application No.162 of 2012 was allowed by the High Court on 15.3.2013. The operative part of the order passed by the High Court is being extracted hereunder:

“32. In the light of the above conclusion, the argument that this Court can only direct consolidation of both Petitions without passing any order with regard to their transfer, need not be considered in this case. Apart therefrom, once I find that the Respondents have no objection to consolidation of the proceedings so as to avoid conflicting decisions or simultaneous trial/hearing, then, all the more, the powers to transfer needs to be exercised in this case. It is undisputed that the parties are common to both matters. In both matters the same Award is under scrutiny. In such circumstances, the argument that both Petitions need to be consolidated but before the District Court at Thane cannot be accepted. That would mean two Courts render decisions and more or less on the same issue and may be at the same time. The arbitration petition filed by the Petitioners in this Court is already placed before the Single Judge of this Court and is now adjourned. It would be proper if the proceedings before the District Court, Thane are brought and are heard along with the Petition filed by the Petitioners in this Court.
33. As a result of the above discussion, this application succeeds.
It is made absolute in terms of prayer clause (a) with no order as to costs.” The above determination by the High Court, vide its order dated 15.3.2013, is the subject matter of challenge through Special leave Petition (C) No.18980 of 2013.

5. Leave granted.

6. The contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra, while assailing the impugned order of the High Court dated 15.3.2013 was, that it was improper for the High Court to transfer the proceedings initiated by the appellant through Miscellaneous Application No.229 of 2012 and Miscellaneous Application No.230 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the Court of the District Judge, Thane to the High Court. In this behalf, the pointed submission of the learned counsel for the appellant was, that only the District Judge, Thane, had the jurisdiction to determine the controversy emerging out of the award of the arbitral tribunal dated 12.5.2012. It was also submitted, that the proceedings initiated by Atlanta Limited through Arbitration Petition no. 1158 of 2012, ought to have been transferred from the High Court to the District Judge, Thane. In order to make good the aforesaid submission, learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the definition of the term “Court” expressed in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. Section 2(1)(e) aforementioned is being reproduced hereunder :

“2 – Definitions— (1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,—
(e) ""Court"" means the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes.” Drawing the court’s pointed attention to the definition of the term “Court”, it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, that to determine which court would have jurisdiction to decide the subject matter of an arbitral dispute, it was essential to find out the particular court which would have had jurisdiction in the matter, had the dispute been agitated through a civil suit. According to learned counsel, the latter determination, would answer the jurisdictional avenue of the arbitral dispute, in terms of Section 2(1)(e) extracted above. In this behalf it was submitted, that in the absence of any express exclusion clause between the parties, on the subject matter under reference, in order to settle the dispute inter-parties, it would have been imperative for the parties to raise their respective challenges only before the District Judge, Thane.
7. For the above submission, learned counsel also placed reliance on Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 16, according to learned counsel, would be relevant to determine the jurisdictional court, if the dispute had been agitated through a civil suit. Section 16 aforementioned is being extracted hereunder:

“16. Suits to be instituted where subject-matter situate.—Subject to the pecuniary or other limitations prescribed by any law, suits,--
(a) for the recovery of immovable property with or without rent or profits,
(b) for the partition of immovable property,
(c) for foreclosure, sale or redemption in the case of a mortgage of or charge upon immovable property,
(d) for the determination of any other right to or interest in immovable property,
(e) for compensation for wrong to immovable property,
(f) for the recovery of movable property actually under distraint or attachment, shall be instituted in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situate:
Provided that a suit to obtain relief respecting, or compensation for wrong to, immovable properly held by or on behalf of the defendant may, where the relief sought can be entirely obtained through hi s personal obedience, be instituted either in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situate, or in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain.
Explanation .--In this section ""property"" means property situate in India.” Relying on Section 16 extracted above, it was asserted by learned counsel, that the original agreement between the parties dated 12.7.2000, and the supplementary agreement dated 11.5.2005, related to the construction of the Mumbra byepass. The said construction is from Kilometer 133/800 to Kilometer 138/200. The aforesaid location of construction, according to the undisputed position between the parties, is within Thane District, and as such, within the territorial jurisdiction of the Sessions Division, Thane. Therefore, according to learned counsel for the appellant, only the “principal civil court of original jurisdiction” in District Thane i.e., the District Judge, Thane, would have jurisdiction in the matter. It was also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant, that the toll stations for collecting toll constructed by the respondent-Atlanta Limited, are also located at the venue of the Mumbra byepass. Thus viewed, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, the collection of toll (which inter alia constitutes the subject of dispute, between the parties) is also carried on by the respondents within District Thane, i.e., within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Judge, Thane. Based on Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and more particularly of clause

(d) thereof, it was the pointed submission of the learned counsel for the appellant, that only the District Judge, Thane has the jurisdiction to entertain an arbitral dispute, arising between the rival parties to the present appeal.

8. In order to further support his contention, that the District Judge, Thane alone would have jurisdiction in the matter, learned counsel for the appellant, also placed emphatic reliance on Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure which is being reproduced hereunder:

“20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.—Subject to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction
--
(a) the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or
(b) any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry or business, or personally work for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution ; or
(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.
Explanation .--A corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in India or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office, at such place.
Illustrations
(a) A is a tradesman in Calcutta, B carries on business in Delhi. B , by his agent in Calcutta, buys goods of A and requests A to deliver them to the East Indian Railway Company. A delivers the goods accordingly in Calcutta. A may sue B for the price of the goods either in Calcutta, where the cause of action has arisen or in Delhi, where B carries on business.
(b) A resides at Simla, B at Calcutta and C at Delhi, A, B and C being together at Benaras, B and C make a joint promissory note payable on demand, and deliver it to A. A may sue B and C at Benaras, where the cause of action arose. He may also sue them at Calcutta, where B resides, or at Delhi, where C resides; but in each of these cases, if the non-resident defendant objects, the suit cannot proceed without the leave of the Court.” Relying on the above provision, it was asserted, that a reading of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows, that a preference has been postulated for certain provisions including Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was evident from the opening words of Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which clearly denoted, that the issue of jurisdiction expressed in Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure, would be subject to the overriding effect in the matter of jurisdiction, expressed in the provisions preceding Section 20 (i.e. including Section

16).

9. Learned counsel for the respondent-Atlanta Limited, however, strongly opposed the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant, on the issue of jurisdiction. In this behalf, learned counsel for the respondent invited our attention to the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Maharashtra, to Miscellaneous Civil Application No.162 of 2012 (filed by Atlanta Limited before the High Court), para 8 of the reply affidavit which was pointedly brought to our notice is being extracted hereunder :

“8. In fact it is an admitted position and common ground that both;
this Hon’ble Court and the District Court at Thane have jurisdiction in respect of the subject-matter in issue. Peculiarly this Hon’ble Court falls within the definition of the term “Court” under Section 2(e) of the Arbitration Act by virtue of being a High Court in the Mumbai District having Original Jurisdiction, and on the other hand the District Court at Thane being the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the Thane District also falls within the same definition.” (emphasis is ours) In view of the stand adopted in writing by the appellants, in response Miscellaneous Civil Application no. 162 of 2012, it was sought to be asserted, that the appellants had no right to raise the issue of jurisdiction before this Court.

10. Despite the objection noticed in the aforegoing paragraphs, it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the respondent, that the High Court and not the District Judge, Thane, had the jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy raised by the rival parties with reference to the award of the arbitral tribunal dated 12.5.2012. In order to make good the aforesaid submission, it was asserted, that the contractual agreement dated 12.7.2000, as also, the supplementary agreement dated 11.5.2005, were executed at Mumbai. Additionally, it was submitted that the parties had mutually agreed, that the seat of arbitration in case of any disputes arising between the parties, would be at Mumbai. Relying on the aforesaid undisputed factual position, learned counsel for the respondent invited our attention to the determination rendered by this Court in Bharat Aluminium Company & Ors. vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc & Ors. (2012) 9 SCC 559, and made pointed reliance to the following observations recorded therein:

“96. xxx xxx xxx xxx We are of the opinion, the term ""subject matter of the arbitration"" cannot be confused with ""subject matter of the suit"". The term ""subject matter"" in Section 2(1)(e) is confined to Part I. It has a reference and connection with the process of dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. Hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat of the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in Section 2(1)(e) has to be construed keeping in view the provisions in Section 20 which give recognition to party autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by the Learned Counsel for the Appellants would, in fact, render Section 20 nugatory. In our view, the legislature has intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. This was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts where the arbitration takes place would be required to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral process. For example, if the arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi, (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as between a party from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order Under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order under Section 37 must lie to the Courts of Delhi being the Courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract were to be performed either at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such circumstances, both the Courts would have jurisdiction, i.e., the Court within whose jurisdiction the subject matter of the suit is situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute resolution, i.e., arbitration is located.

97. The definition of Section 2(1)(e) includes ""subject matter of the arbitration"" to give jurisdiction to the courts where the arbitration takes place, which otherwise would not exist. On the other hand, Section 47 which is in Part II of the Arbitration Act, 1996 dealing with enforcement of certain foreign awards has defined the term ""court"" as a court having jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the award. This has a clear reference to a court within whose jurisdiction the asset/person is located, against which/whom the enforcement of the international arbitral award is sought. The provisions contained in Section 2(1)(e) being purely jurisdictional in nature can have no relevance to the question whether Part I applies to arbitrations which take place outside India.

98. We now come to Section 20, which is as under:

“20. Place of arbitration—(1) The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration.
(2) Failing any agreement referred to in Sub-section (1), the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties.
(3) Notwithstanding Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties, or for inspection of documents, good or other property.""
A plain reading of Section 20 leaves no room for doubt that where the place of arbitration is in India, the parties are free to agree to any ""place"" or ""seat"" within India, be it Delhi, Mumbai etc. In the absence of the parties' agreement thereto, Section 20(2) authorizes the tribunal to determine the place/seat of such arbitration. Section 20(3) enables the tribunal to meet at any place for conducting hearings at a place of convenience in matters such as consultations among its members for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties.” (emphasis is ours)

11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.

12. We have recorded hereinabove the foundation, on the basis whereof, the present controversy was adjudicated before the High Court. As noticed above, the challenge to the impugned order passed by the High Court, is based on the question of jurisdiction. While the learned counsel for the appellants has placed reliance on Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act read with the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure to contend, that the District Judge, Thane, alone would have the jurisdiction in the matter; the contention raised on behalf of the respondent is, that the High Court alone in exercise of its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”, has the jurisdiction to determine the controversy arising out of the impugned award dated 12.5.2012.

13. In our view, it is not open to the appellants to advance such submission before this Court. Firstly, because the appellants had in paragraph 8 of the reply affidavit filed before the High Court, clearly acknowledged the legal position, that both the High Court as also the District Judge, Thane, in so far as the present controversy is concerned, fall within the definition of the term “Court” under Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. And secondly, because the impugned order passed by the High Court expressly notices in paragraph 10, that it was admitted by the rival parties before the High Court, that the High Court on the original side, as also the District Judge, Thane, had the jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter. Relevant part of para 10 of the impugned judgment of the High Court is being extracted hereunder:-

“10. Mr. Vashi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner submitted that in the Affidavit-in-Reply which has been filed in this petition, it is admitted by the Respondents that the place of arbitration in terms of the arbitration clause in the contract was Mumbai. It is also admitted that both, this Court on the Original Side and the District Court at Thane have jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter in issue.” (emphasis is ours) It was therefore not open to the appellants to canvass before this Court that the High Court of Bombay in exercise of its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction” could not adjudicate upon the present controversy, on account of lack of jurisdiction. We shall therefore proceed in the first instance, on the premise that both the courts referred to above had jurisdiction in the matter. We shall independently record our reasons for the same, while dealing with the submissions advanced before us. We have chosen to do so, because we are of the view, that an important jurisdictional issue has been raised, which needs to be settled, one way or the other. We shall therefore, decide the controversy on merits, irrespective of the position expressed by the appellant, on the issue of jurisdiction.
14. During the course of hearing before us, learned counsel for the appellant had highlighted for our consideration, the factual/legal controversy which was agitated by the rival parties before the High Court. In this behalf it was further pointed out, firstly, that the respondent’s case before the High Court was, that since the arbitral tribunal had its seat at Mumbai, and the works contract was executed at Mumbai, the original side of the High Court of Bombay was competent to entertain the controversy. On the other hand, the appellants before the High Court had pointed out, that since the works contract relating to the construction and maintenance of the Mumbra byepass on the Mumbai-Pune road (located on national highway no. 4), and the toll collection site were situated within Thane District, the District Judge, Thane, was the “more suitable” court for determining the controversies raised by the rival parties. Secondly, it was pointed out, that before the High Court an application under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed in the matter pending before the High Court, for transfer of proceedings filed by the respondents. It was submitted, that through the above application, it was not open to the High Court to have transferred the proceedings pending before the District Judge, Thane. It was further pointed out, that before the High Court the appellants had orally submitted, that if the High Court was inclined to invoke its jurisdiction under Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the proceedings filed by the respondent before the High Court should have been transferred to the District Judge, Thane, and not the other way around. According to the learned counsel, the instant submission has been duly noticed in the impugned judgment. Lastly, it was contended, that Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure could not be invoked in a petition filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, and therefore, Section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure ought not to have been relied upon by the High Court for transferring the proceedings from the Court of District Judge, Thane, to the High Court of Bombay.

15. The following submissions were advanced before us. Firstly, considering clause (c) of the operative part of the award, according to learned counsel it was clear, that enforcement of such a clause in the award was site-specific, since Mumbra byepass is located on the Mumbai-Pune road (on national highway no. 4) and falls in Thane District, the District Judge, Thane, ought to be “natural choice” for consideration of the issues advanced by the appellants, as also the respondent. Secondly, according to the learned counsel for the appellants, the definition of the term “Court” expressed in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act uses the expression “subject matter” and not “cause of action”. While “cause of action” can be referable to places where the works contract is executed, or where arbitration proceedings were conducted; the term “subject matter” used in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act is only referable to the subject matter of the works contract, with respect to which the dispute is raised (with respect to which, there was a direction for extension of the concession period, under the award). Accordingly it was submitted, that although the High Court may also have jurisdiction, the District Court Thane is “more natural”, “more suitable” and “more appropriate” for the adjudication of the claims, raised by the rival parties. Thirdly it was contended, that the original side of the High Court of Bombay, vis-à-vis, the District Judge, Thane, is a “superior” Court. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, even if it is acknowledged that the “ordinary original civil side” of the High Court of Bombay as also the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction” for the District Thane i.e., the District Judge, Thane, both have jurisdiction in the matter, there were many attributes on the basis of which it could be clearly established, that the original side of the High Court of Bombay, is superior to the Court of the District Judge, Thane. In this behalf it was sought to be pointed out, that the High Court could take cognizance of contempt of its own orders, and furthermore, a judgment delivered by the original side of a High Court operated as a binding precedent. It was submitted, that the District Court, Thane, does not have any such attributes. In the above view of the matter it was submitted, that reliance could be placed on Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to determine which of the two courts should adjudicate upon the matter. Section 15 is being extracted hereunder:-

“15. Court in which suits to be instituted-
Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try it.” Based on Section 15 extracted above it was submitted, that in case jurisdiction could be exercised by two Courts, it was imperative to choose the Court of the lowest grade competent to try the suit. Accordingly, it was contended, that from amongst the original side of the High Court of Bombay and the District Court, Thane, in terms of the mandate of Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the District Court, Thane, being the Court lower in grade than the original side of the High Court of Bombay, ought to have been chosen to adjudicate upon the matters. It was also pointed out, that the choice of District Court, Thane, would even otherwise be beneficial to the rival parties on account of the fact, that the determination by the said Court, would be open for re-examination before the High Court of Bombay, which exercises supervisory jurisdiction over it.
16. Additionally, it was contended, that the choice would fall in favour of the District Judge, Thane, even on account of the likely expeditious disposal of the matter by the District Judge, Thane, in comparison with the “original side of the High Court of Bombay”. In this behalf it was submitted, that there were only 42 petitions filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the District Judge, Thane, during the entire year 2012, whereas, there were 1317 petitions filed under Section 34 before the High Court of Bombay, under its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”, during the year 2012. Referring to the preceding three years, namely, 2009, 2010 and 2011 it was submitted, whereas a very few petitions were filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the District Judge, Thane, as many as, 1033, 1443 and 1081 petitions respectively (were filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act) were filed during the three years before the High Court of Bombay. Based on the above factual position it was submitted, that it could be expected that the District Judge, Thane, would dispose of the matters under reference within a short period of about five years, whereas it was likely that the disposal of the said matters will take more than two decades if the matters are required to be adjudicated by the original side of the High Court of Bombay. On the instant aspect of the matter also, referring to available data it was submitted, that it takes more than 20 years for a suit to be heard and decided by the High Court of Bombay under its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”, whereas, it does not take more than 5 years for a suit filed before the District Judge, Thane, to be disposed of. Accordingly it was contended, that keeping in view the burden of litigation, the “natural choice” for adjudication of the matters under reference ought to be the District Judge, Thane, rather than the High Court of Bombay.

17. Besides the above submissions, no other contention was advanced before us.

18. We shall first endeavour to address the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, with reference to Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In terms of the mandate of Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the initiation of action within the jurisdiction of Greater Mumbai had to be “in the Court of lowest grade competent to try it”. We are, however, satisfied, that within the area of jurisdiction of Principal District Judge, Greater Mumbai, only the High Court of Bombay was exclusively the competent Court (under its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”) to adjudicate upon the matter. The above conclusion is imperative from the definition of the term “Court” in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. Firstly, the very inclusion of the High Court “in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, within the definition of the term “Court”, will be rendered nugatory, if the above conclusion was not to be accepted. Because, the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district” namely the District Judge concerned, being a court lower in grade than the High Court, the District Judge concerned would always exclude the High Court from adjudicating upon the matter. The submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot therefore be accepted, also to ensure the inclusion of “the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction” is given its due meaning. Accordingly, the principle enshrined in Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be invoked whilst interpreting Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. Secondly, the provisions of the Arbitration Act, leave no room for any doubt, that it is the superior most court exercising original civil jurisdiction, which had been chosen to adjudicate disputes arising out of arbitration agreements, arbitral proceedings and arbitral awards. Undoubtedly, a “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district”, is the superior most court exercising original civil jurisdiction in the district over which its jurisdiction extends. It is clear, that Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act having vested jurisdiction in the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district”, did not rest the choice of jurisdiction on courts subordinate to that of the District Judge. Likewise, “the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original jurisdiction”, is the superior most court exercising original civil jurisdiction, within the ambit of its original civil jurisdiction. On the same analogy and for the same reasons, the choice of jurisdiction, will clearly fall in the realm of the High Court, wherever a High Court exercises “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”. Under the Arbitration Act, therefore, the legislature has clearly expressed a legislative intent, different from the one expressed in Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The respondent had chosen to initiate proceedings within the area of Greater Mumbai, it could have done so only before the High Court of Bombay. There was no other court within the jurisdiction of Greater Mumbai, where the respondent could have raised their challenge. Consequently, we have no hesitation in concluding, that the respondent by initiating proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, before the original side of the High Court of Bombay, had not violated the mandate of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act. Thus viewed, we find the submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, by placing reliance on Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, wholly irrelevant.

19. Reliance placed on Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by the learned counsel for the appellants, for the ouster the jurisdiction of the High Court of Bombay is equally misplaced. All that needs to be stated while dealing with the aforesaid contention is, that the controversy between the parties does not pertain to recovery of immoveable property, partition of immoveable property, foreclosure sale or redemption of immoveable property, determination of any other right to immoveable property, for determination of compensation for wrong to immoveable property and/or for the recovery of moveable property under distraint or attachment. It is only in the aforesaid exigencies that Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure could have been invoked. The construction of the Mumbra byepass, would only entitle Atlanta Limited to payments contemplated under the contract dated 12.7.2007, and no more. A brief description of the reliefs sought by the rival parties, in the separate proceedings initiated by them, does not indicate that either of the parties were claiming any right to or interest in any immovable property. Since none of the above exigencies contemplated in Section 16 prevail in the dispute between the rival parties, reliance on Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure is clearly misplaced.

20. Insofar as the jurisdiction within the District Thane, is concerned, the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction” is the court of the District Judge, Thane. Consequently, within the territorial jurisdiction of District Thane, in terms of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, the challenge could have only been raised before the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction” of the district, namely, before the District Judge, Thane. There was no other court within the jurisdiction of District Thane, wherein the instant matters could have been agitated. Therefore, the appellants having chosen to initiate the proceedings before the District Judge, Thane, i.e., in respect of a cause of action falling in the territorial jurisdiction of the District Thane, they too must be deemed to have chosen the rightful court i.e., the District Judge, Thane.

21. Shorn of the aforesaid determination, our only understanding of the submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants would be, that as a matter of “natural choice”, as a matter of “suitable choice”, as also, as a matter of “more appropriate choice”, the controversies raised by the rival parties ought to be collectively determined by the District Court, Thane, and not by the High Court of Bombay (in exercise of its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”). In order to supplement the aforesaid contention, learned counsel for the appellant had depicted the quantum of filing of similar petitions before the High Court, as also, before the District Court Thane, and the time likely to be taken for the disposal of such matters by the Courts under reference. There is no statutory provision to our knowledge, wherein the determination of jurisdiction, is based on such considerations. No such provision was brought to our notice by learned counsel. The question of jurisdiction, is a pure question of law, and needs to be adjudicated only on the basis of statutory provisions. In view of the deliberations recorded hereinabove, it may not be wrong to observe, that the submissions advanced at the behest of the learned counsel for the appellants on the issue of jurisdiction, are submissions without reference to any principles known to law. To the credit of the learned counsel for the appellants, it may however be observed, that the above considerations may constitute a relevant basis for transfer of proceedings from one court to the other. Before the above considerations can be examined, there would be one pre- condition, namely, that the above considerations could be applied for transfer of a case, where statutory provisions (express or implied) do not provide for the exercise of a definite choice. As a matter of expressing ourselves clearly, it may be stated, that inference of legislative intent from statutory provisions, would exclude from the realm of consideration, submissions of the nature relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant.

22. The first issue which needs to be examined is, whether a challenge to an arbitration award (or arbitral agreement, or arbitral proceeding), wherein jurisdiction lies with more than one court, can be permitted to proceed simultaneously in two different courts. For the above determination, it is necessary to make a reference to Section 42 of the Arbitration Act. The aforesaid provision accordingly is being extracted hereunder:

“42. Jurisdiction - Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court.” A perusal of Section 42 of Arbitration Act reveals a clear acknowledgment by the legislature, that the jurisdiction for raising a challenge to the same arbitration agreement, arbitral proceeding or arbitral award, could most definitely arise in more than one court simultaneously. To remedy such a situation Section 42 of the Arbitration Act mandates, that the court wherein the first application arising out of such a challenge is filed, shall alone have the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute(s), which are filed later in point of time. The above legislative intent must also be understood as mandating, that disputes arising out of the same arbitration agreement, arbitral proceeding or arbitral award, would not be adjudicated upon by more than one court, even though jurisdiction to raise such disputes may legitimately lie before two or more courts.
23. Ordinarily Section 42 of the Arbitration Act would be sufficient to resolve such a controversy. For the determination of the present controversy, however, reliance cannot be placed on Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, because the State of Maharashtra had moved Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 229 and Miscellaneous Civil Application No 230 of 2012 under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act before the District Judge, Thane, on the same day as Atlanta Limited had filed Arbitration Petition No. 1158 of 2012 before the High Court. In this behalf it may be mentioned, that both the parties had approached the courts referred to hereinabove on 7.8.2012. The answer to the jurisdictional question, arising out in the facts and circumstances of this case, will therefore not emerge from Section 42 of the Arbitration Act. All the same it is imperative for us to give effect to the legislative intent recorded under Section 42 aforementioned, namely, that all disputes arising out of a common arbitration agreement, arbitral proceeding or arbitral award, would lie only before one court.

24. The very fact that the appellants before this Court, have chosen to initiate proceedings against the arbitral award before “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district” i.e., before the District Judge, Thane, and the respondent before this Court, has raised a challenge to the same arbitral award before the “ordinary original civil side” of the High Court of Bombay, clearly demonstrates, that the underlying principle contained in Section 42 of the Arbitration Act would stand breached, if two different courts would adjudicate upon disputes arising out of the same arbitral award. There can be no doubt, that adjudication of a controversy by different courts, can easily give rise to different conclusions and determinations. Therefore, logic and common sense also require, the determination of all such matters, by one jurisdictional court alone. In the present case, the complication in the matter has arisen only because, the proceedings initiated by the appellants before the District Judge, Thane, and proceedings initiated by the respondent on the “ordinary original civil side” of the High Court of Bombay, were filed on the same day (i.e. on 7.8.2012). Therefore, Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, cannot be of any assistance in the matter in hand.

25. All the same, it is imperative for us to determine, which of the above two courts which have been approached by the rival parties, should be the one, to adjudicate upon the disputes raised. For an answer to the controversy in hand, recourse ought to be made first of all to the provisions of the Arbitration Act. On the failure to reach a positive conclusion, other principles of law, may have to be relied upon. Having given out thoughtful consideration to the issue in hand, we are of the view, that the rightful answer can be determined from Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, which defines the term “Court”. We shall endeavour to determine this issue, by examining how litigation is divided between a High Court exercising “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”, and the “principal civil court of original jurisdiction” in a district. What needs to be kept in mind is, that the High Court of Bombay is vested with “ordinary original civil jurisdiction” over the same area, over which jurisdiction is also exercised by the “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction” for the District of Greater Mumbai (i.e. the Principal District Judge, Greater Mumbai). Jurisdiction of the above two courts on the “ordinary original civil side” is over the area of Greater Mumbai. Whilst examining the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant under Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, we have already concluded, that in the above situation, jurisdiction will vest with the High Court and not with the District Judge. The aforesaid choice of jurisdiction has been expressed in Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, without any fetters whatsoever. It is not the case of the appellants before us, that because of pecuniary dimensions, and/or any other consideration(s), jurisdiction in the two alternatives mentioned above, would lie with the Principal District Judge, Greater Mumbai. Under the scheme of the provisions of the Arbitration Act therefore, if the choice is between the High Court (in exercise of its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”) on the one hand, and the “principal civil court of original jurisdiction” in the District i.e. the District Judge on the other; Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act has made the choice in favour of the High Court. This in fact impliedly discloses a legislative intent. To our mind therefore, it makes no difference, if the “principal civil court of original jurisdiction”, is in the same district over which the High Court exercises original jurisdiction, or some other district. In case an option is to be exercised between a High Court (under its “ordinary original civil jurisdiction”) on the one hand, and a District Court (as “principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction”) on the other, the choice under the Arbitration Act has to be exercised in favour of the High Court.

26. In the present controversy also, we must choose the jurisdiction of one of two courts i.e. either the “ordinary original civil jurisdiction” of the High Court of Bombay; or the “principal civil court of original jurisdiction” in District Thane i.e. the District Judge, Thane. In view of the inferences drawn by us, based on the legislative intent emerging out of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act, we are of the considered view, that legislative choice is clearly in favour of the High Court. We are, therefore of the view, that the matters in hand would have to be adjudicated upon by the High Court of Bombay alone.

27. In view of the conclusions drawn by us above, we uphold the order passed by the High Court requiring the matters to be adjudicated on the “ordinary original civil side” by the High Court of Bombay. The reasons recorded by the High Court, for the above conclusion, were different. The reasons for our consideration have already been notice above. In view of the above, we dispose of the instant appeal, with a direction that Arbitration Petition No. 1158 of 2012 filed by the Atlanta Limited (the respondent herein) before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, and Miscellaneous Application No. 229 of 2012 and Miscellaneous Application No. 230 of 2012 filed by the appellants before the District Judge, Thane, shall be heard and disposed of by the High Court of Bombay. We accordingly hereby direct the District Judge, Thane, to transfer the files of Miscellaneous Application No. 229 of 2012 and Miscellaneous Application No. 230 of 2012 to the High Court, for disposal in accordance with law.",0
Parminder alias Ladka Pola,"This is an appeal by way of special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution against the judgment dated 06.03.2003 of the Delhi High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 696 of 2002 by which the conviction of the appellant under Sections 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ‘IPC’) and the sentences imposed by the trial court on the appellant have been maintained.

Facts:

2. The facts very briefly are that on 30.01.2001 at about 8.00 p.m., a young girl of about fourteen years accompanied by her parents, lodged the First Information Report (for short ‘the FIR’) in Police Station, Khajoori Khas, Delhi, in which she stated as follows: She was a student of Higher Secondary School and residing with her parents at House No.131, Gali No.12, Khajoori Khas, Delhi. Opposite to their house was the house of Sardar Jagir Singh. Babbo, daughter of Sardar Jagir Singh, was her friend and she used to visit the house of Sardar Jagir Singh to meet Babbo. On 28.01.2001 at about 8.30 p.m., the lights in the area went off and as the generator at the house of Sardar Jagir Singh was on, the prosecutrix went to meet Babbo. She enquired from the appellant, the son of Sardar Jagir Singh, as to whether Babbo was in the house and the appellant told her that Babbo was inside the room. When she entered inside the room, the appellant followed her into the room, bolted the room from inside and forcibly put her on the cot. When she raised an alarm, the appellant slapped her. He then took out her salwar and underwear and raped her. He also threatened her with death if she narrated the incident to anybody. Out of fear and shame, she did not narrate the incident to anybody, but in the evening of 30.01.2001 she narrated the incident to her mother.
3. On this statement of the girl (hereinafter referred to as ‘the prosecutrix’), a case under Sections 376 and 506, IPC, was registered on 30.01.2001. The prosecutrix was medically examined on the same night. On examination of the X-rays report of the prosecutrix, the doctor opined that her age was above fourteen years but below sixteen years. Her clothes and vaginal swab were sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (for short ‘CFSL’) for analysis and as per the report from CFSL, human semen and blood was detected on the underwear of the prosecutrix, but no semen was detected in the vaginal swab. After investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the appellant under Sections 342/354/376/506, IPC. Charges, however, were framed only under Sections 376 and 506, IPC, and as the appellant pleaded not guilty, the trial was conducted. At the trial, as many as fifteen witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution including the prosecutrix. After considering the evidence on record, the trial court convicted the appellant under Sections 376 and 506, IPC. For the offence under Section 376, IPC, the trial court imposed the minimum sentence of seven years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default, rigorous imprisonment for one year and for the offence under Section 506, IPC, the trial court imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default, a rigorous imprisonment of six months. The trial court further directed that the sentences were to run concurrently. Aggrieved, the appellant filed Criminal Appeal No.696 of 2002 in the High Court, but by the impugned judgment the High Court has dismissed the appeal.
Contentions of the parties:

4. At the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Jana Kalyan Das, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that at most this is a case of attempt to rape and not rape and hence the appellant should be held guilty under Sections 376/511, IPC, and not under Section 376, IPC. He referred to the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW-1) as well as the medical evidence to support his submission that no offence of rape as such has been committed of the prosecutrix. He cited the decision of this Court in Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2012 (7) SCC 171] for the proposition that even in a case of rape, the onus is always on the prosecution to prove affirmatively each ingredient of the offence it seeks to establish and such onus never shifts and it is no part of the duty of the defence to explain as to how and why in a rape case the victim and other witnesses have falsely implicated the accused. He submitted that in the event this Court finds that the appellant is guilty of the attempt to rape and not rape, he will be liable for half the sentence provided for rape as will be clear from Section 511, IPC.
5. Mr. Das next submitted that the appellant while in jail custody studied and passed Class 10 examination and has also appeared in Class 12 examination as a candidate from Central Jail, Tihar, Delhi, and has been released on bail after undergoing three years and nine months of sentence and has thereafter got married on 16.08.2007. He further submitted that on 28.06.2008, a daughter has been born to him who is studying in lower K.G. Class and on 13.06.2012, a second daughter has been born to him, who is on the lap of her mother. The appellant has filed on 12.02.2013 an affidavit stating all these facts. He submitted that as the appellant is the sole bread earner of the family and has been doing odd jobs in Delhi to earn a living for the family, his family will suffer immensely if he is to undergo imprisonment for the remaining period out of the seven years imprisonment imposed on him by the court. He submitted that under the proviso to Section 376(1), IPC, the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than seven years. He submitted that on the facts and circumstances stated above, this Court should reduce the sentence in this case imposed on the appellant to the period already undergone so that his family does not suffer. In support of this submission, he cited the decisions of this Court in State of Rajasthan vs. N.K. The Accused [(2000) 5 SCC 30], Sukhwinder Singh vs. State of Punjab [(2000) 9 SCC 204] and Baldev Singh and Others vs. State of Punjab [(2011) 13 SCC 705]
6. In reply, learned counsel for the State, Mr. Rakesh Khanna submitted that the prosecution has discharged its onus in establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has committed rape on the prosecutrix. He relied on the evidence of PW- 1 as well as the report of the CFSL to show that it was not a case of only attempt to commit rape by the appellant. He submitted that the High Court was, therefore, right in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had committed rape on the prosecutrix.
7. On the question of sentence, Mr. Khanna submitted that this is a case where an offence has been committed on a minor girl and it is evident from the statement of prosecutrix (PW-1) that on account of the rape, her parents stopped her from going to school and she had to study 8th Class privately. He submitted that considering the serious nature of the sexual offence committed by the appellant on a minor girl, this is not a fit case in which this Court should invoke the proviso to Section 376(1), IPC and reduce the minimum sentence of seven years for the offence of rape as provided in Section 376(1), IPC, to the period already undergone by the appellant. He cited the decisions of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Bablu Natt [(2009) 2 SCC 272] and State of Rajasthan vs. Vinod Kumar [(2012) 6 SCC 770] in which this Court, after considering the language used in the proviso to Section 376(1), IPC, has set aside the orders of the High Court imposing sentences less than the minimum sentence of seven years in cases of rape under Section 376, IPC.
Findings of the Court:

8. The first question that we have to decide is whether the High Court is right in coming to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty under Section 376, IPC, for the offence of rape or whether the evidence on record in this case only made out an offence of attempt to rape under Section 376, IPC, read with Section 511, IPC. We find that the High Court while coming to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence of rape under Section 376, IPC, has considered the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW-1), the medical evidence and the report of CFSL. The prosecutrix has stated that the appellant pushed her on the cot, put off her underwear and salwar and forcibly raped her. The salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, which she was wearing at the time of incident, were sent to CFSL for analysis and after examination the CFSL had found in its report dated 30.04.2001 that there was human semen and blood on the underwear of the prosecutrix referred to in the report as Exhibit 4(B). Hence, there is corroboration of the testimony of the prosecutrix that rape was committed on her.
9. PW-15, the doctor who conducted the medical examination of the prosecutrix on 31.01.2001, however, has stated that there was no sign of injury on the prosecutrix and the hymen was found intact. The High Court has considered this evidence and has held that the non-rupture of hymen is not sufficient to dislodge the theory of rape and has relied on the following passage from Modi in Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (Twenty First Edition):
“Thus, to constitute the offence of rape it is not necessary that there should be complete penetration of penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen. Partial penetration of the penis within the Labia majora or the vulva or pudenda with or without emission of semen or even an attempt at penetration is quite sufficient for the purpose of the law. It is, therefore, quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape without producing any injury to the genital or leaving any seminal stains.” Section 375, IPC, defines the offence of ‘rape’ and the Explanation to Section 375, IPC, states that penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape. This Court has accordingly held in Wahid Khan v. State of Madhya Pradesh [(2010) 2 SCC 9] that even the slightest penetration is sufficient to make out an offence of rape and depth of penetration is immaterial. In the aforesaid case, this Court has relied on the very same passage from Modi in Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (Twenty Second Edition) quoted above. In the present case, even though the hymen of the prosecutrix was not ruptured the High Court has held that there was penetration which has caused bleeding in the private parts of the prosecutrix as would be evident from the fact that the underwear of the prosecutrix was stained by blood. In our considered opinion, the High Court was right in holding the appellant guilty of the offence of rape and there is no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that there was only an attempt to rape and not rape by the appellant.

10. The next question that we have to consider is whether the Court should invoke the proviso to Section 376(1), IPC, and impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than seven years in this case. The proviso to Section 376(1), IPC, as it stood prior to its amendment in the year 2013 expressly states that the Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than seven years in an offence under Section 376(1), IPC, “for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment”. We may now consider the cases cited by the learned counsel for the parties in which this Court has considered whether or not the proviso should be invoked to reduce the sentence to less than the minimum sentence in cases of rape.

11. In State of Rajasthan vs. N.K. The Accused (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the appellant, this Court found that the accused had committed rape on the prosecutrix who was a married woman. This Court found that that the incident was of the year 1993 and the accused was taken into custody by the police on 03.11.1993 and he was not allowed bail and during trial and during hearing of the appeal, he remained in jail and it was only on 11.10.1995 when the High Court acquitted him of the charge that he was released from jail. This Court held that though the accused had remained in jail for a little less than two years and taking into consideration the period of remission for which he would have been entitled as well as the time which has elapsed from the date of commission of the offence, the accused should not be sent back to jail and reduced the sentence to the period already undergone by him.

12. In Sukhwinder Singh vs. State of Punjab (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the appellant, this Court found that the prosecutrix was a consenting party to the act of sexual intercourse and that she had willingly left her parents’ house to be with the appellant but she was found to be “not more than sixteen years of age” and on that account, the High Court had upheld the conviction of the appellant. This Court held that as the prosecutrix had since got married and she did not want the matter to be carried any further and wanted to lead a happy and healthy married life with her husband and had filed a compromise petition to that effect, there were adequate and special reasons to reduce the sentence to the period already undergone by the accused.

13. In Baldev Singh and Others vs. State of Punjab (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the appellant, the accused was found guilty of gang rape under Section 376(2)(g), IPC, for which the minimum sentence was ten years rigorous imprisonment. The proviso to Section 376(2), IPC, however, stated that the Court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment of either description for a term of less than ten years. This Court held on the facts of the case that as the incident happened in the year 1997 and as the parties have themselves entered into a compromise, the sentence be reduced to the period already undergone in view of the proviso to Section 376(2)(g), IPC.

14. In State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Bablu Natt (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the State, this Court, on the other hand, did not find good and adequate reasons to reduce the sentence to less than the minimum sentence of seven years under Section 376(1), IPC, because of the fact that the prosecutrix was a minor and had been subjected to rape and was compelled to live for several days with the accused at Chhatarpur and set aside the judgment of the High Court insofar as it imposed a sentence of less than seven years.

15. In State of Rajasthan vs. Vinod Kumar (supra), cited on behalf of the State, the accused-Vinod Kumar had been convicted by the trial court under Section 376, IPC, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The High Court, however, reduced the sentence to five years imprisonment without recording adequate and special reasons for doing so. This Court held that the High Court failed to ensure compliance with the mandatory requirement of the proviso to Section 376(1), IPC, to record adequate and special reasons. This Court, after considering the earlier decisions of this Court, held:

“23. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that punishment should always be proportionate/ commensurate to the gravity of offence. Religion, race, caste, economic or social status of the accused or victim are not the relevant factors for determining the quantum of punishment. The court has to decide the punishment after considering all aggravating and mitigating factors and the circumstances in which the crime has been committed. Conduct and state of mind of the accused and age of the sexually assaulted victim and the gravity of the criminal act are the factors of paramount importance. The court must exercise its discretion in imposing the punishment objectively considering the facts and circumstances of the case.

24. The power under the proviso is not to be used indiscriminately in a routine, casual and cavalier manner for the reason that an exception clause requires strict interpretation. The legislature introduced the imposition of minimum sentence by amendment in IPC w.e.f. 25-12-1983, therefore, the courts are bound to bear in mind the effect thereof. The court while exercising the discretion in the exception clause has to record “exceptional reasons” for resorting to the proviso. Recording of such reasons is sine qua non for granting the extraordinary relief. What is adequate and special would depend upon several factors and no straitjacket formula can be laid down.”

16. It is, therefore, clear that what is adequate and special would depend upon several factors and on the facts of each case and no straitjacket formula has been laid down by this Court. The legislature, however, requires the Court to record the adequate and special reasons in any given case where the punishment less than the minimum sentence of seven years is to be imposed. The conduct of the accused at the time of commission of the offence of rape, age of the prosecutrix and the consequences of rape on the prosecutrix are some of the relevant factors which the Court should consider while considering the question of reducing the sentence to less than the minimum sentence. In the facts of the present case, we find that the prosecutrix was a student of eighth class and was about 14 years on 28.01.2001 and she was of a tender age. She had gone to the house of the appellant looking for her friend Babbo, the sister of the appellant. When she asked the appellant as to where the sister of the accused was, he told her that she was in the room and when she went inside the room, he followed her into the room, bolted the room from inside and forcibly put her on the cot. The appellant then took out the salwar and the underwear of the prosecutrix and raped her. As a result of this incident, her parents stopped her from going to the school and asked her to study eighth class privately. Considering the age of the prosecutrix, the conduct of the appellant and the consequences of the rape on the prosecutrix, we do not think that there are adequate and special reasons in this case to reduce the sentence to less than the minimum sentence under Section 376(1), IPC.

17. In the result, we do not find any merit in this appeal and we accordingly dismiss the same.",0
Joshinder Yadav,"The appellant who was arraigned as Accused 2 was tried along with five other accused for offences punishable under Sections 498A and 302 read with Sections 149 and 201 of the IPC by the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Madhepura. The allegations against the accused, inter alia, were that they subjected one Bindula Devi to cruelty and harassment with a view to coercing her and her other relatives to meet their unlawful demand of property and that on her failure to fulfill their unlawful demand, in furtherance of their common object, they committed her murder and that they caused disappearance of her dead body with an intention to screen themselves from legal punishment.

2. Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaipraksh Yadav. The appellant and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav are the brothers of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav is their father and Accused 5 Satya Bhama Devi is their mother. Accused 6 Fudai Yadav is brother-in-law of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav.

3. The prosecution story is reflected in the evidence of Complainant PW- 9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi. He stated that his daughter Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. He further stated that in the marriage one buffalo, one cow and one bullock were given as dowry to the accused as per their demand. However, the accused were not satisfied with that. They demanded a wrist watch and a cycle which were given to them. Even then they continued to harass and assault Bindula Devi. She gave birth to a male child. The accused kept Bindula Devi in their house and sent the child to his house so that he would rear the child. PW- 9 Debu Yadav further stated that when in Ashwin month he brought Bindula Devi to his house she told him about the ill-treatment meted out to her at her matrimonial home. She did not want to go back. He tried to pacify her. He transferred two kathas of land in her name. She then went to her matrimonial home. The accused insisted that she should sell the land. As she did not agree to selling of the land, they subjected her to further torture. PW-9 Debu Yadav further stated that on a Monday at about 4.00 p.m. Accused 6 Fudai Yadav came to his house and enquired whether Bindula Devi had come there and told him that she had run away from the house. He told Accused 6 Fudai Yadav that Bindula Devi would not run away from her house. He then proceeded to the house of the accused situated in village Kolhua along with his son Sachindra Yadav and his brother-in-law. Accused 6 Fudai Yadav accompanied them for some distance and then left for some other place. They reached Kolhua village and found the house of the accused to be empty. All the accused had left the house with their belongings. Bindula Devi was also not present. On enquiry the neighbours told him that because Bindula Devi had refused to transfer the land in the accused’s name they had administered poison to her and murdered her. He met Sub-Inspector of Police by the river side who recorded his statement. A search was conducted. The dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. Formal FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav was registered on 31/1/1989 and the investigation was started. The appellant, Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav surrendered before the court on 6/3/1989. Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav surrendered before the court on 26/8/1989.

4. At the trial, though, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses, it’s case rested on the evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav, father of the deceased and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of the deceased. PWs-2 to 7 turned hostile. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. They contended that when Bindula Devi went to take bath, she slipped in the water, got drowned and died.

5. The trial court convicted the accused under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the IPC and sentenced each of them to suffer life imprisonment. They were also convicted under Section 498A of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years each. They were further convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years each under Section 201 of the IPC. All the substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed their appeal. Hence, this appeal, by special leave, by Accused 2.

6. Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the instant case rests on circumstantial evidence. Counsel pointed out that the appellant is the brother of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav, the husband of Bindula Devi. PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated in his evidence that Accused 1 had separated from his other brothers. There is no evidence on record to establish that the appellant was party to any dowry demand or to any ill-treatment meted out to Bindula Devi. Counsel submitted that in cases where apart from husband other members of his family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, unless the circumstantial evidence is of required standard conviction cannot be based on it. In this connection he relied on Vithal Tukaram More & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra[1]. Counsel submitted that allegations about motive are vague. Medical evidence is inconclusive. The prosecution has, therefore, failed to establish its case. In any case, since the appellant was residing separately, in the absence of any clinching evidence establishing his complicity he cannot be convicted.

7. Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar on the other hand submitted that the evidence on record establishes that all the accused were staying in houses situated in the same courtyard. Counsel submitted that evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav establishes the prosecution case. Pertinently, the accused did not lodge any complaint to the police. The fact that they left the house with all their belongings suggests their complicity. Counsel submitted that Bindula Devi disappeared from the house of the accused. As to how she died in suspicious circumstances was within the knowledge of the accused. The burden was shifted to the accused which they have not discharged. Adverse inference must be drawn against the accused. In this connection, counsel relied on Balaram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar & Ors[2]. Counsel submitted that appeal be, therefore, dismissed.

8. We have already referred to the evidence of father of Bindula Devi PW- 9 Debu Yadav. He has given a graphic account of the harassment and ill- treatment meted out to the deceased by the accused. They were not happy with a bullock, a cow and a buffalo which were given as dowry. They asked for a watch and a cycle. That was also given. They asked for more. PW-9 Debu Yadav transferred 2 kathas of land to Bindula Devi. The accused wanted to sell it or wanted it to be transferred in their names and since Bindula Devi did not agree to that they continued to torture her. Her son was sent to her father so that he would be brought up by him, but she was kept in the matrimonial house obviously to work. PW-10 Sachindra Yadav the brother of Bindula Devi has corroborated his father. It is distressing to note that all the other witnesses, that is PW-2 to PW-7 turned hostile. In the facts of this case, it is indeed a pointer to the guilt of the accused. They won over the prosecution witnesses. We note with some anguish the following sentences uttered by PW-9 Debu Yadav in his cross-examination probably as an answer to the usual question about there being no independent witness to depose about cruelty. He stated “whenever my daughter visited my house, she used to complain that she is being tortured and assaulted there. Who else can be a witness to this fact?” Having perused the evidence of PWs-9 and 10 we have no manner of doubt that Bindula Devi was subjected to cruelty and harassment for dowry by the accused. Evidence of these witnesses is straightforward and honest. There is no exaggeration. In the cross-examination their evidence has not suffered any dent. Implicit reliance can be placed on them.

9. It is submitted that the appellant had separated from Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and, hence, he cannot be a party to the alleged acts of cruelty of the other accused. We find no substance in this submission. Though, PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated that Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav had separated from his brothers after marriage, he has clarified that all the brothers have their houses in a common courtyard. PW-9 Debu Yadav has specifically named the appellant as a person who demanded cattle. He has stated that the accused were not satisfied with the cattle given by him. They demanded more dowry. They used to harass and assault Bindula Devi. He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information that she had left their house, he found the house to be empty. All the accused had absconded. They had taken their belongings with them. This is confirmed by PW-13 Surendra Rai the Investigating Officer. He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information about disappearance of Bindula Devi he found the house completely empty. Even the household articles and food grains were missing. The accused were not present. No member of their family was present. Bindula Devi was also not present. These circumstances persuade us to reject the submission that the appellant did not join the other accused in treating Bindula Devi with cruelty. The conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 498A of the IPC is therefore perfectly justified.

10. We now come to the death of Bindula Devi. PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Schindra Yadav stated that dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. The Investigating Officer PW-13 Surendra Rai stated that after recording the FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav, he inspected the house of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. The dead body of Bindula Devi was found lying 600 yards away from the house of the accused. It was lying in one foot deep water, close to the southern bank of the river, near a ferry. The ferry was situated adjacent to the maize field of Hazari Mandal. He took it out and prepared inquest report. He further stated that one Vinod stated that on 29/1/1989, the accused had a meeting. On 30/1/1989, they left for some other place and in the evening it was revealed that they had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her and had thrown her dead body at the ferry. The Investigating Officer further stated that Vinod, Parmeshvari Yadav, Brij Bihari Yadav also confirmed this fact. All these persons turned hostile in the court.

11. PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal did the post-mortem on the dead body of Bindula Devi. Following are his observations:

“1. (1) Epistaxis from both nostrils.
2) Blood mixed with froth from mouth.
3) Both eye balls congested, cornea hazy.
4) Face congested and cyanosed.
5) Skin of both hands and feet were corrugated.
2. On opening of skull all the blood vessels were congested in the maninges and brain matter.
3. In the chest both the lungs were found congested, frothy and spongy and on cutting blood stains froth found in segments.
4. In the heart both chambers were found full.
5. In the stomach semi-digested food about 4 ounces with blood mixed.
6. In the small intestine-gas and solid facees.
7. In the large intestine-gas and solid facees.
8. In the case of kidneys both were found congested.
9. Liver an spleen were also found congested.
10. Uterus contained about full term dead male baby.” PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal opined that the cause of death was asphaxia due to drowning. He stated that in cases of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. He further stated that death may be caused even in one foot deep water if the victim is kept in water with his neck pressed in sleeping position. It may be stated here that report of the viscera examination is not on record. Dr. Mandal has admitted that he did not know the result of viscera examination. He added that there were no injuries on the person of the deceased.

12. In our opinion, the evidence of the father and the brother of Bindula Devi and other attendant circumstances such as strong motive; the fact that the accused did not lodge any complaint about missing of Bindula Devi; that Accused 6 Fudai Yadav went to the house of PW-9 Debu Yadav to enquire about Bindula Devi and then suddenly deserted PWs 9 and 10 when they were going to the house of the accused, that all the accused absconded from their house with their belongings and that the house was completely empty, lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused were responsible for the death of Bindula Devi.

13. It is submitted that since there were no injuries on the dead body of Bindula Devi, it would be wrong to conclude that Bindula Devi was kept in water in a sleeping position with her neck pressed as suggested by the doctor. The prosecution story that the accused caused her death must therefore be rejected. Medical evidence, it is argued, does not support the prosecution case.

14. In our opinion, the prosecution having established that the accused treated the deceased with cruelty and that they subjected her to harassment for dowry, the accused ought to have disclosed the facts which were in their personal and special knowledge to disprove the prosecution case that they murdered Bindula Devi. Section 106 of the Evidence Act covers such a situation. The burden which had shifted to the accused was not discharged by them. In this connection, we may usefully refer to the judgment of this Court in Shambhu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer[3] where this Court explained how Section 101 and Section 106 of the Evidence Act operate. Relevant portion of the said judgment reads thus:

“(10) Section 106 is an exception to Section 101. Section 101 lays down the general rule about the burden of proof.
‘Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist’.
Illustration (a) says – ‘A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed.
A must prove that B has committed the crime’.
(11) This lays down the general rule that in a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and Section 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are ‘especially’ within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience.”
15. In Balram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar[4], the prosecution had established the cruel conduct of the accused i.e. her husband and members of his family and the sufferings undergone by the deceased at their hands. The unbearable conduct of the accused ultimately resulted in her death by drowning in the well in the courtyard of the accused’s house. This Court observed that what happened on the fateful night and what led to the deceased’s falling in the well was wholly within the personal and special knowledge of the accused. But they kept mum on this aspect. This Court observed that it is true that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. But once the prosecution is found to have shown that the accused were guilty of persistent conduct of cruelty qua the deceased spread over years as was well established from the unshaken testimony of father of the deceased, the facts which were in the personal knowledge of the accused who were present in the house on that fateful night could have been revealed by them to disprove the prosecution case. This Court observed that the accused had not discharged the burden which had shifted to them under Section 106 of the Evidence Act. While coming to this conclusion, this Court relied on Shambhu Nath Mehra.

16. In the present case, the deceased was admittedly in the custody of the accused. She disappeared from their house. As to how her dead body was found in the river was within their special and personal knowledge. They could have revealed the facts to disprove the prosecution case that they had killed Bindula Devi. They failed to discharge the burden which had shifted to them under Section 106 of the Evidence Act. The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one foot deep water.

17. Pertinently, the post-mortem notes do not indicate presence of huge amount of water in the dead body. According to PW-12 Dr. Mandal, in a case of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. From the evidence of PW-12 Dr. Mandal, it appears that the death of Bindula Devi occurred immediately after she was drowned in the water because there was not much water in her stomach. It is also pertinent to note that Bindula Devi was pregnant. Her uterus contained full term dead male baby. She could not have, therefore, offered any resistance. It appears that, therefore, there were no injuries on the dead body. The whole operation appears to have been done swiftly and skillfully. But in any case, as stated hereinabove, it is not for the prosecution to explain in what manner Bindula Devi was done to death by the accused because Bindula Devi was staying in the house of the accused prior to the occurrence and she disappeared from that house. All the circumstances leading to her unnatural death were within the special and personal knowledge of the accused which they chose not to disclose. Instead, they gave a totally false explanation that when Bindula Devi had gone for bath, she slipped, got drowned in the water and died. This story is palpably false. The false explanation offered by the accused further strengthens the prosecution case as it becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstances.

18. It is true that in Vithal Tukaram More this Court has held that in a case where other members of the husband’s family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence must be of required standard if conviction has to be based on it. We are of the considered opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case is of required standard. No other inference, except that of the guilt of the accused, is possible on the basis of the evidence on record. The established facts are consistent only with the hypothesis of their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence. The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed.

19. Before we part, we must refer to a very vital aspect of this case. PW-9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi stated that the neighbours told him that Bindula Devi was poisoned by the accused. PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of Bindula Devi has also stated so. PW-13 Surendra Rai, the Investigating Officer went a step further. He stated that Vinod Yadav, Shiv Pujan Ram, Vinod Kumar Mehta, Parmeshwar Yadav and Braj Bihari Yadav told him that the accused had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her; that they had concealed the dead body in the river and had run away. Unfortunately, these witnesses turned hostile. But the fact remains that the prosecution had come out with a case of poisoning. It was, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to get the viscera examined from Forensic Science Laboratory (“the FSL”).

20. The trial court has observed that the Investigating Officer had filed a petition on 19/4/1988 requesting the doctor to send the viscera for chemical analysis to the FSL, Patna. Post-mortem notes mention that viscera was protected for future needs. This is also stated by PW-12 Dr. Mandal. Dr. Mandal has, however, added that he did not know the result of viscera examination. From the evidence of the Investigating Officer, PW-13 Surendra Rai, it appears that the doctor did not send the viscera to the FSL. When he was questioned about the viscera report, the Investigating Officer stated in the cross-examination that a letter had been sent to the doctor about viscera examination. He further stated that he did not make any complaint against the doctor to the senior officers, but, informed his officer through diary. We are of the opinion that the doctor ought to have sent the viscera to the FSL when he was requested to do so. On his failure to do so, the Investigating Officer should have informed his superior officer and taken steps to ensure that viscera is sent to the FSL rather than just making a diary entry. Such a supine indifference has a disastrous effect on the criminal justice administration system.

21. We are aware that in some cases where there is other clinching evidence on record to establish the case of poisoning, this Court has proceeded to convict the accused even in the absence of viscera report. In Bhupendra v. State of Madhya Pradesh,[5] this Court was concerned with a case where the viscera report was not on record, but, there was enough evidence of poisoning. The accused was charged under Sections 304-B and 306 of the IPC. Drawing support from the presumptions under Sections 113B and 113A of the Evidence Act, 1872 and, after referring to relevant judgments on the point, this Court held that death of the deceased was caused by poisoning. The relevant observation of this Court could be quoted.

“26. These decisions clearly bring out that a chemical examination of the viscera is not mandatory in every case of a dowry death; even when a viscera report is sought for, its absence is not necessarily fatal to the case of the prosecution when an unnatural death punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or under Section 306 of the IPC takes place; in a case of an unnatural death inviting Section 304-B of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872) or Section 306 of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act, 1872) as long as there is evidence of poisoning, identification of the poison may not be absolutely necessary.”

22. In Chhotan Sao & Another v. State of Bihar,[6] this Court was dealing with a case involving Sections 304-B and 498A of the IPC. The allegations were that the deceased was murdered by poisoning her. The viscera report was not on record. There was no other evidence on record to establish that the deceased was poisoned. This Court distinguished the case before it from the facts of Bhupendra and while acquitting the accused of the charge under Section 304-B of the IPC made the following pertinent observations:

“17. Before parting with the appeal, we wish to place on record our anguish regarding the inadequacy of investigation, the failure to discharge the responsibility on the part of the public prosecutor and the Magistrate who took cognizance of the offence under Section 304-B. The Investigating Officer who submitted the charge sheet ought not to have done it without securing the viscera report from the forensic lab and placing it before the Court. Having regard to the nature of the crime, it is a very vital document more particularly in the absence of any direct evidence regarding the consumption of poison by the deceased Babita Devi. Equally the public prosecutor failed in his responsibility to guide the investigating officer in that regard. Coming to the magistrate who committed the matter to the Sessions Court, he failed to apply his mind and mechanically committed the matter for trial. Public prosecutors and judicial officers owe a greater responsibility to ensure compliance with law in a criminal case. Any lapse on their part such as the one which occurred in the instant case is bound to jeopardize the prosecution case resulting in avoidable acquittals. Inefficiency and callousness on their part is bound to shake the faith of the society in the system of administration of criminal justice in this country which, in our opinion, has reached considerably lower level than desirable.”
23. We must note that this is the third case which this Court has noticed in a short span of two months where, in a case of suspected poisoning, viscera report is not brought on record. We express our extreme displeasure about the way in which such serious cases are dealt with. We wonder whether these lapses are the result of inadvertence or they are a calculated move to frustrate the prosecution. Though the FSL report is not mandatory in all cases, in cases where poisoning is suspected, it would be advisable and in the interest of justice to ensure that the viscera is sent to the FSL and the FSL report is obtained. This is because not in all cases there is adequate strong other evidence on record to prove that the deceased was administered poison by the accused. In a criminal trial the Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Court play a very important role. The court’s prime duty is to find out the truth. The Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Courts must work in sync and ensure that the guilty are punished by bringing on record adequate credible legal evidence. If the Investigating Officer stumbles, the Prosecutor must pull him up and take necessary steps to rectify the lacunae. The Criminal Court must be alert, it must oversee their actions and, in case, it suspects foul play, it must use its vast powers and frustrate any attempt to set at naught a genuine prosecution. Perhaps, the instant case would have been further strengthened had the viscera been sent to the FSL and the FSL report was on record. These scientific tests are of vital importance to a criminal case, particularly when the witnesses are increasingly showing a tendency to turn hostile. In the instant case all those witnesses who spoke about poisoning turned hostile. Had the viscera report been on record and the case of poisoning was true, the prosecution would have been on still firmer grounds.

24. Having noticed that, in several cases where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, we feel it necessary to issue certain directions in that behalf. We direct that in cases where poisoning is suspected, immediately after the post- mortem, the viscera should be sent to the FSL. The prosecuting agencies should ensure that the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure that the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating agencies/courts post haste. If the viscera report is not received, the concerned court must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating agency/court. The criminal court must ensure that it is brought on record.

25. We have examined the merits of the case and held that the appeal deserves to be dismissed. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.",0

Shri Vikas Mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant, has submitted that as the learned Single Judge of the High Court had allowed the writ petition filed by the applicant quashing the order of compulsory retirement with all consequential benefits except back wages and this Court allowed the appeal of the applicant and has given back wages also. The conjoint reading of both the orders tantamount to grant of all possible/permissible benefits to the applicant for his service. As the applicant was senior to Smt. Poonam Bhasin, he was entitled to the re-designated post as well as the salary for the post of Joint Secretary (Legal), which has been denied by the respondents. Therefore, the applicant is entitled for the claim and the respondents should be prosecuted and punished for disobedience of the said judgments and orders.

5. On the contrary, Shri Narender Hooda, learned AAG appearing on behalf of the respondents, has vehemently opposed the application contending that there is neither any direction of any court to give benefit of the revised post to the applicant, nor his candidature has ever been considered for that post. The State authority cannot be forced to pay the salary to two persons for one post. The applicant has never challenged the re-designation of Smt. Poonam Bhasin. Thus, there is no wilful disobedience of any order passed by this Court. The application for initiating the contempt proceedings is totally misconceived and is liable to be rejected.

6. We have considered the rival contentions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.

7. The judgment and order of the learned Single Judge granting the relief to the applicant reads:

“Resultantly, this writ petition is allowed, the order dated 19.11.2003 (Annexure P-27) is set aside and the petitioner is ordered to be reinstated into service with all consequential benefits. It is, however, clarified that the petitioner will not be entitled to wages for the period he was out of job.” (Emphasis added) The judgment and order of this Court dated 5.7.2012 in Civil Appeal No. 4985/2012 reads:
“Accordingly, we allow the appeal and modify the order of the learned Single Judge, as also of the Division Bench, by directing that the appellant will also be entitled to back-wages for the period during the termination of his services and reinstatement in terms of the High Court’s order.”
8. Both the judgments referred to hereinabove speak of back wages and the judgment of the learned Single Judge in the High Court referred to all consequential benefits. Therefore, the question does arise as to whether such an order would also mean that the applicant could claim post revision and benefits of the higher post without being considered for the said post.
9. Contempt jurisdiction conferred onto the law courts power to punish an offender for his wilful disobedience/contumacious conduct or obstruction to the majesty of law, for the reason that respect and authority commanded by the courts of law are the greatest guarantee to an ordinary citizens that his rights shall be protected and the entire democratic fabric of the society will crumble down if the respect of the judiciary is undermined. Undoubtedly, the contempt jurisdiction is a powerful weapon in the hands of the courts of law but that by itself operates as a string of caution and unless, thus, otherwise satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, it would neither fair nor reasonable for the law courts to exercise jurisdiction under the Act. The proceedings are quasi- criminal in nature, and therefore, standard of proof required in these proceedings is beyond all reasonable doubt. It would rather be hazardous to impose sentence for contempt on the authorities in exercise of contempt jurisdiction on mere probabilities. (Vide: V.G. Nigam & Ors. v. Kedar Nath Gupta & Anr., AIR 1992 SC 2153; Chhotu Ram v. Urvashi Gulati & Anr., AIR 2001 SC 3468; Anil Ratan Sarkar & Ors. v. Hirak Ghosh & Ors., AIR 2002 SC 1405; Bank of Baroda v. Sadruddin Hasan Daya & Anr., AIR 2004 SC 942; Sahdeo alias Sahdeo Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors., (2010) 3 SCC 705; and National Fertilizers Ltd. v. Tuncay Alankus & Anr., AIR 2013 SC 1299).

10. Thus, in order to punish a contemnor, it has to be established that disobedience of the order is ‘wilful’. The word ‘wilful’ introduces a mental element and hence, requires looking into the mind of person/contemnor by gauging his actions, which is an indication of one’s state of mind. ‘Wilful’ means knowingly intentional, conscious, calculated and deliberate with full knowledge of consequences flowing therefrom. It excludes casual, accidental, bonafide or unintentional acts or genuine inability. Wilful acts does not encompass involuntarily or negligent actions. The act has to be done with a “bad purpose or without justifiable excuse or stubbornly, obstinately or perversely”. Wilful act is to be distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. It does not include any act done negligently or involuntarily. The deliberate conduct of a person means that he knows what he is doing and intends to do the same. Therefore, there has to be a calculated action with evil motive on his part. Even if there is a disobedience of an order, but such disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances under which it was not possible for the contemnor to comply with the order, the contemnor cannot be punished. “Committal or sequestration will not be ordered unless contempt involves a degree of default or misconduct”. (Vide: S. Sundaram Pillai, etc. v. V.R. Pattabiraman; AIR 1985 SC 582; Rakapalli Raja Rama Gopala Rao v. Naragani Govinda Sehararao & Anr., AIR 1989 SC 2185; Niaz Mohammad & Ors. etc.etc. v. State of Haryana & Ors., AIR 1995 SC 308; Chordia Automobiles v. S. Moosa, AIR 2000 SC 1880; M/s. Ashok Paper Kamgar Union & Ors. v. Dharam Godha & Ors., AIR 2004 SC 105; State of Orissa & Ors. v. Md. Illiyas, AIR 2006 SC 258; and Uniworth Textiles Ltd. v. CCE, Raipur, (2013) 9 SCC 753).

11. In Lt. Col. K.D. Gupta v. Union of India & Anr., AIR 1989 SC 2071, this Court dealt with a case wherein direction was issued to the Union of India to pay the amount of Rs. 4 lakhs to the applicant therein and release him from defence service. The said amount was paid to the applicant after deducting the income tax payable on the said amount. While dealing with the contempt application, this Court held that “withholding the amount cannot be held to be either malafide or was there any scope to impute that the respondents intended to violate the direction of this Court.”

12. In Mrityunjoy Das & Anr. v. Sayed Hasibur Rahaman & Ors., AIR 2001 SC 1293, the Court while dealing with the issue whether a doubt persisted as to the applicability of the order of this Court to complainants held that it would not give rise to a contempt petition. The court was dealing with a case wherein the statutory authorities had come to the conclusion that the order of this court was not applicable to the said complainants while dealing with the case under the provision of West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955.

13. It is well settled principle of law that if two interpretations are possible, and if the action is not contumacious, a contempt proceeding would not be maintainable. The effect and purport of the order is to be taken into consideration and the same must be read in its entirety. Therefore, the element of willingness is an indispensable requirement to bring home the charge within the meaning of the Act. (See: Sushila Raje Holkar v. Anil Kak (Retd.), AIR 2008 (Supp-2) SC 1837; and Three Cheers Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. C.E.S.C. Ltd., AIR 2009 SC 735).

14. In view of the aforesaid settled legal proposition, we have repeatedly asked the learned counsel appearing for the applicant under what circumstances this Court can ask the statutory authority to pay the salary to two persons for one post, particularly in view of the fact that Smt. Poonam Bhasin had never been a party to the lis, nor her re-designation/promotion had ever been challenged by the applicant or someone else. More so, learned counsel for the applicant could not point out the service rules applicable to the applicant to assess his eligibility etc.

15. In such a fact-situation, leaving the issue of entitlement of the applicant, we are of the considered opinion that no case is made out to initiate the contempt proceedings against the respondents. The petition is totally misconceived and devoid of merit, hence, it is dismissed. No order as to costs.",0
Sanjay Kumar,"This special leave petition has been filed against the impugned judgment and order dated 22.7.2011, passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal Misc. No.13116 of 2009 quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondent no.2 while allowing the application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr.P.C.’).

2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this petition are that: A. The petitioner claimed to have been appointed by the private respondent no.2 in a fake dental college as a Senior Lecturer for a period of one year and issued 12 post dated cheques for payment of his salary out of which 9 cheques had bounced. The complainant-petitioner sent legal notice to the respondent no.2 but without giving them sufficient time to file a reply, filed a complaint before the Magistrate at Danapur, Patna under Sections 34, 403, 404, 406, 408, 418, 420 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’) and under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as ‘NI Act’).

B. Learned Magistrate, Danapur vide an order dated 12.5.2008 summoned the private respondent for appearance on 12.6.2008, being prima facie of the view that a case under Sections 406, 420 IPC and under Section 138 of NI Act was made out by the petitioner. The private respondent challenged the said order by filing the petition before the High Court which has been allowed vide impugned judgment and order on various grounds, inter-alia that there was an agreement between the parties for service for one year and one of the conditions in the agreement was that the petitioner would not resign from the institute till the completion of 3 years. More so, the petitioner did not even give sufficient time to the accused to respond to the legal notice as he filed the complaint within the close proximity of the date of the notice. The High Court also concluded that there was nothing on record to show that the notice had ever been served upon the private respondent and ultimately allowed the said petition on the ground that it was a case of civil nature as it was a matter of recovery of salary.

C. Aggrieved, the petitioner approached this Court making the averment in the petition that accused persons had been running a fake institution and offered the appointment to the petitioner on certain terms and in spite of working therein, he was not paid the salary.

Hence, this petition.

3. In the instant case the counsel appearing in the court for the petitioner designated himself merely has a proxy counsel. The Advocate- on-record (for short ‘AOR’) had no courtesy to send, at least, a slip mentioning the name of the counsel who has to appear in the court. Thus, in such a fact-situation, we had no advantage even to know the name of the counsel who was appearing in the court.

4. Earlier, this Court had issued notice to the petitioner himself to show cause that in case it was a fake institution, what was the reason or rationale for the petitioner to join the same and to continue to serve there for one year. In reply to the said show cause notice, the petitioner submitted that such pleadings be ignored and may not be taken into account for the purpose of disposal of the instant petition. We do not see any reason to allow a party to make a pleading in the petition and then make a submission to the court to ignore it as such an issue has no bearing on the merits of the case being totally irrelevant. Pleadings have to be true to the knowledge of the parties and in case a person takes such misleading pleadings, he can be refused not only any kind of indulgence by the court but can also be tried for perjury. In case, the pleading taken by the petitioner is true, he cannot ask for ignoring the same. In case, it is false and as such statement had been made on oath, he is liable to be tried for perjury. More so, whether such a pleading is relevant or not is a matter to be decided by the court and under Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, court has a right to ask the party even relevant or irrelevant questions and the parties or their counsel cannot raise any objection to any such question.

5. In such a fact-situation, words fail us to condemn the audacity of the petitioner to tell the highest court of the land to ignore the pleadings taken by him.

Be that as it may, this Court had insisted at the time of first round of hearing of this case that AOR, Shri Manu Shanker Mishra should remain present in the Court at the time of arguments and also passed over the matter for his appearance. In the second round, it was informed to us that the AOR refused to come to the court. We take a very serious note of the conduct of this AOR, particularly, in view of the judgment of this Court In Re: Rameshwar Prasad Goyal, (2014) 1 SCC 572, wherein this Court has categorically held that in case the AOR does not appear in the court, his conduct may tantamount to criminal contempt of the court. In fact, a very few AsOR have spoiled the working system of the institution of AsOR who simply lend their signatures for petty amount. The AOR involved herein is living in a fool’s paradise if he thinks that he can play hide and seek with any court of law.

In such a chaotic situation, any “Arzi”, “Farzi”, half- baked lawyer under the label of “proxy counsel”, a phrase not traceable under the Advocates Act, 1961 or under the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 etc., cannot be allowed to abuse and misuse the process of the court under a false impression that he has a right to waste public time without any authority to appear in the court, either from the litigant or from the AOR, as in the instant case. The AOR, with impunity was disdainful towards the order of this Court directing him to appear in the court. He had also not filed any appearance for the counsel who had appeared, nor the said counsel disclosed his name. The Court takes serious note of the conduct of the AOR, Shri Manu Shanker Mishra and warns him to behave in an appropriate manner befitting the conduct of an advocate and an AOR otherwise this Court will not hesitate to take action against him. His conduct will be under close watch of this Court.

6. With the aforesaid observations, the petition stands dismissed",0
Sadashiv Prasad Singh,"On 11.9.1989, The Allahabad Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Bank’) sanctioned a loan of Rs.12.70 lac to M/s. Amar Timber Works, a partnership firm having three partners, Jagmohan Singh, Payam Shoghi and Dev Kumar Sinha. The above loan was sanctioned to M/s. Amar Timber Works, after its partners had mortgaged certain properties to secure the loan amount. Since the loan amount was not repaid in compliance with the commitment made by M/s. Amar Timber Works, nine years later, in 1998, the Bank preferred Original Application No.107 of 1998 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal for the recovery of the Bank’s dues. The above Original Application was allowed on 21.11.2000. Accordingly, a direction was issued for the recovery of Rs.75,75,564/- from M/s. Amar Timber Works. For the execution of the order passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal, the Bank initiated recovery proceedings on 28.11.2000. During the pendency of the recovery proceedings, Jagmohan Singh, one of the partners of M/s. Amar Timber Works, died (on 27.1.2004). On 16.4.2004, the Recovery Officer attached plot No.722, located at Exhibition Road, P.S. Gandhi Maidan, Patna (hereinafter referred to as ‘the property’) measuring 1298 sq.ft. It would be pertinent to mention that the aforesaid plot was in the ownership of Jagmohan Singh, one of the partners in M/s. Amar Timber Works.

2. On 10.6.2004, Harender Singh, brother of Jagmohan Singh, filed an objection petition before the Recovery Officer alleging, that the attached property did not belong to the judgment debtors, but had been purchased by him from his brother Jagmohan Singh, by executing an agreement of sale dated 10.1.1991, which was duly notarized though not registered. It would be relevant to mention, that Harender Singh pursued the objection petition filed by him before the Recovery Officer till 26.10.2005, but chose to abandon the proceedings thereafter. The order passed by the Recovery officer when the Objector was represented for the last time on 26.10.2005 is being extracted below:

“Ld. Advocate of Bank and objectors appears. Objector reiterated his points and invited attention towards Section 53 of TP Act. Counsel of the bank submits that he had to say nothing more than what was said/submitted earlier. He also submits that D.Drs. was guarantor also in this case hence his properties attached. Put up on 28.12.08 for further hearing.
Sd/- Illegible I/C R.O.”
3. The recovery proceedings referred to above remained pending for a further period of more than two years. Finally, the Recovery Officer passed an order dated 5.5.2008, for the sale of the property by way of public auction on 4.7.2008. The Recovery Officer fixed Rs.12.92 lacs as the reserve price, and also fixed 28.8.2008 as the date of its auction. At the auction held on 28.8.2008, Sadashiv Prasad Singh, was the highest bidder. Accordingly, the Recovery Officer ordered the sale of the property in his favour on 28.8.2008. On 22.9.2008, the Recovery Officer, in the absence of any objections, confirmed the sale of the property in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Singh. The Recovery Officer also ordered, the handing over of physical possession of the property to the auction purchaser. Sadashiv Prasad Singh, the auction purchaser, took physical possession of the property on 11.3.2009.

4. In furtherance of the proceedings initiated through Mutation Case No.295/2/09-10, the land in question was mutated in favour of the auction purchaser. It would be relevant to mention that the application for mutation filed by the auction purchaser, Sadashiv Prasad Singh, was supported by letter dated 14.10.2008 of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Realization Authority, Patna. It would be relevant to mention, that no objections were filed in the mutation case preferred by Sadashiv Prasad Singh, by or on behalf of Harender Singh, before the Mutation Officer.

5. On 27.11.2009, CWJC No.16485 of 2009 was filed by Harender Singh before the High Court of Judicature at Patna (hereinafter referred to as the ‘High Court’). In the aforesaid writ petition, Harender Singh assailed the order of the Recovery Officer dated 5.5.2008, whereby, the property had been ordered to be sold by public auction in discharge of the debt owed by M/s Amar Timber Works to the Allahabad Bank. Vide its order dated 23.3.2010, the High Court ordered the auction purchaser, i.e. Sadashiv Prasad Singh to be impleaded as a party-respondent. On 27.11.2010, the High Court dismissed the above writ petition by accepting the objections raised on behalf of the Bank, as well as, the auction purchaser by holding as under :

“The above facts do weigh with the Court in not interfering with the sale or the proceeding where it has been reached. The petitioner has no satisfactory explanation for not approaching the Court well within time challenging such a decision or the subsequent proceedings or orders of the Recovery Officer at an appropriate time. The conduct of the petitioner by itself has precluded and prevented this Court from passing any order in his favour at this belated stage.
The writ application has not merit. It is dismissed accordingly.”
6. Dissatisfied with the order dated 27.4.2010 whereby the writ petition filed by Harender Singh was dismissed by a Single Bench of the High Court, he preferred Letters Patent Appeal No.844 of 2010. Before the Letters Patent Bench, Harender Singh, brother of Jagmohan Singh, asserted that his brother Jagmohan Singh had availed a loan of Rs.14.70 lacks. As against the aforesaid loan amount, the Bank had initiated proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal for the realization of a sum of 75,75,564/-. The property under reference was sold by way of public auction to Sadashiv Prasad Singh for a sum of Rs.13.20 lacs. As against the aforesaid sale consideration paid by the auction purchaser, Harender Singh, offered a sum of Rs.39 lacs before the Letters Patent Bench. In the order passed by the Letters Patent Bench disposing of Letters Patent Appeal No.844 of 2010, it stands noticed that the Bank had accepted to finally settle the matter on being paid a sum of Rs.45 lacs, subject to the condition that the Harender Singh pays a sum of Rs.15 lacs immediately, and the balance amount of Rs.30 lacs within a period of two years in a phased manner. Even though the learned counsel representing the appellant, Harender Singh was agreeable to proposal of the Bank, the rival parties could not amicably settle the matter. It is, therefore, that the letters patent Bench went on to adjudicate the matter on its merits. The above factual position has been noticed for the reason that it has a nexus to the final order which was eventually passed by the Letters Patent Bench disposing of LPA No.844 of 2010. In fact, it would be in the fitness of matters to extract paragraph 8 from the impugned judgment rendered in LPA No.844 of 2010 in order to appreciate the niceties of the matter. The aforesaid paragraph is, accordingly, being extracted herein :

“8. At this juncture, we may state that the brother of the appellant had availed a loan of Rs.14.70 lacs. The said aspect is not disputed by Mr. Ajay Kumar Sinha, learned counsel for the Bank. The Bank had initiated a proceeding before the Tribunal for realization of approximately a sum of Rs.75.75 lacs. The property has been sold for Rs.13.20 lacs. It is submitted by Mr. Ojha that the prices have gone up and he is being offered more than 39 lacs for the same. It is not in dispute that the price, the auction-purchaser has tendered, is Rs.13.20 lacs. On the earlier occasion, a suggestion was given whether the Bank would accept Rs.45 lacs in toto to settle the dispute. Mr. Sinha, learned counsel for the Bank has obtained instructions that the Bank has no objection to settle the same, if the appellant pays Rs.15 lacs immediately so that the same can be paid to the auction-purchaser and Rs.30 lacks should be paid within a period of two years in a phased manner. Mr. Choubey, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant is agreeable to pay the same. Mr. Ojha submitted that he has instructions not to accept the suggestion.”
7. During the course of appellate proceedings, the High Court referred to Chapter V of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the Debt Recoveries Act) and particularly to Section 29 which is being extracted hereunder:

“29. Application of certain provisions of Income-tax Act.—The provisions of the Second and Third Schedules to the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) and the Income-tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962, as in force from time to time shall, as far as possible, apply with necessary modifications as if the said provisions and the rules referred to the amount of debt due under this Act instead of to the Income-tax :
Provided that any reference under the said provisions and the rules to the “assessee” shall be construed as a reference to the defendant under this Act.” The High Court while interpreting Section 29 extracted above, concluded that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act and Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules would be applicable mutatis mutandis in the matter of recovery of debts under the Debt Recoveries Act. The High Court then referred to Rule 11 of the Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules and arrived at the conclusion that sub-rule (2) of Rule 11, had not been complied with by the Recovery Officer, inasmuch as, the objection raised by Harender Singh had not been adjudicated upon. As such, the High Court finally concluded that the proceedings before the Recovery Officer were in flagrant violation of the provisions of Rule 11(2) of the Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules. Having so concluded, the High Court set aside the proceedings conducted by the Recovery Officer, including the sale of the property by public auction. In order to appreciate the basis of the order passed by the High Court, Rule 11 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1961, is being extracted herein:
“Investigation by Tax Recovery Officer.
11. (1) Where any claim is preferred to, or any objection is made to the attachment or sale of, any property in execution of a certificate, on the ground that such property is not liable to such attachment or sale, the Tax Recovery Officer shall proceed to investigate the claim or objection:
Provided that no such investigation shall be made where the Tax Recovery Officer considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.
(2) Where the property to which the claim or objection applies has been advertised for sale, the Tax Recovery Officer ordering the sale may postpone it pending the investigation of the claim or objection, upon such terms as to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer shall deem fit.
(3) The claimant or objector must adduce evidence to show that-
(a) (in the case of immovable property) at the date of the service of the notice issued under this Schedule to pay the arrears, or
(b) (in the case of movable property) at the date of the attachment, he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property in question.
(4) Where, upon the said investigation, the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim or objection, such property was not, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter or of some person in truest for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, or that, being in the possession of the defaulter at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his own account or as his own property, but on account of or in trust for some other person, or partly on his own account and partly on account of some other person, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the property, wholly or to such extent as he thinks fit, from attachment or sale.
(5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the property was, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter as his own property and not on account of any other person, or was in the possession of some other person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, the Tax Recovery Officer shall disallow the claim.
(6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit in a civil court to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute; but, subject to the result of such suit (if any), the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be conclusive.”
8. Having dealt with the controversy in the manner expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, the Division Bench of the High Court was of the view that the matter in hand ought to be settled by working out the equities between the parties. Accordingly, the High Court disposed of the matter in the following manner:
“12. Though we have held the same could not have been sold in auction, yet equities are to be worked out. Regard being had to the fact that the respondent-purchaser has deposited Rs.13.20 lac between 28.8.2008 to 22.9.2009 and thus the amount is with the Bank for almost more than one year and 10 months and thereafter there had been challenge to the order in the writ petition and after dismissal of the writ petition the present L.P.A. has been filed in quite promptitude and that the amount of the respondent-purchaser was blocked, it will be obligatory on the part of the appellant to compensate the respondent-purchaser at least by way of payment of interest at the Bank rate. We are disposed to think that if a sum of Rs.17 lacs is paid to the auction-purchaser, it would sub-serve the cause of justice and house of the appellant shall be saved and, accordingly, it is directed that the appellant shall deposit a sum of Rs.17 lacks within a period of four weeks from today in the Bank. After such deposit, the Bank shall hand it over to the purchaser by way of a bank draft. The same shall be sent by registered post with acknowledgment due. Thereafter the appellant shall deposit a further sum of Rs.32 lacs within a period of two years; sum of Rs.16 lacs by 25th March, 2011 and further sum of Rs.16 lacs by 25th March, 2012. Needless to say pro-rate interest shall accrue in favour of the Bank for the said period.
13. After the amount is paid to the purchaser, it would be the duty of the Recovery Officer to hand over the possession to the appellant.”
9. Sadashiv Prasad Singh, the auction purchaser, has assailed the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in LPA No.844 of 2010 praying for the setting aside of the order by which he has been deprived of the property purchased by him in the public auction held on 28.8.2008, which was subsequently confirmed by the Recovery Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal on 23.9.2008. This challenge has been made by Sadashiv Prasad Singh by filing Special Leave Petition (C) No.23000 of 2010. The impugned order passed by the High Court on 17.5.2010, has also been assailed by Harender Singh by preferring Special Leave Petition (C) No.26550 of 2010. The prayer made by Harender Singh is, that order passed by the Division Bench places him in the shoes of the auction purchaser, and as such, he could have only been asked to pay a sum of Rs.17 lacs.
Requiring him to pay a further sum of Rs.32 lacs is unsustainable in law, and accordingly, deserved to be set aside.

10. Leave granted in both the Special Leave Petitions.

11. For the narration of facts, we have relied upon the pleadings and the documents appended to Special Leave Petition (C) No.23000 of 2010.

12. Learned counsel for the auction purchaser Sadashiv Prasad Singh, in the first instance vehemently contended, that in terms of the law declared by this Court, property purchased by a third party auction purchaser, in compliance of a court order, cannot be interfered with on the basis of the success or failure of parties to a proceeding, if auction purchaser had bonafidely purchased the property. In order to substantiate his aforesaid contention, learned counsel representing Sadashiv Prasad Singh placed emphatic reliance, firstly, on a judgment rendered by this Court in Ashwin S. Mehta & Anr. vs. Custodian & Ors., (2006) 2 SCC 385). Our attention was drawn to the following observations recorded therein :

“In that view of the matter, evidently, creation of any third-party interest is no longer in dispute nor the same is subject to any order of this Court. In any event, ordinarily, a bona fide purchaser for value in an auction-sale is treated differently than a decree-holder purchasing such properties. In the former event, even if such a decree is set aside, the interest of the bona fide purchaser in an auction-sale is saved. (See Nawab Zain-ul-Abdin Khan v. Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan (1887) 15 IA 12) The said decision has been affirmed by this Court in Gurjoginder Singh v. Jaswant Kaur (1994) 2 SCC 368).” (emphasis is ours) On the same subject, and to the same end, learned counsel placed reliance on another judgment rendered by this Court in Janatha Textiles & Ors. vs. Tax Recovery Officer & Anr., (2008) 12 SCC 582, wherein the conclusions drawn in Ashwin S. Mehta’s case (supra) came to be reiterated. In the above judgment, this Court relied upon the decisions of the Privy Council and of this Court in Nawab Zain-Ul-Abdin Khan v. Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan, (1887-88) 15 IA 12; Janak Raj vs. Gurdial Singh, AIR 1967 SC 608;
Gurjoginder Singh vs. Jaswant Kaur, (1994) 2 SCC 368; Padanathil Ruqmini Amma vs. P.K. Abdulla, (1996) 7 SCC 668, as also, on Ashwin S. Mehta (supra) in order to conclude, that it is an established principle of law, that a third party auction purchaser’s interest, in the auctioned property continues to be protected, notwithstanding that the underlying decree is subsequently set aside or otherwise. It is, therefore, that this Court in its ultimate analysis observed as under:

“20. Law makes a clear distinction between a stranger who is a bona fide purchaser of the property at an auction-sale and a decree-holder purchaser at a court auction. The strangers to the decree are afforded protection by the court because they are not connected with the decree. Unless the protection is extended to them the court sales would not fetch market value or fair price of the property.” (emphasis is ours) On the issue as has been dealt with in the foregoing paragraph, this Court has carved out one exception. The aforesaid exception came to be recorded in Velji Khimji and Company vs. Official Liquidator of Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat) Limited & Ors., (2008) 9 SCC 299, wherein it was held as under :
“30. In the first case mentioned above i.e. where the auction is not subject to confirmation by any authority, the auction is complete on the fall of the hammer, and certain rights accrue in favour of the auction-purchaser. However, where the auction is subject to subsequent confirmation by some authority (under a statute or terms of the auction) the auction is not complete and no rights accrue until the sale is confirmed by the said authority. Once, however, the sale is confirmed by that authority, certain rights accrue in favour of the auction-purchaser, and these rights cannot be extinguished except in exceptional cases such as fraud.
31. In the present case, the auction having been confirmed on 30.7.2003 by the Court it cannot be set aside unless some fraud or collusion has been proved. We are satisfied that no fraud or collusion has been established by anyone in this case.” (emphasis is ours) It is, therefore, apparent that the rights of an auction-purchaser in the property purchased by him cannot be extinguished except in cases where the said purchase can be assailed on grounds of fraud or collusion.
13. It is imperative for us, to adjudicate upon the veracity of the sale of the property by way of public auction, made in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Singh on 28.8.2008. It is not a matter of dispute, that the lis in the present controversy was between the Allahabad Bank on the one hand and the partners of M/s. Amar Timber Works, namely, Jagmohan Singh, Payam Shoghi and Dev Kumar Sinha on the other. Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was not a party to the proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal or before the Recovery Officer. By an order dated 5.5.2008, the Recovery Officer ordered the sale of the property by way of public auction. On 4.7.2008, the Recovery Officer fixed Rs.12.92 lacs as the reserve price, and also fixed 28.8.2008 as the date of auction. At the public auction held on 28.8.2008, Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was the highest bidder, and accordingly, the Recovery officer ordered the sale of the property in his favour on 28.8.2008. In the absence of any objections, the Recovery Officer confirmed the sale of the property in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 22.9.2008. Thereafter possession of the property was also handed over to the auction-purchaser on 11.3.2009. Applying the law declared by this Court in the judgments referred in the foregoing paragraphs irrespective of the merits of the lis between the rival parties, namely, the Allahabad Bank and the partners of M/s. Amar Timber Works, it is not open for anyone to assail the purchase of the property made by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in the public auction held in furtherance of the order passed by the Recovery Officer on 28.8.2008. In the above view of the matter, especially in the absence of any allegation of fraud or collusion, we are of the view that the High Court clearly erred while setting aside the auction ordered in favour of the auction-purchaser, Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in the impugned order dated 17.5.2010.

14. A perusal of the impugned order especially paragraphs 8, 12 and 13 extracted hereinabove reveal that the impugned order came to be passed in order to work out the equities between the parties. The entire deliberation at the hands of the High Court were based on offers and counter offers, inter se between the Allahabad Bank on the one hand and the objector Harender Singh on the other, whereas the rights of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha – the auction-purchaser, were not at all taken into consideration. As a matter of fact, it is Sadashiv Prasad Sinha who was to be deprived of the property which came to be vested in him as far back as on 28.8.2008. It is nobody’s case, that at the time of the auction-purchase, the value of the property purchased by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was in excess of his bid. In fact, the factual position depicted under paragraph 8 of the impugned judgment reveals, that the escalation of prices had taken place thereafter, and the value of the property purchased by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was presently much higher than the bid amount. Since it was nobody’s case that Sadashiv Prasad Sinha, the highest bidder at the auction conducted on 28.8.2008, had purchased the property in question at a price lesser than the then prevailing market price, there was no justification whatsoever to set aside the auction-purchase made by him on account of escalation of prices thereafter. The High Court in ignoring the vested right of the appellant in the property in question, after his auction bid was accepted and confirmed, subjected him to grave injustice by depriving him to property which he had genuinely and legitimately purchased at a public auction. In our considered view, not only did the Division Bench of the High Court in the matter by ignoring the sound, legal and clear principles laid down by this Court in respect of a third party auction purchaser, the High Court also clearly overlooked the equitable rights vested in the auction-purchaser during the pendency of a lis. The High Court also clearly overlooked the equitable rights vested in the auction purchaser while disposing of the matter.

15. At the time of hearing, we were thinking of remanding the matter to the Recovery Officer to investigate into the objection of Harender Singh under Rule 11 of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1961. But considering the delay such a remand may cause, we have ourselves examined the objections of Harender Singh and reject the objections for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the contention raised at the hands of the respondents before the High Court, that the facts narrated by Harender Singh (the appellant in Special Leave Petition (C) No.26550 of 2010) were a total sham, as he was actually the brother of one of the judgment-debtors, namely, Jagmohan Singh. And that Harender Singh had created an unbelievable story with the connivance and help of his brother, so as to save the property in question. The claim of Harender Singh in his objection petition, was based on an unregistered agreement to sell dated 10.1.1991. Not only that such an agreement to sell would not vest any legal right in his favour; it is apparent that it may not have been difficult for him to have had the aforesaid agreement to sell notarized in connivance with his brother, for the purpose sought to be achieved. Secondly, it is apparent from the factual position depicted in the foregoing paragraphs that Harender Singh, despite his having filed objections before the Recovery Officer, had abandoned the contest raised by him by not appearing (and by not being represented) before the Recovery Officer after 26.10.2005, whereas, the Recovery Officer had passed the order of sale of the property by way of public auction more than two years thereafter, only on 5.5.2008. Having abandoned his claim before the Recovery Officer, it was not open to him to have reagitated the same by filing a writ petition before the High Court. Thirdly, a remedy of appeal was available to Harender Singh in respect of the order of the Recovery Officer assailed by him before the High Court under Section 30, which is being extracted herein to assail the order dated 5.5.2008:

“30. Appeal against the order of Recovery Officer.— (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 29, any person aggrieved by an order of the Recovery Officer made under this Act may, within thirty days from the date on which a copy of the order is issued to him, prefer an appeal to the Tribunal.
(2) On receipt of an appeal under sub-section (1), the Tribunal may, after giving an opportunity to the appellant to be heard, and after making such inquiry as it deems fit, confirm, modify or set aside the order made by the Recovery Officer in exercise of his powers under section 25 to 28 (both inclusive).” The High Court ought not to have interfered with in the matter agitated by Harender Singh in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. In fact, the learned Single Judge rightfully dismissed the writ petition filed by Harender Singh. Fourthly, Harender Singh could not be allowed to raise a challenge to the public auction held on 28.8.2008 because he had not raised any objection to the attachment of the property in question or the proclamations and notices issued in newspapers in connection with the auction thereof. All these facts cumulatively lead to the conclusion that after 26.10.2005, Harender Singh had lost all interest in the property in question and had therefore, remained a silent spectator to various orders which came to be passed from time to time. He had, therefore, no equitable right in his favour to assail the auction-purchase made by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 28.8.2008. Finally, the public auction under reference was held on 28.8.2008. Thereafter the same was confirmed on 22.09.2008. Possession of the property was handed over to the auction-purchaser Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 11.3.2009. The auction-purchaser initiated mutation proceedings in respect of the property in question. Harender Singh did not raise any objections in the said mutation proceedings. The said mutation proceedings were also finalized in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha. Harender Singh approached the High Court through CWJC No.16485 of 209 only on 27.11.2009. We are of the view that the challenged raised by Harender Singh ought to have been rejected on the grounds of delay and latches, especially because third party rights had emerged in the meantime. More so, because the auction purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for consideration, having purchased the property in furtherance of a duly publicized public auction, interference by the High Court even on ground of equity was clearly uncalled for.

For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are of the view that the impugned order dated 17.5.2010 passed by the High Court allowing Letters Patent Appeal No.844 of 2010 deserves to be set aside. The same is accordingly set aside. The right of the appellant Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in Plot No.2722, Exhibition Road, P.S. Gandhi Maidan, Patna, measuring 1289 sq.ft. is hereby confirmed. In the above view of the matter, while the appeal preferred by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha stands allowed, the one filed by Harender Singh is hereby dismissed.",0
"THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, CHENNAI","2. This batch of six appeals, arises from separate judgments of the High Court of Madras in the appeals preferred by the revenue under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short “the Act”) rendered in Tax Case (Appeal) Nos.238 of 2000 on 8th September 2004; 1371, 1372, 1373 of 2005 on 2nd January 2006; 687 of 2007 on 18th June 2007; and 620 of 2009 on 21st July 2009. This judgment shall govern all these appeals since they entail a common substantial question of law, as is evident from the adjudication of the High Court. However, to appreciate the issue involved, Civil Appeal No.2688 of 2006 is treated as the lead case. At the outset we may note that despite service of notice, no appearance was entered for the respondent-assesses, except in C.A. No. 2688/2006 and C.A. No. 2580/2010.

Facts

3. The respondent-assessee is a firm which came into existence on 25th June, 1992. On 23rd February, 1996, a search operation under Section 132 of the Act was carried out at the premises of another concern, viz. M/s A.R. Mercantile Private Limited. During the course of search, certain books and documents pertaining to the assessee i. e. M/s A.R. Enterprises, were seized. On scrutiny, the Assessing Officer found that though the assessee had taxable income for the assessment year 1995-96, no return of income had been filed (due to be filed on or before 31st October, 1995) till the date of search. Based on the material seized by virtue of the aforesaid search, the Assessing Officer was satisfied that the assessee had not disclosed their income pertaining to the assessment year 1995-96. Accordingly (without recording any reasons for his satisfaction), he initiated action under Section 158BD of the Act requiring the assessee to file their return of income. The assessee, after filing return for the block period (ten years preceding the previous year), which covered assessment years 1993-94 to 1995-96, pointed out that they had already filed returns for the assessment years 1993-94 and 1994-95. They objected to action initiated under Chapter XIVB of the Act on the ground that in relation to the assessment year 1995-96, Advance Tax had already been paid in three installments and, therefore, income for that period could not be deemed to be undisclosed.

4. Rejecting the plea of the assessee, the Assessing Officer formed the opinion that the assessee had failed to file the return as on the date of search, and the seized documents did show income, which had not been or would not have been declared. Accordingly, he proceeded to compute total undisclosed income for the block period 1993-94 to 1995-96 (upto the date of search), treating the income returned by the assessee for the period 1995-96 as NIL, as stipulated in Section 158BB (1)(c) of the Act.

5. Against the said order, the assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. Accepting the stand of the assessee, the Tribunal allowed the appeal, and held that having paid the Advance Tax, the assessee had disclosed his income for the relevant assessment year. The Tribunal observed thus:

“Now coming to the facts of the present case, as stated supra, the assessee has not filed his return in time, but even after that date the assessee has filed his return voluntarily. Moreover not only that the assessee has also estimated his income for the year and paid advance tax thereon as detailed below:

      |15.09.1994       |Bank of Baroda,     |Rs.1,60,000     |
|                 |T.Nagard.           |                |
|12.12.1994       | -do-               |Rs.1,60,000     |
|16.03.1994       | -do-               |Rs.1,60,000     |
|                 |                    |Rs.4,80,000     |


This would indicate that the assessee has made known to the income tax department his income for the year and also paid the income tax thereon well before the due dates and of course well before the date of search also. Even this fact of income was voluntarily disclosed by the assessee to the ADI (inv.)…” Consequently, the Tribunal declared the said assessment, made under Section 158BD of the Act, as null and void.

6. Being dissatisfied, the Revenue preferred an appeal before the High Court of Madras under Section 260A of the Act, questioning the validity of the order of the Tribunal. Entertaining the appeal, the High Court formulated the following substantial question of law for adjudication:

“Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law in cancelling the assessment under Chapter XIV-B in light of the specific provision contained in Section 158BB(1) (c) of the Income Tax Act?”

7. Before the High Court, the stand of the Revenue was that since return for the assessment year 1995-96 had not been filed by the due date, by filing the return after the search, the assessee could not escape the consequences as stipulated in Chapter XIVB of the Act. It was contended that payment of Advance Tax by itself did not establish the intention to disclose the income. In support of the proposition, reliance was placed on the decision of the High Court of Madras in B. Noorsingh Vs. Union of India & Ors.[1]. In that judgment, the High Court had observed: “…Counsel submitted that in cases (sic) whereas in the case of the present petitioner, the assessee had paid advance tax, such payment would clearly indicate his intention to disclose his income and it could not be said that such person would not have disclosed his income. The payment of advance tax by itself does not establish an intent to disclose the income. The disclosure is to be made by filing the return. Even in search cases where the time for filing the return under section 139(1) has not expired, income disclosed in the books of account is not treated as undisclosed income. All that is denied to the assessee in search cases is the opportunity to file a return after the period specified in section 139(1) and to claim that the income that he would have disclosed in a belated return is not to be regarded as undisclosed income. The reason for denying such opportunity in search cases is obvious. After having suffered a search, the assessee is not to be enabled to escape the consequences of his failure to disclose all his income by filing a return after the search and after the expiry of the time prescribed under section 139(1) and by disclosing therein income which had remained undisclosed upto the date of the search.”

8. Revenue’s plea did not find favour with the High Court. Inter-alia, observing that payment of Advance Tax itself necessarily implies disclosure of the income on which the advance is paid, the High Court held as follows:

“Under clause (d) of sub-section(1) of section 158BB while assessing the aggregate of the total income, the income recorded in the books of account and other documents maintained in the normal course on or before the date of the search or requisition relating to such previous year shall be taken into consideration where the previous year has not ended or the date of filing the return of the income under sub-section (1) of section 139 has not expired. When the assessee is required to file the self-assessment for payment of the advance tax before the income-tax authorities the return of assessment would fall within the documents maintained in the normal course by the assessee and as such the income disclosed on payment of the advance tax would fall within clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 158BB. In any case although there is a difference between the regular assessment and the block assessment, as we have already noticed, unless the provisions of the block assessment specifically bar the assessing authority from taking into consideration the income disclosed by the assessee on payment of the advance tax to be taken into consideration, the income disclosed by the assessee on payment of advance tax would be an income disclosed to the Revenue and cannot be treated as an income undisclosed for the relevant assessment year.”

9. Aggrieved thereby, as aforesaid, the Revenue is before us in these appeals.

10. The short question for consideration is whether payment of Advance Tax by an assessee would by itself tantamount to disclosure of income for the relevant assessment year and whether such income can be treated as undisclosed income for the purpose of application of Chapter XIVB of the Act?

Scope of Chapter XIV-B and its Provisions

11. Sections 132 and 132A of the Act incorporate provision of search, seizure and requisition which were resorted to for the conduct of search at the premises of M/s A.R. Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. For the evaluation of the material seized during the operation or proceedings under Sections 132 or 132A of the Act, as the case may be, the provisions contained in Chapter XIV-B come into play. This chapter, consisting of sections 158B to 158BH was inserted by the Finance Act, 1995 with effect from 1.07.1995. The heading of Chapter XIV-B reads “Special Procedure for Assessment of Search Cases”. It was introduced for the assessment of undisclosed income determined as a result of search carried out under Section 132 of the Act or requisitioning of documents or assets under Section 132A of the Act. The chapter is a self-contained code and gets attracted as a result of search proceedings initiated by the income tax authorities, under Section 132 of the Act, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Act except to the extent provided for in the chapter.

12. In the facts before us, resort to this chapter was required to be made since on conduct of search at the premises of M/s A.R. Mercantile Pvt. Ltd., documents of M/s A.R. Enterprises, i.e. the assessee were recovered, that indicated non-disclosure of income by the latter. In such a scenario, Section 158BD gets attracted, which reads as follows:

“Undisclosed income of any other person.

158BD. Where the Assessing Officer is satisfied that any undisclosed income belongs to any person, other than the person with respect to whom search was made under section 132 or whose books of account or other documents or any assets were requisitioned under section 132A, then, the books of account, other documents or assets seized or requisitioned shall be handed over to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over such other person and that Assessing Officer shall proceed [under section 158BC] against such other person and the provisions of this Chapter shall apply accordingly.”

13. A bare reading of the afore-extracted provision makes it clear that the condition precedent for invoking a block assessment is a search conducted under Section 132, or documents or assets requisitioned under Section 132-A. Moreover, Section 158BD permits the application of the provisions of this chapter only on the satisfaction of the assessing officer that the seized documents show undisclosed income of a person other than the person with respect to whom search was conducted or a requisition was made. It is trite law that such satisfaction must be recorded for the benefit of the assessee. In Manish Maheshwari Vs. Asstt. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr[2]., this Court summarized the prerequisites of Section 158BD of the Act as follows:

“11. …(i) satisfaction must be recorded by the assessing officer that any undisclosed income belongs to any person, other than the person with respect to whom search was made under Section 132 of the Act;

(ii) the books of accounts or other documents or assets seized or requisitioned had been handed over to the assessing officer having jurisdiction over such other person; and (iii) the assessing officer has proceeded under Section 158-BC against such other person.”

14. In Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Hotel Blue Moon[3], one of us (H.L. Dattu, J.) while explaining the purport of Chapter XIVB of the Act, has observed that a search is the sine qua non for the block assessment; the special provisions are devised to operate in the distinct field of undisclosed income and are clearly in addition to the regular assessments covering the previous years falling in the block period, intended to provide a mode of assessment of undisclosed income, which has been detected as a result of search. Hence, from the aforementioned discussion it is clear that a valid search under Section 132 of the Act is a sine qua non for invoking block assessment proceedings under Chapter XIVB. Further according to Section 158BD of the Act the assessing officer must record his or her satisfaction that any undisclosed income belongs to any person, other than the person with respect to whom search was made under Section 132 of the Act.

15. It seems that these requisites were in fact not adhered to in the present case. During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the assessee did contend that the Revenue did not have jurisdiction to invoke Chapter XIVB of the Act, against the assessee. According to the learned counsel, before initiating proceedings under Section 158BD of the Act, the assessing officer had not recorded his satisfaction that any undisclosed income belonged to the assessee or that the assessee did not have the intention to disclose their income. Hence, the block assessment proceedings against the assessee should be quashed. However, we are unable to appreciate the submission of the learned counsel at this stage, since the same was never urged before the High Court and the Tribunal. Hence, we refrain from making any observations on a contention that had never been argued before the High Court and the Tribunal. We shall restrict our opinion strictly to the issue before us, viz. whether the payment of Advance Tax for the relevant assessment year is tantamount to disclosure of income for the purpose of application of Chapter XIVB of the Act.

16. The relevant provisions for assessment, computation and procedure of block assessment, which would come into play on the application of Section 158BD, in their erstwhile form at the relevant time, read as follows: -

“Assessment of undisclosed income as a result of search.

158BA. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provisions of this Act, where after the 30th day of June, 1995 a search is initiated under section 132 or books of account, other documents or any assets are requisitioned under section 132A in the case of any person, then, the Assessing Officer shall proceed to assess the undisclosed income in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. Procedure for block assessment.

158BC. Where any search has been conducted under section 132 or books of account, other documents or assets are requisitioned under section 132A, in the case of any person, then,—

(a) the Assessing Officer shall—

(i) in respect of search initiated or books of account or other documents or any assets requisitioned after the 30th day of June, 1995, but before the 1st day of January, 1997, serve a notice to such person requiring him to furnish within such time not being less than fifteen days;

XXX XXX XXX

(b) the Assessing Officer shall proceed to determine the undisclosed income of the block period in the manner laid down in section 158BB and the provisions of section 142, sub-sections (2) and (3) of section 143 section 144 and section 145 shall, so far as may be, apply;...” [Emphasis supplied]

17. Section 158B of the Act, which encompasses the crux of the issue, reads as follows:

“Definitions.

158B. In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, -

(a) ""block period"" means the previous years relevant to ten assessment years preceding the previous year in which the search was conducted under section 132 or any requisition was made under section 132A, and includes, in the previous year in which such search was conducted or requisition made, the period up to the date of the commencement of such search or, as the case may be, the date of such requisition;

 
(b) ""Undisclosed income"" includes any money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or thing or any income based on any entry in the books of account or other documents or transactions, where such money, bullion, jewellery, valuable article, thing, entry in the books of account or other document or transaction represents wholly or partly income or property which has not been or would not have been disclosed for the purposes of this Act.” [Emphasis supplied]

18. The genesis of the issue before us lies within the folds of this section. Sections 158BD and 158BC, along with the rest of Chapter XIV-B, find application only in the event of discovery of “undisclosed income” of an assessee. Undisclosed income is defined by Section 158B as that income “which has not been or would not have been disclosed for the purposes of this Act”. The legislature has chosen to define “undisclosed income” in terms of income not disclosed, without providing any definition of “disclosure” of income in the first place. We are of the view that the only way of disclosing income, on the part of an assessee, is through filing of a return, as stipulated in the Act, and therefore an “undisclosed income” signifies income not stated in the return filed. Keeping that in mind, it seems that the legislature has clearly carved out two scenarios for income to be deemed as undisclosed: (i) where the income has clearly not been disclosed and (ii) where the income would not have been disclosed. If a situation is covered by any one of the two, income would be undisclosed in the eyes of the Act and hence subject to the machinery provisions of Chapter XIVB. The second category, viz. where income would not have been disclosed, contemplates the likelihood of disclosure; it is a presumption of the intention of the assessee since in concluding that an assessee would or would not have disclosed income, one is ipso facto making a statement with respect to whether or not the assessee possessed the intention to do the same. To gauge this, however, reliance must be placed on the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case.

19. One such fact, as the assessee claims, is the payment of Advance Tax. However, in our opinion, the degree of its material significance depends on the time at which the search is conducted in relation to the due date for filing return. Depending on which side of the due date the search is conducted, material significance of payment of Advance Taxes vacillates in construing the intention of the assessee. If the search is conducted after the expiry of the due date for filing return, payment of Advance Tax is irrelevant in construing the intention of the assessee to disclose income. Such a situation would find place within the first category carved out by Section 158B of the Act i.e. where income has clearly not been disclosed. The possibility of the intention to disclose does not arise since, as held earlier, the opportunity of disclosure has lapsed i.e. through filing of return of income by the due date. If, on the other hand, search is conducted prior to the due date for filing return, the opportunity to disclose income or, in other words, to file return and disclose income still persists. In which case, payment of Advance Tax may be a material fact for construing whether an assessee intended to disclose. An assessee is entitled to make the legitimate claim that even though the search or the documents recovered, show an income earned by him, he has paid Advance Tax for the relevant assessment year and has an opportunity to declare the total income, in the return of income, which he would file by the due date. Hence, the fulcrum of such a decision is the due date for filing of return of income vis-à-vis date of search. Payment of Advance Tax may be a relevant factor in construing intention to disclose income or filing return as long as the assessee continues to have the opportunity to file return and disclose his income and not past the due date of filing return. Therefore, there can be no generic rule as to the significance of payment of Advance Tax in construing intention of disclosure of income. The same depends on the facts of the case, and hinges on the positioning of the search operations qua the due date for filing returns.

20. Thus, at the very outset, in our view, the question that whether payment of Advance Tax by an assessee per se is tantamount to disclosure of total income, for the relevant assessment year, must be answered in the negative. On further scrutiny, we find yet another reason to opine so. Payment of Advance Tax and filing of return are functions of completely different notions of income i.e. estimated income and total income respectively. The payment of Advance Tax is based on an estimation of the total income that is chargeable to tax and not on the total income itself.

21. Section 2(45) of Act defines “total income” as-

""total income"" means the total amount of income referred to in section 5, computed in the manner laid down in this Act ;”

22. Section 5 of the Act lays down the “scope of total income” as-

“5. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the total income of any previous year of a person who is a resident includes all income from whatever source derived which—
(a)  is received or is deemed to be received in India in such year by or on behalf of such person ; or
(b)  accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during such year ; or
(c)  accrues or arises to him outside India during such year :…”
23. Section 158BB(1) of the Act provides the method of computation of undisclosed income for a block period. It is significant to note that the computation of the undisclosed income of the block period shall be the aggregate of the total income of the previous years falling within the block period, computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This amount is reduced by the aggregate of the total income, or as increased by the losses returned or determined earlier, in respect of such previous years in accordance with the provisions of this section.

24. Section 158BB(1) reads as follows-

“158BB. (1) The undisclosed income of the block period shall be the aggregate of the total income of the previous years falling within the block period computed, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, on the basis of evidence found as a result of search or requisition of books of account or other documents and such other materials or information as are available with the Assessing Officer and relatable to such evidence, as reduced by the aggregate of the total income, or as the case may be, as increased by the aggregate of the losses of such previous years, determined,—
(a) XXX XXX XXX
(b) XXX XXX XXX
(c) where the due date for filing a return of income has expired but no return of income has been filed, as nil
25. Further, the explanation to Section 158BB(1) reads-

“Explanation: For the purposes of determination of undisclosed income,—
(a) the total income or loss of each previous year shall, for the purpose of aggregation, be taken as the total income or loss computed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV without giving effect to set off of brought forward losses under Chapter VI or unabsorbed depreciation under sub-section (2) of section 32;
(b) of a firm, or its partners, the method of computation of undisclosed income and its allocation to the partners shall be in accordance with the method adopted for determining the assessed income or returned income for each of the previous years falling within the block period;...”
26. Hence, the computation of “undisclosed income” for the purposes of Chapter XIVB has to be construed in terms of the “total income” received, accrued, arisen; or which is deemed to have been received, accrued or arisen in the previous year, and is computed according to the provisions of the Act. According to Section 139(1) of the Act, every person who is assessable under the Act, must file a return declaring his or her total income during the previous year on or before the due date, for assessment under Section 143 of the Act. Hence, the ‘disclosure of income’ is the disclosure of the total income in a valid return under Section 139, subject to assessment and chargeable to tax under the provisions of the Act. It is important to bear in mind that total income is distinct from the estimated income, upon the basis of which, Advance Tax is paid by an assessee. Advance Tax is based on estimated income, and hence, it cannot result in the disclosure of the total income assessable and chargeable to tax.

27. Before we proceed further to elaborate upon this distinction, it would be useful to refer to the provisions relating to payment of Advance Tax under the Act. Chapter XVII of the Act, which deals with “Collection and Recovery of Tax”, contains provisions for the payment of Advance Tax and tax deducted at source. Advance Tax is the tax payable on the estimated total income of the relevant financial year which is chargeable to tax in the assessment year but is payable in that very financial year.

28. Section 207 of the Act lays down the liability for payment of Advance Tax as:-

“207.  Tax shall be payable in advance during any financial year, in accordance with the provisions of sections 208 to 219 (both inclusive), in respect of the total income of the assessee which would be chargeable to tax for the assessment year immediately following that financial year, such income being hereafter in this Chapter referred to as “current income.”
29. Section 208 specifies the conditions of liability to pay Advance Tax as:-

“208. Advance tax shall be payable during a financial year in every case where the amount of such tax payable by the assessee during that year, as computed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, is one thousand five hundred rupees or more.”
30. Thus, in every case where the amount of tax payable on the total income earned during the financial year is one thousand five hundred rupees or more, then, an assessee would be liable to pay in the financial year itself, Advance Tax on such income, also known as “current income.” It is in this context the following questions arise: (i) What is the nature of the “current income” upon which the Advance Tax is paid and is it the same as the total income? and (ii) Whether the payment of Advance Tax results in the disclosure of the actual total income?

31. Section 210(1) of the Act refers to the payment of Advance Tax by the assessee of his own accord:-

“210. (1) Every person who is liable to pay advance tax under section 208 (whether or not he has been previously assessed by way of regular assessment) shall, of his own accord, pay, on or before each of the due dates specified in section 211, the appropriate percentage, specified in that section, of the advance tax on his current income, calculated in the manner laid down in section 209.”

32. Section 209(1)(a) lays down the method of computation of Advance Tax to be paid by an assessee as follows:

“209. [(1) The amount of advance tax payable by an assessee in the financial year shall, subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), be computed as follows, namely :—

(a)  where the calculation is made by the assessee for the purposes of payment of advance tax under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or sub- section (5) or sub-section (6) of section 210, he shall first estimate his current income and income-tax thereon shall be calculated at the rates in force in the financial year..”

33. According to Section 210(1) of the Act, every person who is liable to pay Advance Tax under Section 208 (whether or not he has been previously assessed by way of regular assessment) shall, of his own accord, pay Advance Tax on his “current income”, calculated in the manner laid down in section 209. Further according to Section 209(1)(a), the assessee shall first estimate his “current income” and thereafter pay income tax calculated on this estimated income on the rates in force in the relevant financial year. It is significant to note that this income is an estimation that is made by the assessee and may not be the exact income, which may ultimately be declared in the return under Section 139 and assessed under Section 143 of the Act. Needless to emphasise that payment of Advance Tax does not absolve an assessee from an obligation to file return disclosing total income for the relevant assessment year. In short, the disclosure of total income by the filing of return under Section 139 of the Act is mandatory even after the payment of Advance Tax by an assessee, since the “current income” which forms the basis of the Advance Tax is a mere estimation and not the final total income for the relevant assessment year liable to be assessed.

34. In Brij Lal & Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Jalandhar[4], while explaining the scope of the provisions on Advance Tax, this Court expressed the view that the “current income” in respect of which the assessee pays Advance Tax is not the same as understood in Section 2(45). In this regard, the Court held:

“8. Liability to pay advance tax arises under Section 207. The said section is based on the principle “pay as you earn”. It requires tax to be paid during the financial year. It has to be in respect of the total income of the assessee which would be chargeable to tax under the Act. The said total income is not as understood in Section 2(45) but it is equated to “current income” for the purposes of Chapter XVII. After the amending Act of 1987, advance tax is to be paid on the current income which would be chargeable to tax for the assessment year immediately following the financial year. Section 210 casts the responsibility of payment of advance tax on the assessee without requiring the assessee to submit his estimate of advance tax payable. Provision for payment of advance tax is a mode of quick collection of tax.

9. Thus, Section 207 defines liability to pay advance tax in respect of incomes referred to in Section 208. However, advance tax paid is adjustable towards the tax due. Advance tax is collected even before the income tax becomes due and payable. By its very nature, advance tax is pre-assessment collection of taxes either by deduction of tax at source or by payment of advance tax which has to be adjusted towards income tax levied on the total income. The above two methods of realisation even before any assessment is authorised by Section 4(2) are incorporated in Chapter XVII which deals with “collection and recovery”.

15. Now, Chapter XVII deals with “collection and recovery”. It covers tax deduction at source and advance payment of taxes (see Section

190). Part C Chapter XVII deals with advance payment of taxes. Section 207 refers to liability to pay advance tax whereas Section 209 deals with computation of advance tax. Section 215 refers to interest payable by the assessee. Section 210(1) inter alia provides that every person who is liable to pay interest (sic advance tax) under Section 208, shall of his own accord pay, on each of the due dates specified in Section 211, the appropriate percentage of advance tax on his current income calculated in the manner under Section 209.”

35. A catena of decisions by various High Courts has reiterated that the Advance Tax payable under Chapter XVII is based on an estimate of the total income of the assessee for the relevant financial year, and is not the final “total income” which must be disclosed for assessment through the filing of a return under Section 139 of the Act in the following assessment year. An estimate always has an element of guesswork. There could be various reasons due to which an estimate may be faulty and inaccurate which is why, there is a provision for payment of interest on deficient or excess payment of advance tax when there is variation between advance tax paid and actual liability to tax. [See: Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Smt. Premlata Jalani[5], Bill & Peggy Marketing India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax[6], Prime Securities Ltd. Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax[7], Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Nilgiri Tea Estate Ltd.[8], Kwality Biscuits Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax[9] which was subsequently affirmed in Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Kwality Biscuits Ltd.[10]].

36. The Punjab and Haryana High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Upper India Steel Mfg. and Engg. Co. Ltd.[11] made the following important observations:

“24. We fully concur with the view expressed in the aforesaid judgments. The Madras High Court has correctly pointed out that for the purpose of payment of advance tax, all assessees including companies, are required to make an estimate of their current income. Even before the introduction of the provisions of Section 115J of the Act, companies had been estimating their total income after providing deductions admissible under the Act. In fact, all assessees who maintain books of account have to undertake this exercise for the purpose of payment of advance tax. If a profit and loss account can be drawn up on estimate basis for the purpose of Income-tax Act, it is not understood as to why a similar profit and loss account on estimate basis under the Companies Act cannot be drawn up. If the explanation of the companies that the profits under Section 115J of the Act can only be determined after the close of the year were to be accepted, then no assessee who maintains regular books of account would be liable to pay advance tax as in those cases also, income can only be determined after the close of the books of account at the end of the year.”

37. We are, therefore, of the view that since the Advance Tax payable by an assessee is an estimate of his “current income” for the relevant financial year, it is not the actual total income, to be disclosed in the return of income. To repeat, the vital distinction being that the “current income” is an estimation or approximation, which may not be accurate or final; whereas the “total income” is the exact income disclosed in a valid return, assessable by the Revenue. The fact that the “current income” is an estimation implies that it is not final and is subject to further adjustments in the form of additions or reductions, as the case may be, and would have to be succeeded by the disclosure of final and total income in a valid return. It will be a misconstruction of the law to construe the undisclosed income for purposes of Chapter XIVB as an “estimate” of the total income, which is assessable and chargeable to tax. Therefore, we are unable to accept that payment of Advance Tax based on “current income” involves the disclosure of “total income”, as defined in Section 2(45) of the Act, which has to be stated in the return of income. The same is evidenced in the scheme of Chapter XIVB, in particular.

38. Section 158BB(3) of the Act states-

(3) The burden of proving to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that any undisclosed income had already been disclosed in any return of income filed by the assessee before the commencement of search or of the requisition, as the case may be, shall be on the assessee.
39. Thus, for the purposes of computation of undisclosed income under Chapter XIVB, an assessee can rebut the Assessing Officer’s finding of undisclosed income by showing that such income was disclosed in the return of income filed by him before the commencement of search or the requisition. In other words, when Section 158BB(3) is read with Section 158B(b), which defines undisclosed income, we reach the conclusion that for income to be considered as disclosed income, the same should have been disclosed in the return filed by the assessee before the search or requisition. In our opinion, on failure to file return of income by the due date under Section 139 of the Act, payment of Advance Tax per se cannot indicate the intention of an assessee to disclose his income.

40. If we were to hold that the payment of Advance Tax reflects the intention of the assessee to disclose its income, it could result in a situation where the mandatory obligation of filing a return for disclosure of income under the provisions of the Act, would not be necessary. It will be open to an assessee to contend that payment of Advance Tax is tantamount to disclosure of income. Such a proposition would be contrary to the very purpose of filing of return, which ultimately leads to assessment of total income for the relevant assessment year. Any anomaly in the return entails serious consequences, which may not otherwise be attracted on estimation of income for the purpose of payment of Advance Tax. It would thus, be difficult to accept the plea that payment of Advance Tax is tantamount to the disclosure of income or that it indicates the intention of the assessee to disclose income.

41. In the instant case, after the search was conducted on 23rd February 2006, it was found that for the assessment year 1995-96, the respondent-assessee had not filed its return of income by the due date. It is only when block assessment proceedings were initiated by the assessing officer, that the assessee filed its return for the said assessment year on 11th July, 1996 under Section 158BC of the Act, showing its total income as Rs.7,02,768/-. The assessee claimed, that since Advance Tax had been paid in three installments, it could not have been said that the income had not been disclosed or that there was no intention to disclose income. We have already held that the payment of Advance Tax, which is based upon estimated income, cannot tantamount to the disclosure of the total income, which must be declared in the return. In our opinion, the fact that the assessee had not filed its return of income by the due date, the Assessing Officer was correct in assuming that the assessee would not have disclosed its total income. For all these reasons, the decision of the High Court cannot be sustained.

42. Lastly, since C.A. No. 2580/2010 refers to a slightly different issue, we deem it fit to record our observations with respect to the same. In this appeal, the issue is whether tax deducted at source (and not payment of Advance Tax) amounts to the disclosure of income.

43. Section 190 of the Act states-

190 (1) Notwithstanding that the regular assessment in respect of any income is to be made in a later assessment year, the tax on such income shall be payable by deduction [12][or collection] at source or by advance payment [13][or by payment under sub-section (1A) of section 192], as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
(2) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the charge of tax on such income under the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 4.
44. Since the tax to be deducted at source is also computed on the estimated income of an assessee for the relevant financial year, such deduction cannot result in the disclosure of the total income for the relevant assessment year. Subject to the monetary limit of the total income, every person is obligated to file his return of income even after tax is deducted at source. Hence, for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs, we are of the opinion that mere deduction of tax at source, also, does not amount to disclosure of income, nor does it indicate the intention to disclose income most definitely when the same is not disclosed in the returns filed for the concerned assessment year.

45. Consequently, we allow the appeals; set aside the impugned judgments and answer the question formulated by the High Court, extracted in para 6 (supra), in favour of the Revenue. The Revenue shall be entitled to costs, quantified at Rs.50,000/- in each set of appeals.",1
M/S I.C.D.S. LTD.,"1. In all these appeals, by grant of special leave, by the Revenue, the common question of law relates to the claim of the assessee for depreciation under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short “the Act”). The assessment years involved are 1991-1992 to 1996-1997.

2. The assessee is a public limited company, classified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a non-banking finance company. It is engaged in the business of hire purchase, leasing and real estate etc. The vehicles, on which depreciation was claimed, are stated to have been purchased by the assessee against direct payment to the manufacturers. The assessee, as a part of its business, leased out these vehicles to its customers and thereafter, had no physical affiliation with the vehicles. In fact, lessees were registered as the owners of the vehicles, in the certificate of registration issued under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as “the MV Act”).

3. In its return of income for the relevant assessment years, the assessee claimed, among other heads, depreciation in relation to certain assets, (additions made to the trucks) which, as explained above, had been financed by the assessee but registered in the name of third parties. The assessee also claimed depreciation at a higher rate on the ground that the vehicles were used in the business of running on hire.

4. The Assessing Officer disallowed claims, both of depreciation and higher rate, on the ground that the assessee’s use of these vehicles was only by way of leasing out to others and not as actual user of the vehicles in the business of running them on hire. It had merely financed the purchase of these assets and was neither the owner nor user of these assets. Aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeals to the Commissioner of Income Tax. In so far as the question of depreciation at normal rate was concerned, the Commissioner (Appeals) agreed with the assessee. However, assessee’s claim for depreciation at higher rate did not find favour with the Commissioner.

5. Being dissatisfied, both the assessee and the Revenue carried the matter further in appeal before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (for short “the Tribunal”). The Tribunal agreed with the assessee on both the counts. On the question of claim for depreciation on normal rate, the following observations by the Tribunal are very significant:

“…In the present case the business of the assessee-appellant is leasing and hiring of vehicles and other machinery. It is definitely not a hire purchase, as seen from the lease agreements, copies of some of which are on record. Further, allowing only depreciation is not the matter of dispute in the instant case. The lower authorities have already allowed the depreciation, of course in the normal rates. Therefore, ownership of the vehicles and its use is not at all disputed at any stage before the Assessing Officer and the first appellate authority.

Nothing is brought on record, whether the lessees of the vehicles have claimed the depreciation which were used by them. From this the only inference that can be drawn is that the lessees have not claimed depreciation and it is the appellant alone who has claimed the depreciation being the actual owner of the vehicles.” On the higher rate of depreciation, the Tribunal culled out the observations of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as under:

“The CIT (Appeals) considered that the appellant has only financed to purchase the trucks. Therefore, according to him, leasing out the trucks or hiring them does not assume the character of doing business of hiring the trucks. According to the CIT (Appeals) the appellant must use the trucks for its own business of running them on hire to claim the higher rate of depreciation. But the main activity of the appellant is to lease out or give the trucks on hire to others.
*** *** *** … In the opinion of the CIT (Appeals), the language used in the rules clearly specified that enhanced depreciation allowance is available only when the trucks are used in the business of running them on hire also. The appellant has only a leasing business and it does not run a business of hiring trucks to the public. According to the department the distinction is very clear and there is no case for the appellant to claim the enhanced depreciation on the business of hiring the trucks.”
6. Relying on the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Karnataka, Bangalore Vs. Shaan Finance (P) Ltd., Bangalore[1], the Tribunal held that the assessee, having used the trucks for the purpose of business, was entitled to a higher rate of depreciation at 50% on the trucks leased out by it.

7. Being aggrieved, the revenue preferred an appeal to the High Court under Section 260A of the Act. The High Court framed the following substantial questions of law for its adjudication:-

“Whether the Appellant (assessee) is the owner of the vehicles which are leased out by it to its customers and Whether the Appellant (assessee) is entitled to the higher rate of depreciation on the said vehicles, on the ground that they were hired out to the Appellant’s customers.”

8. Answering both the questions in favour of the revenue, the High Court held that in view of the fact that the vehicles were not registered in the name of the assessee, and that the assessee had only financed the transaction, it could not be held to be the owner of the vehicles, and thus, was not entitled to claim depreciation in respect of these vehicles. Hence, these appeals by the assessee.

9. Section 32 of the Act on depreciation, pertinent for the controversy at hand, reads as follows:

“32.(1) In respect of depreciation of—

(i)   buildings, machinery, plant or furniture, being tangible assets;

(ii)   know-how, patents, copyrights, trade marks, licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature, being intangible assets acquired on or after the 1st day of April, 1998, owned, wholly or partly, by the assessee and used for the purposes of the business or profession, the following deductions shall be allowed-

i) in the case of assets of an undertaking engaged in generation or generation and distribution of power, such percentage on the actual cost thereof to the assessee as may be prescribed ;]
ii) in the case of any block of assets, such percentage on the written down value thereof as may be prescribed  Provided that no deduction shall be allowed under this clause in respect of—
(a) any motor car manufactured outside India, where such motor car is acquired by the assessee after the 28th day of February, 1975 but before the 1st day of April, 2001, unless it is used—
i) in a business of running it on hire for tourists ; or
ii) outside India in his business or profession in another country ; and
(b) any machinery or plant if the actual cost thereof is allowed as a deduction in one or more years under an agreement entered into by the Central Government under section 42  Provided further that where an asset referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) or clause (iia) as the case may be, is acquired by the assessee during the previous year and is put to use for the purposes of business or profession for a period of less than one hundred and eighty days in that previous year, the deduction under this sub-
section in respect of such asset shall be restricted to fifty per cent of the amount calculated at the percentage prescribed for an asset under clause (i) or clause (ii) [or clause (iia)], as the case may be.” (Emphasis supplied)

10. Depreciation is the monetary equivalent of the wear and tear suffered by a capital asset that is set aside to facilitate its replacement when the asset becomes dysfunctional. In P.K. Badiani Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay[2], this Court has observed that allowance for depreciation is to replace the value of an asset to the extent it has depreciated during the period of accounting relevant to the assessment year and as the value has, to that extent, been lost, the corresponding allowance for depreciation takes place.

11. Black’s Law Dictionary (5th Edn.) defines ‘depreciation’ to mean, inter alia:

“A fall in value; reduction of worth. The deterioration or the loss or lessening in value, arising from age, use, and improvements, due to better methods. A decline in value of property caused by wear or obsolescence and is usually measured by a set formula which reflects these elements over a given period of useful life of property.... Consistent gradual process of estimating and allocating cost of capital investments over estimated useful life of asset in order to match cost against earnings...” The 6th Edition defines it, inter alia, in the following ways:

“In accounting, spreading out the cost of a capital asset over its estimated useful life.
A decline in the value of property caused by wear or obsolescence and is usually measured by a set formula which reflects these elements over a given period of useful life of property.”
12. Parks in Principles & Practice of Valuation (Fifth Edn., at page 323) states: As for building, depreciation is the measurement of wearing out through consumption, or use, or effluxion of time. Paton has in his Account's Handbook (3rd Edn.) observed that depreciation is an out-of- pocket cost as any other costs. He has further observed-the depreciation charge is merely the periodic operating aspect of fixed asset costs.

13. The provision on depreciation in the Act reads that the asset must be “owned, wholly or partly, by the assessee and used for the purposes of the business”. Therefore, it imposes a twin requirement of ‘ownership’ and ‘usage for business’ for a successful claim under Section 32 of the Act.

14. The Revenue attacked both legs of this portion of the section by contending: (i) that the assessee is not the owner of the vehicles in question and (ii) that the assessee did not use these trucks in the course of its business. It was argued that depreciation can be claimed by an assessee only in a case where the assessee is both, the owner and user of the asset.

15. We would like to dispose of the second contention before considering the first. Revenue argued that since the lessees were actually using the vehicles, they were the ones entitled to claim depreciation, and not the assessee. We are not persuaded to agree with the argument. The Section requires that the assessee must use the asset for the “purposes of business”. It does not mandate usage of the asset by the assessee itself. As long as the asset is utilized for the purpose of business of the assessee, the requirement of Section 32 will stand satisfied, notwithstanding non-usage of the asset itself by the assessee. In the present case before us, the assessee is a leasing company which leases out trucks that it purchases. Therefore, on a combined reading of Section 2(13) and Section 2(24) of the Act, the income derived from leasing of the trucks would be business income, or income derived in the course of business, and has been so assessed. Hence, it fulfills the aforesaid second requirement of Section 32 of the Act viz. that the asset must be used in the course of business.

16. In the case of Shaan Finance (P) Ltd. (supra), this Court while interpreting the words “used for the purposes of business” in case of analogous provisions of Section 32A(2) and Section 33 of the Act, dealing with Investment Allowance and Development Rebate respectively, held thus:

-

“9. Sub-section (2) of Section 32-A, however, requires to be examined to see whether there is any provision in that sub-section which requires that the assessee should not merely use the machinery for the purposes of his business, but should himself use the machinery for the purpose of manufacture or for whatever other purpose the machinery is designed. Sub-section (2) covers all items in respect of which investment allowance can be granted. These items are, ship, aircraft or machinery or plant of certain kinds specified in that sub-section. In respect of a new ship or a new aircraft, Section 32-A(2)(a) expressly prescribes that the new ship or the new aircraft should be acquired by an assessee which is itself engaged in the business of operation of ships or aircraft. Under sub-section (2)(b), however, any such express requirement that the assessee must himself use the plant or machinery is absent. Section 32-A(2)(b) merely describes the new plant or machinery which is covered by Section 32-A. The plant or machinery is described with reference to its purpose. For example, sub- section (2)(b)(i) prescribes “the purposes of business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power”. Sub- section (2)(b)(ii) refers to small-scale industrial undertakings which may use the machinery for the business or manufacture or production of any article, and sub-section (2)(b)(iii) refers to the business of construction, manufacture or production of any article or thing other than that specified in the Eleventh Schedule. Sub-section 2(b), therefore, refers to the uses to which the machinery can be put. It does not specify that the assessee himself should use the machinery for these purposes. In the present case, the person to whom the machinery is hired does use the machinery for specified purposes under Section 32-A(2)(b)(iii). That person, however, is not the owner of the machinery. The High Courts of Karnataka and Madras have held that looking to the requirements specified in Section 32-A the assessees, in the present case, fulfil all the requirements of that section, namely, (1) the machinery is owned by the assessees; (2) the machinery is used for the purpose of the assessees' business and; (3) the machinery is as specified in sub-section (2).

10. We are inclined to agree with this reasoning of the High Courts of Karnataka and Madras.”

17. The same judgment commented on the analogous nature of Section 33 on Development Rebate and clarified that the phrase “used for the purpose of business” does not necessarily require a usage of the asset itself. It held thus:

“11. The provisions relating to investment allowance are akin to the provisions under Section 33 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relating to development rebate… *** *** ***

12. Since the provisions of Section 33 dealing with development rebate are similar to the provisions of Section 32-A, it is necessary to look at cases dealing with the grant of development rebate under Section

33. In the case of CIT v. Castlerock Fisheries (1980) 126 ITR 382 the Kerala High Court considered the case of an assessee which temporarily let out its cold-storage plant to a sister concern. The income derived by such letting was assessed by the Income Tax Officer in the hands of the assessee as business income of the assessee for the relevant accounting years. The assessee claimed development rebate in respect of the cold-storage plant. The High Court said that it was accepted by the department that in letting out the plant and machinery, the assessee was still doing business and the hire charges which it had received, had been assessed as business income of the assessee. Hence the assessee had complied with all the conditions for the grant of development rebate including the condition that the assessee had used the machinery for the purposes of its business. The High Court said that it must, therefore, necessarily be assumed that the conditions laid down in Section 33(1)(a) that the machinery or plant is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by the assessee, is duly satisfied and the assessee is entitled to development rebate. In appeal before this Court, a Bench of three Judges of this Court upheld the decision of the Kerala High Court in the above case in CIT v. Castle Rock Fisheries (1997) 10 SCC 77. This Court also held that since the department has proceeded on the explicit basis that despite the fact that the plant had been temporarily let out by the assessee to a sister concern, the plant and machinery was nevertheless being used by the assessee for its business purpose by treating the income derived by the assessee by such letting out as business income of the assessee, the development rebate must be considered as having been rightly granted. Therefore, where the business of the assessee consists of hiring out machinery and/or where the income derived by the assessee from the hiring of such machinery is business income, the assessee must be considered as having used the machinery for the purposes of its business.

13. A similar view has been taken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of CIT v. Vinod Bhargava (1988) 169 ITR 549 (AP) where Jeevan Reddy, J. (as he then was) held that where leasing of machinery is a mode of carrying on business by the assessee the assessee would be entitled to development rebate. The Court observed (p. 551):

“[O]nce it is held that leasing out of the machinery is one mode of doing business by the assessee and the income derived from leasing out is treated as business income it would be contradictory, in terms, to say that the machinery is not used wholly for the purpose of the assessee's business.”
18. Hence, the assessee meets the second requirement discussed above. The assessee did use the vehicles in the course of its leasing business. In our opinion, the fact that the trucks themselves were not used by the assessee is irrelevant for the purpose of the section.

19. We may now advert to the first requirement i.e. the issue of ownership. No depreciation allowance is granted in respect of any capital expenditure which the assessee may be obliged to incur on the property of others. Therefore, the entire case hinges on the question of ownership; if the assessee is the owner of the vehicles, then he will be entitled to the claim on depreciation, otherwise, not.

20. In Mysore Minerals Ltd., M.G. Road, Bangalore Vs. Commissioners of Income Tax, Karnataka, Bangalore[3], this Court said thus:

“…authorities shows that the very concept the depreciation suggests that the tax benefit on account of depreciation legitimately belongs to one who has invested in the capital asset is utilizing the capital asset and thereby losing gradually investment caused by wear and tear, and would need to replace the same by having lost its value fully over a period of time.”

21. Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Edn.) defines 'owner' as under:

“Owner. The person in whom is vested the ownership, dominion, or title of property; proprietor. He who has dominion of a thing, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, which he has a right of enjoy and do with as he pleases, even to spoil or destroy it, as far as the law permits, unless he be prevented by some agreement or covenant which restrains his right.
The term is, however, a nomen generalissimum, and its meaning is to be gathered from the connection in which it is used, and from the subject- matter to which it is applied. The primary meaning of the word as applied to land is one who owns the fee and who has the right to dispose of the property, but the terms also included one having a possessory right to land or the person occupying or cultivating it.
The term ""owner"" is used to indicate a person in whom one or more interests are vested his own benefit. The person in whom the interests are vested has ‘title’ to the interests whether he holds them for his own benefit or the benefit of another. Thus the term “title” unlike “owner”..” It defines the term 'ownership' as – ""Collection of right to use and enjoy property, including right to transmit it to others.... The right of one or more persons to possess or use a thing to the exclusion of others. The right by which a thing belongs to some one in particular, to the exclusion of all other persons. The exclusive right of possession, enjoyment or disposal; involving as an essential attribute the right to control, handle, and dispose.""

The same dictionary defines the term “own” as ‘To have a good legal title’.

These definitions essentially make ownership a function of legal right or title against the rest of the world. However, as seen above, it is “nomen generalissimum, and its meaning is to be gathered from the connection in which it is used, and from the subject-matter to which it is applied.”

22. A scrutiny of the material facts at hand raises a presumption of ownership in favour of the assessee. The vehicle, along with its keys, was delivered to the assessee upon which, the lease agreement was entered into by the assessee with the customer. Moreover, the relevant clauses of the agreement between the assessee and the customer specifically provided that:

(i) The assessee was the exclusive owner of the vehicle at all points of time;

(ii) If the lessee committed a default, the assessee was empowered to re-possess the vehicle (and not merely recover money from the customer);

iii) At the conclusion of the lease period, the lessee was obliged to return the vehicle to the assessee;

iv) The assessee had the right of inspection of the vehicle at all times.

For the sake of ready reference, the relevant clauses of the lease agreement are extracted hereunder:-

“2. Lease Rent The lessee shall, during the period of lease punctually pay to the lessor free of any deduction whatsoever as rent for the assets the sum of moneys specified in the Schedule ‘B’ hereto. All rents shall be paid at the address of the Lessor shown above or as otherwise directed by the Lessor in writing. The rent shown in Schedule ‘B’ shall be paid month on 1st day of each month and the first rent shall be paid on execution thereof.
4. Ownership The assets shall at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of the lessor and the lessee shall have no right, title or interest to mortgage, hypothecate or sell the same as bailee
9. Inspection The Lessor shall have the right at all reasonable time to enter upon any premises where the assets is believed to be kept and inspect and/or test the equipment and/or observe its use.
18. Default If the lessee shall make default in payment of moneys or rent payable under the provisions of this agreement, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor on the sum or sums in arrears compensation at the rate of 3% per month until payment thereof, such compensation to run from the day to day without prejudice to the lessor’s rights under any terms, conditions and agreements herein expressed or implied. All costs incurred by the Lessor in obtaining payment of such arrears or in endeavoring to trace the whereabouts of the equipments or in obtaining or endeavouring to obtain possession thereof whether by action, suit or otherwise, shall be recoverable from the lessee in addition to and without prejudice to the lessors right for breach of this lease.
19. Expiration of Lease:
Upon the expiration of this Lease, the Lessee shall deliver to the Lessor the assets at such place as the Lessor may specify in good repair, condition and working order. As soon as the return of the asset the Lessor shall refund the amount of security deposit. If the lessee fails to deliver the equipment to the Lessor in accordance with any direction given by the Lessor, the Lessee shall be deemed to be the tenant of the assets at the same rental and upon the same terms herein expressed and such tenancy may be terminated by the Lessor immediately upon default by the lessee hereunder or upon 7 days notice previously given..”
23. The Revenue’s objection to the claim of the assessee is founded on the lease agreement. It argued that at the end of the lease period, the ownership of the vehicle is transferred to the lessee at a nominal value not exceeding 1% of the original cost of the vehicle, making the assessee in effect a financer. However we are not persuaded to agree with the Revenue. As long as the assessee has a right to retain the legal title of the vehicle against the rest of the world, it would be the owner of the vehicle in the eyes of law. A scrutiny of the sale agreement cannot be the basis of raising question against the ownership of the vehicle. The clues qua ownership lie in the lease agreement itself, which clearly point in favour of the assessee. We agree with the following observations of the Tribunal in this regard:

“20. It is evident from the above that after the lessee takes possession of the vehicle under a lease deed from the appellant-company it (sic.) shall be paying lease rent as prescribed in the schedule. The ownership of the vehicles would vest with the appellant-company viz., ICDS as per clause (4) of the agreement of lease. As per clause (9) of the Lease agreement, M/s. ICDS is having right of inspection at any time it wants. As per clause (18) of the Lease agreement, in case of default of lease rent, in addition to expenses, interest etc. the appellant company is entitled to take possession of the vehicle that was leased out. Finally, as per clause (19), on the expiry of the lease tenure, the lessee should return the vehicle to the appellant company in working order.

21. It is true that a lease of goods or rental or hiring agreement is a contract under which one party for reward allows another the use of goods. A lease may be for a specified period or in perpetuity. A lease differs from a hire purchase agreement in that lessee or hirer, is not given an option to purchase the goods. A hiring agreement or lease unlike a hire purchase agreement is a contract of bailment, plain and simple with no element of sale inherent. A bailment has been defined in S.148 of the Indian Contract Act, as “the delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them.

22. From the above discussion, it is clear that the transactions occurring in the business of the assessee-appellant are leases under agreement, but not hire purchase transactions. In fact, they are transactions of ‘hire’. Even viewed from the angle of the author of ‘Lease Financing and Hire Purchase’, the views of whom were discussed in pages 16 and 17 of this order, the transactions involved in the appellant business are nothing but lease transactions.

23. As far as the factual portion is concerned now we could come to a conclusion that leasing of vehicles is nothing but hiring of vehicles. These two aspects are one and the same. However, we shall discuss the case law cited by both the parties on the point.”

24. The only hindrance to the claim of the assessee, which is also the lynchpin of the case of the Revenue, is Section 2(30) of the MV Act, which defines ownership as follows: -

““owner” means a person in whose name a motor vehicle stands registered, and where such person is a minor, the guardian of such minor, and in relation to a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, or an agreement of lease or an agreement of a hypothecation, the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.”

25. The general opening words of the Section say that the owner of a motor vehicle is the one in whose name it is registered, which, in the present case, is the lessee. The subsequent specific statement on leasing agreements states that in respect of a vehicle given on lease, the lessee who is in possession shall be the owner. The Revenue thus, argued that in case of ownership of vehicles, the test of ownership is the registration and certification. Since the certificates were in the name of the lessee, they would be the legal owners of the vehicles and the ones entitled to claim depreciation. Therefore, the general and specific statements on ownership construe ownership in favour of the lessee, and hence, are in favour of the Revenue.

26. We do not find merit in the Revenue’s argument for more than one reason: (i) Section 2(30) is a deeming provision that creates a legal fiction of ownership in favour of lessee only for the purpose of the MV Act. It defines ownership for the subsequent provisions of the MV Act, not for the purpose of law in general. It serves more as a guide to what terms in the MV Act mean. Therefore, if the MV Act at any point uses the term owner in any Section, it means the one in whose name the vehicle is registered and in the case of a lease agreement, the lessee. That is all. It is not a statement of law on ownership in general. Perhaps, the repository of a general statement of law on ownership may be the Sale of Goods Act; (ii) Section 2(30) of the MV Act must be read in consonance with sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 51 of the MV Act, which were referred to by Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel for the assessee. The provisions read as follows: -

“(4) No entry regarding the transfer of ownership of any motor vehicle which is held under the said agreement shall be made in the certificate of registration except with the written consent of the person whose name has been specified in the certificate of registration as the person with whom the registered owner has entered into the said agreement.

(5) Where the person whose name has been specified in the certificate of registration as the person with whom the registered owner has entered into the said agreement, satisfies the registering authority that he has taken possession of the vehicle  from the registered owner owing to the default of the registered owner under the provisions of the said agreement and that the registered owner refuses to deliver the certificate of registration or has absconded, such authority may, after giving the registered owner an opportunity to make such representation as he may wish to make (by sending to him a notice by registered post acknowledgment due at his address entered in the certificate of registration) and notwithstanding that the certificate of registration is not produced before it, cancel the certificate and issue a fresh certificate of registration in the name of the person with whom the registered owner has entered into the said agreement:

Provided that a fresh certificate of registration shall not be issued in respect of a motor vehicle, unless such person pays the prescribed fee:

Provided further that a fresh certificate of registration issued in respect of a motor vehicle, other than a transport vehicle, shall be valid only for the remaining period for which the certificate cancelled under this sub-section would have been in force.” Therefore, the MV Act mandates that during the period of lease, the vehicle be registered, in the certificate of registration, in the name of the lessee and, on conclusion of the lease period, the vehicle be registered in the name of lessor as owner. The Section leaves no choice to the lessor but to allow the vehicle to be registered in the name of the lessee Thus, no inference can be drawn from the registration certificate as to ownership of the legal title of the vehicle; and (iii) if the lessee was in fact the owner, he would have claimed depreciation on the vehicles, which, as specifically recorded in the order of the Appellate Tribunal, was not done. It would be a strange situation to have no claim of depreciation in case of a particular depreciable asset due to a vacuum of ownership. As afore- noted, the entire lease rent received by the assessee is assessed as business income in its hands and the entire lease rent paid by the lessee has been treated as deductible revenue expenditure in the hands of the lessee. This reaffirms the position that the assessee is in fact the owner of the vehicle, in so far as Section 32 of the Act is concerned.

27. Finally, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee also pointed out a large number of cases, accepted and unchallenged by the Revenue, wherein the lessor has been held as the owner of an asset in a lease agreement. [Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. A.M. Constructions[4]; Commissioner of Income- Tax Vs. Bansal Credits Ltd.[5]; Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. M.G.F. (India) Ltd.[6]; Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. Annamalai Finance Ltd.[7]]. In each of these cases, the leasing company was held to be the owner of the asset, and accordingly held entitled to claim depreciation and also at the higher rate applicable on the asset hired out. We are in complete agreement with these decisions on the said point.

28. There was some controversy regarding the invoices issued by the manufacturer – whether they were issued in the name of the lessee or the lessor. For the view we have taken above, we deem it unnecessary to go into the said question as it is of no consequence to our final opinion on the main issue. From a perusal of the lease agreement and other related factors, as discussed above, we are satisfied of the assessee’s ownership of the trucks in question.

29. Therefore, in the facts of the present case, we hold that the lessor i.e. the assessee is the owner of the vehicles. As the owner, it used the assets in the course of its business, satisfying both requirements of Section 32 of the Act and hence, is entitled to claim depreciation in respect of additions made to the trucks, which were leased out.

30. With regard to the claim of the assessee for a higher rate of depreciation, the import of the same term “purposes of business”, used in the second proviso to Section 32(1) of the Act gains significance. We are of the view that the interpretation of these words would not be any different from that which we ascribed to them earlier, under Section 32 (1) of the Act. Therefore, the assessee fulfills even the requirements for a claim of a higher rate of depreciation, and hence is entitled to the same.

31. In this regard, we endorse the following observations of the Tribunal, which clinch the issue in favour of the assessee.

“15. The CBDT vide Circular No. 652, dated 14-6-1993 has clarified that the higher rate of 40% in case of lorries etc. plying on hire shall not apply if the vehicle is used in a non- hiring business of the assessee. This circular cannot be read out of its context to deny higher appreciation in case of leased vehicles when the actual use is in hiring business.

(Emphasis supplied) Perhaps, the author meant that when the actual use of the vehicle is in hire business, it is entitled for depreciation at a higher rate.

*** *** ***

39. The gist of the decision of the apex court in the case of Shaan Finance (P) Ltd. is that where the business of the assessee consists of hiring out machinery and/ or where the income derived by the assessee from the hiring of such machinery is business income, the assessee must be considered as having used the machinery for the purpose of business.

40. In the present case, the business of the assessee consists of hiring out machinery and trucks where the income derived by the assessee from hiring of such machinery is business income. Therefore, the assessee- appellant viz. ICDS should be considered as having used the trucks for the purpose of business.

41. It was further brought to our notice that the Hon’ble Karnataka High Court in its judgment in ITRC No. 789 of 1998 for the asst. year 1986- 87 in the case of the assessee- appellant itself (viz. ICDS) has already decided the issue in question in favour of the assessee, confirming the decision of the CIT (A) and the ITAT holding that the assessee company is entitled to the investment allowance and additional depreciation. In this judgment of the Karnataka High Court the decision of the Supreme Court reported in 231 ITR 308 was relied upon. Therefore we have no hesitation to hold that the appellant- company is entitled to a higher rate of depreciation at 50% on the trucks leased out by it. We therefore, reverse the orders of the CIT (Appeals) on this issue.”

32. For the foregoing reasons, in our opinion, the High Court erred in law in reversing the decision of the Tribunal. Consequently, the appeals are allowed; the impugned judgments are set aside and the substantial questions of law framed by the High Court, extracted in para 7 (supra), are answered in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. There will, however, be no order as to costs.",0
Mohinder Singh,"1) These appeals are filed against the common final judgment and order dated 30.05.2008 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Murder Reference No. 8 of 2007 and Criminal Appeal No. 1033- DB of 2007 whereby the High Court accepted the murder reference and confirmed the death sentence imposed on the appellant herein by the Sessions Judge, Ludhiana by order dated 22.11.2007 in Session Case No. 32 of 2006 and dismissed the appeal filed by him.

2) Brief facts:

(a) According to the prosecution, on 08.01.2006, the appellant-accused has committed murder of his wife-Veena Verma and daughter-Geetu Verma in the background of inimical relationship between them on account of criminal cases registered against him by his wife for committing rape on his minor daughter–Geetu Verma, for which he was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 12 years, and for attacking her after release on parole in January, 2005 for which an FIR was registered against him.

(b) On the date of incident, i.e., 08.01.2006, at around 06:30 p.m., when Shalu Verma-the complainant, daughter of the appellant-accused was present along with her mother-Veena Verma and sister-Geetu Verma in their house at village Partap Singh Wala, Haibowal, Ludhiana, at that time, the appellant- accused, who was living separately in a rented accommodation, came to the said place carrying a Kulhara (axe) in his hand. The complainant informed her mother about the same. When Veena Verma came to the lobby of the house, the appellant-accused gave an axe blow on her head. She fell on the ground and, thereafter, he gave two more blows using axe on her neck and hand. Immediately after that, he stepped towards Geetu Verma and gave 3 repeated blows on her head. Both of them smeared with blood and died on the spot. When he approached Shalu, she went into the room and bolted the same from inside. The appellant-accused fled away leaving the axe at the spot. After sometime, she came outside the room and raised hue and cry.

(c) On the basis of the statement of Shalu (PW-2), a First Information Report (FIR) being No. 6 was registered against the appellant-accused under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short “the IPC”) at P.S. Haibowal, Ludhiana. On the same day, the appellant-accused was arrested from his rented house and the case was committed to the Court of Session, Ludhiana and numbered as Session Case No. 32 of 2006

(d) The Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, by order dated 22.11.2007, convicted the appellant under Section 302 of IPC and sentenced him to death.

(e) Against the said order, the appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court and the State filed a reference under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short ‘the Code’) for confirmation of death sentence. By a common impugned order dated 30.05.2008, the High Court while accepting the murder reference confirmed the death reference imposed by the trial Court and dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant-accused.

(f) Aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant preferred these appeals by way of special leave before this Court.

(g) This Court, by order dated 20.07.2009, issued notice on the special leave petitions confining to sentence only. Even on 16.07.2010 when this Court granted leave, nothing has been stated about the above said initial notice. Hence, in these appeals, we are concerned about the quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant.

3) Heard Mr. Tripurari Raj, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. V. Madhukar, learned Additional Advocate General for the respondent-State.

4) Though at the outset, learned counsel for the appellant insisted us to go into the entire merits of the case including the circumstances relied on by the prosecution and accepted by the Courts below, in view of the fact that this Court has issued notice confining to sentence only, we rejected his plea.

5) We are conscious of the fact that in terms of Section 366(1) of the Code, when the Court of Session passes a sentence of death, the proceedings shall be submitted to the High Court, and the sentence shall not be executed unless it is confirmed by the High Court. The scope and application of the above section is only in cases where a sentence of death has been passed by the Court of Session. The Court of Session should refer the proceedings to the High Court and the High Court can only deal with them as a Court of reference. It is the practice of the High Court to be satisfied on the facts as well as the law of the case, that the conviction is right, before it proceeds to confirm that sentence. In other words, the High Court has to come to its own independent conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, independently of the opinion of the Judge. In a reference for confirmation of death sentence, the High Court must examine the entire evidence for itself independent of the Session Court’s views. While confirming the capital sentence, the High Court is under an obligation to itself consider what sentence should be imposed and not be content with the trial Court’s decision on the point unless some reason is shown for reducing the same. Where, in addition to an appeal filed by an accused sentenced to death, the High Court has to dispose of the reference for confirmation of death sentence under Section 366 of the Code, the High Court, while dealing with reference, should consider the proceedings in all its aspects and come to an independent conclusion on the material on record apart from the views expressed by the Sessions Judge. The confirmation of death sentence cannot be based only on the precedents and or aggravating facts and circumstances of any other case.

6) Keeping the above principles in mind, let us analyze the materials placed before the trial Judge as well as the confirmation order of the High Court. In view of the limited notice and in the light of the mandates provided under Section 366 of the Code relating to confirmation of death sentence by the High Court, we are of the view that considering two earlier orders passed by this Court on 20.07.2009 and 16.07.2010 confining to the sentence, we intend to concentrate only to the question, namely, acceptability or otherwise of the “sentence” hereunder.

7) No doubt, it is a case of double murder by the appellant-accused who murdered his wife and daughter in a gruesome manner in the background of inimical relationship between the family on account of criminal cases registered against the appellant-accused at the instance of his deceased wife – Veena Verma and deceased daughter- Geetu Verma for which he was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 12 years’ for committing rape on his daughter-Geetu Verma. In that case his deceased wife was a witness. It is seen that after release on parole in January, 2005, he attacked on his wife and an FIR was registered against him for violating the conditions of release. It is further seen that the accused committed the offence in the presence of his youngest daughter Shalu (PW-2). It is also proved that the appellant had entered the scene of occurrence to commit the said offence carrying a deadly weapon i.e. ‘Kulhara’ (Axe) which was used in the commission of both the killings. The members present in the house were his family members, viz., wife and two daughters.

8) We noticed the following special reasons given by the trial Court for warranting the death sentence and the High Court for confirming the same which are as follows:

i) The appellant-accused had earlier committed rape on his deceased daughter – Geetu Verma in the year 1999 when she was a minor after giving beatings and threat to her and in that case his wife-Veena Verma (since deceased) was a witness and that a case under Sections 376 and 506 IPC was registered against him which finally resulted in rigorous imprisonment for 12 years.

ii) While on parole in January 2005, the appellant-accused having violated the conditions of release, attacked his wife-Veena Verma and an FIR being No. 58 dated 06.04.2005 was registered against him under Sections 323, 324 and 506 IPC which is pending in the Court of JMIC, Ludhiana on the date of alleged occurrence.

iii) The appellant-accused entered into the house with a deadly weapon ‘Kulhara’ (Axe) and caused unprovoked brutal attacks on the victims.

iv) The appellant-accused caused repeated blows on the vital parts of the body of his wife and daughter resulting in instantaneous deaths in the presence of his youngest daughter of tender age, who by running into a room and bolting its from inside, saved herself when the accused proceeded towards her.

v) The appellant-accused gave first blow to his wife – Veena Verma from behind with Kulhara (axe) on her head and when she fell down on the ground he caused successive blows on her neck and the head and, thereafter, he attacked his daughter–Geetu Verma and caused repeated Kulhara blows till her death. Thereafter, he proceeded towards his youngest daughter Shalu (PW-2) and showed Kulhara to her, who ran into a room and bolted it from inside.

vi) In the case of the deceased - Veena Verma, out of 4 incised wounds, Injury Nos. 1 & 2 were caused on head, Injury No.3 on neck and Injury No. 4 resulted in partial amputation of left index finger from 1/3rd with clean cut margins. Regarding the deceased - Geetu Verma, who had been earlier subjected to diabolical act of rape by the appellant-accused during her minority in 1999, as many as 9 injuries were caused, out of which 7 were incised wounds and 2 were abrasions. Further, out of 7 incised wounds 3 had been caused on head region itself, 1 on the left mastoid and rest 3 on left and right elbow and fingers. In both the cases, the victims died instantaneous death.

vii) Apart from taking revenge for his conviction and sentence, the appellant-accused has committed the offence for personal gain as he wanted the house, being occupied by his deceased wife and children, to be vacated for his personal use.

9) The crime of double murder of his wife and daughter in a gruesome and diabolical manner will irrefutably be taken into consideration as aggravating circumstance. However, for some reasons, the High Court did not find any mitigating circumstance in favour of the accused for the purpose of balancing aggravating against mitigating. Even, the High Court recorded at page 38 of the impugned order as under:-

“… In this background, looking for a strong mitigating circumstance, may not yield any result and this offence has in fact, ceased to remain a simple case of murder. This has rather acquired an enormity to the extent of rushing into the category of the “rarest of rare case.” It is pertinent to mention that in spite of the onerous duty bestowed on the reference court to balance the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the High Court evaded the same.
10) On the other hand, the Sessions Court had attempted to draw a balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances by stating two mitigating circumstances as follows:

1. Firstly, his age at the time of commission of crime i.e. 41 years.
2. Secondly, that the accused is a poor man, who had no livelihood.
While it is true that the above two circumstances alone will not make good for commuting the death sentence to life sentence, however, before we move on to enumerate the other mitigating circumstances in this case, it is necessary to consider few case laws which reiterate that brutality is not the sole criterion of determining whether a case falls under the “rarest of rare” categories.

11) In Panchhi & Ors. vs. State of U.P., (1998) 7 SCC 177, this Court held that brutality is not the sole criterion of determining whether a case falls under the “rarest of rare” categories, thereby justifying the commutation of a death sentence to life imprisonment. This Court observed:

“No doubt brutality looms large in the murders in this case particularly of the old and also the tender age child. It may be that the manner in which a murder was perpetrated may be a ground but not the sole criterion for judging whether the case is one of the “rarest of rare cases” as indicated in Bachan Singh’s case.”
12) The Constitution Bench of this Court, by a majority, upheld the constitutional validity of death sentence in Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684. This Court took particular care to say that death sentence shall not normally be awarded for the offence of murder and that it must be confined to the “rarest of rare” cases when the alternative option is foreclosed. In other words, the Constitution Bench did not find death sentence valid in all cases except in the aforesaid cases wherein the lesser sentence would be wholly inadequate.
13) In Machhi Singh and Ors. vs. State of Punjab, (1983) 3 SCC 470, a three-Judge Bench of this Court while following the ratio in Bachan Singh (supra) laid down certain guidelines amongst which the following is relevant in the present case:

“A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.”
14) We have extracted the above reasons of the two courts only to point out that, in a way, every murder is brutal, and the difference between the one from the other may be on account of mitigating or aggravating features surrounding the murder.
15) In the instant case, as already mentioned, the accused had earlier committed rape on his deceased daughter-Geetu Verma in 1999 and in that case, his deceased wife - Veena Verma was a witness wherein the accused was convicted under Sections 376 and 506 IPC and sentenced to RI for 12 years. It is also subsequently taken on record that his deceased wife sent the accused out of his house and as a consequence, he had to live separately in a rented house with no means of livelihood. It was thirst for retaliation, which became the motivating factor in this case. In no words are we suggesting that the motive of the accused was correct rather we feel it does not come within the category of “rarest of rare” case to award death penalty.

16) The doctrine of “rarest of rare” confines two aspects and when both the aspects are satisfied only then the death penalty can be imposed. Firstly, the case must clearly fall within the ambit of “rarest of rare” and secondly, when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed. Bachan Singh (supra) suggested selection of death punishment as the penalty of last resort when, alternative punishment of life imprisonment will be futile and serves no purpose.

17) In life sentence, there is a possibility of achieving deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution in different degrees. But the same does not hold true for the death penalty. It is unique in its absolute rejection of the potential of convict to rehabilitate and reform. It extinguishes life and thereby terminates the being, therefore, puts an end anything to do with the life. This is the big difference between two punishments. Thus, before imposing death penalty, it is imperative to consider the same.

18) “Rarest of rare” dictum, as discussed above, hints at this difference between death punishment and the alternative punishment of life imprisonment. The relevant question here would be to determine whether life imprisonment as a punishment would be pointless and completely devoid of any reason in the facts and circumstances of the case. As discussed above, life imprisonment can be said to be completely futile, only when the sentencing aim of reformation can be said to be unachievable. Therefore, for satisfying the second aspect to the “rarest of rare” doctrine, the court will have to provide clear evidence as to why the convict is not fit for any kind of reformatory and rehabilitation scheme.

19) Treating the case on the touchstone of the guidelines laid down in Bachan Singh (supra), Machhi Singh (supra) and other decisions and balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances emerging from the evidence on record, we are not persuaded to accept that the case can appropriately be called the “rarest of rare” case warranting death penalty. We also find it difficult to hold that the appellant is such a dangerous person that sparing his life will endanger the community. We are also not satisfied that the circumstances of the crime are such that there is no other alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances in favour of the accused. In our considered view, this case is the one in which humanist approach must be taken in the matter of awarding punishment.

20) It is well settled law that awarding of life sentence is a rule and death is an exception. The application of the “rarest of rare” case principle is dependant upon and differs from case to case. However, the principles laid down and reiterated in various decisions of this Court show that in a deliberately planned crime, executed meticulously in a diabolic manner, exhibiting inhuman conduct in a ghastly manner, touching the conscience of everyone and thereby disturbing the moral fiber of the society, would call for imposition of capital punishment in order to ensure that it acts as a deterrent. While we are convinced that the case of the prosecution based on the evidence adduced confirms the commission of offence by the appellant, however, we are of the considered opinion that still the case does not fall within the four corners of the “rarest of rare” case.

21) Life imprisonment cannot be equivalent to imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years or even 30 years, rather it always means the whole natural life. This Court has always clarified that the punishment of a fixed term of imprisonment so awarded would be subject to any order passed in exercise of clemency powers of the President of India or the Governor of the State, as the case may be. Pardons, reprieves and remissions under Article 72 or Article 161 of the Constitution of India are granted in exercise of prerogative power. As observed in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Sanjay Kumar, (2012) 8 SCC 537, there is no scope of judicial review of such orders except on very limited grounds such as the non-application of mind while passing the order, non-consideration of relevant material, or if the order suffers from arbitrariness. The power to grant pardons and to commute sentences is coupled with a duty to exercise the same fairly, reasonably and in terms of restrictions imposed in several provisions of the Code.

22) In order to check all arbitrary remissions, the Code itself provides several conditions. Sub-sections (2) to (5) of Section 432 of the Code lay down basic procedure for making an application to the appropriate Government for suspension or remission of sentence either by the convict or someone on his behalf. We are of the view that exercise of power by the appropriate Government under sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the Code cannot be suo motu for the simple reason that this is only an enabling provision and the same would be possible subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. Those conditions are mentioned either in the Jail Manual or in statutory rules. This Court in various decisions has held that the power of remission cannot be exercised arbitrarily. In other words, the decision to grant remission has to be well informed, reasonable and fair to all concerned. The statutory procedure laid down in Section 432 of the Code itself provides this check on the possible misuse of power by the appropriate Government. As rightly observed by this Court in Sangeet and Anr. vs. State of Haryana, 2012 (11) Scale 140, there is misconception that a prisoner serving life sentence has an indefeasible right to release on completion of either 14 years or 20 years imprisonment. A convict undergoing life imprisonment is expected to remain in custody till the end of his life, subject to any remission granted by the appropriate Government under Section 432 of the Code which in turn is subject to the procedural checks mentioned in the said provision and further substantive check in Section 433-A of the Code.

23) One significant factor in this case, which we should not loose sight of is that he did not harm his other daughter, namely, Shallu (PW-2) even though he had a good chance for the same. Further, it was highlighted that he being a poor man and unable to earn his livelihood since he was driven out of his house by his deceased wife. It is also his claim that if he was allowed to live in the house, he could easily meet both his ends and means, as the money which he was spending by paying rent would have been saved. It is his further grievance that his deceased wife was adamant and he should live outside and should not lead a happy married life and that was the reason that their relations were strained. This also shows that the accused was feeling frustrated because of the attitude of his wife and children. Moreover, the probability of the offender’s rehabilitation and reformation is not foreclosed in this case. Likewise, we can see from the affidavit filed by the sister of the accused that his family has not totally renounced as yet. This is also clear that pending the above appeals, the appellant-accused, through his sister – Pramjit Kaur, filed an application for modification of earlier orders of this Court dated 20.07.2009 and 16.07.2010 for widening the scope of the appeals and sought permission to raise all available grounds. For this application, only his sister – Pramjit Kaur has filed an affidavit strengthening the above points. As mentioned above, the affidavit of his sister shows that his family has not totally renounced him. Hence, there is a possibility for reformation in the present appellant. Keeping in mind all these materials, we do not think that the present case warrants the award of the death penalty.

24) For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that this is not a case where death penalty should be imposed. The appellant-accused, therefore, instead of being awarded death penalty, is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life, meaning thereby, the end of his life but subject to any remission granted by the appropriate Government satisfying the conditions prescribed in Section 432 of the Code and further substantiate check under Section 433-A of the Code by passing appropriate speaking orders. The appeals are disposed of on the above terms.

Fakkir Mohamed Ibrahim Kalifulla, J.

1. I had the opportunity of reading the judgment of my learned brother Justice P. Sathasivam who has dealt with the issue in extenso while modifying the death sentence to one of imprisonment for life i.e. till the end of his life. I only wish to supplement my views while fully endorsing and concurring with the judgment of His Lordship Justice P. Sathasivam. Since, the facts have been elaborately stated in the judgment of His Lordship Justice P. Sathasivam, I do not refer the same in detail. For the purpose of my reasoning, in toeing with the conclusion of His Lordship Justice P. Sathasivam, I only wish to refer to certain factors to support our conclusions.

2. These appeals were entertained on 20.07.2009, however, while issuing notice, the appeals were confined to sentence only. The appellant was found guilty of the offence under Section 302 IPC and was sentenced to death for committing the murder of his wife Veena Verma and his daughter Geetu Verma on 08.01.2006 in the area of Pratap Singh Wala, Ludhiana. The above appeals arose out of the confirmation of death sentence in Murder Reference No.8/2007 as well as the connected Criminal Appeal No.1033-DB of 2007 filed by the appellant.

3. It is necessary to state that the appellant indulged in grotesque crime of murdering his wife and daughter one after another on 08.01.2006. The motive for such a heinous crime was that there was a dispute between him and his wife Veena Verma as regards the house which he owned and that he was deprived of having access to his own house. In fact it was a matter of record that in the year 1999 there was an FIR against the appellant in FIR No.27 wherein the appellant was charged for offences under Sections 376 and 506 IPC for having committed rape on his deceased daughter Geetu Verma which ended in a conviction of 12 years rigorous imprisonment by judgment dated 15.05.2001. There was yet another FIR No.58 dated 06.04.2005 against the appellant for offences under Sections 323 and 506 IPC for having assaulted and for having given threat to his wife Veena Verma which was also proved as per Ex.PAA. There was yet another record of criminal case No.2531 dated 01.08.2005 (FIR No.58 of 2005) again for offences under Sections 323 and 324 IPC which was pending in the Court of JMIC, Ludhiana. In fact, the present offence of murder of his wife and daughter was committed by the appellant when he was on parole while undergoing rigorous imprisonment of 12 years for the conviction of the offence of rape of his daughter committed in the year 1999. It was also relevant to keep in mind that for holding the appellant guilty of the charge of murder of his wife and daughter apart from the other evidence, the evidence of his own minor daughter Shalu PW.2 who was an eye-witness to the occurrence weighed to very great extent along with the evidence of his own son Malkiat Singh PW.7.

4. The trial Court having noted the above factors held that having regard to his involvement in various criminal cases in the past as well as the gravity of the offence of murder of his own wife and daughter, whom the appellant felt were responsible for his conviction for the offence of rape committed on his own minor daughter, took the view by stating elaborate reasons as to why the case fell within the principles of ‘rarest of rare cases’ for the award of death sentence and inflicted the same on him.

5. The High Court after setting out the principles laid down in the celebrated Constitution Bench decisions of this Court in Bachan Singh Vs. State of Punjab – (1980) 2 SCC 684 and the subsequent judgment in Machhi Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab – (1983) 3 SCC 470 held that the murder reference deserved to be accepted and the death sentence was, therefore, confirmed. The Division Bench of the High Court took into account the circumstances which are to be kept in mind for applying the ‘rarest of the rare case’ theory based on the above referred two decisions and noted the same as under:

“I. Manner of commission of murder.

II. Motive for commission of murder.

Anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime. Magnitude of crime Personality of victim of murder.”

6. The High Court has also noted the injuries found on the body of the deceased insofar as it related to Veena Verma, the wife of the appellant, who suffered four incised wounds of which injury No. 1 was on the right lateral side and upper part of the neck and injury No.2 was on the head, third one was on the neck and fourth one resulted in partial amputation of left index finger from its lower one-third with clean cut margins. As far as the deceased daughter Geetu Verma is concerned, there were as many as nine injuries out of which seven were incised wounds and two were abrasions. Out of the seven incised wounds three were caused on the head region itself, fourth was on the left mastoid and the remaining three were on left and right elbow and fingers. Both the victims had instantaneous death. The basic grievance of the appellant was nothing but his desire to occupy his house which was occupied by none else than his own wife, daughters and son.

7. By noting the special reasons, the Division Bench held that the conduct of the appellant in causing the murder of his wife and daughter acquired enormity to the extent that the case was fully governed by the principle of ‘rarest of rare cases’ and ultimately held that the imposition of death sentence by the trial Court was fully justified.

8. In this context we analyzed the various principles laid down in the subsequent decisions reported in Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar Mishra Vs. State of Karnataka - (2008) 13 SCC 767, Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar Vs. State of Maharashtra -(2009) 6 SCC 498, Mohd. Farooq Abdul Gafur & Anr. Vs. State of Maharashtra -(2010) 14 SCC 641, Haresh Mohandas Rajput Vs. State of Maharashtra -(2011) 12 SCC 56, State of Maharashtra Vs. Goraksha Ambaji Adsul - AIR 2011 SC 2689 and the recent decision reported in Mohammed Ajmal Mohammadamir Kasab @ Abu Mujahid Vs. State of Maharashtra

- JT 2012 (8) SC 4. From conspectus consideration of the above decisions apart from the four principles laid down in Bachan Singh (supra) and also the requirement of a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the following principles are required to be borne in mind:

i) A conclusion as to the ‘rarest of rare’ aspect with respect to a matter shall entail identification of aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating both to the crime and the criminal.
ii) The expression ‘special reasons’ obviously means (‘exceptional reasons’) founded on the exceptionally grave circumstances of the particular case relating to the crime as well as the criminal.
iii) The decision in Ravji @ Ram Chandra Vs. State of Rajasthan – (1996) 2 SCC 175 which was subsequently followed in six other cases, namely, Shivaji @ Dadya Shankar Alhat Vs. State of Maharashtra - (2008) 15 SCC 269, Mohan Anna Chavan Vs. State of Maharashtra - (2008) 7 SCC 561, Bantu Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh - (2008) 11 SCC 113, Surja Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan -(1996) 6 SCC 271, Dayanidhi Bisoi Vs. State of Orissa - (2003) 9 SCC 310 and State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Sattan @ Satyendra & Ors. - (2009) 4 SCC 736 wherein it was held that it is only characteristics relating to crime, to the exclusion of the ones relating to criminal, which are relevant to sentencing in criminal trial, was rendered per incuriam qua Bachan Singh (supra) in the decision reported in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar (supra) at 529.
iv) Public opinion is difficult to fit in the ‘rarest of rare’ matrix. People’s perception of crime is neither an objective circumstance relating to crime nor to the criminal. Perception of public is extraneous to conviction as also sentencing, at least in capital sentencing according to the mandate of Bachan Singh (supra). (2009) 6 SCC 498 at p.535.
v) Capital sentencing is one such field where the safeguards continuously take strength from the Constitution. (2009) 6 SCC 498 at 539.
vi) The Apex Court as the final reviewing authority has a far more serious and intensive duty to discharge and the Court not only has to ensure that award of death penalty does not become a perfunctory exercise of discretion under Section 302 after an ostensible consideration of ‘rarest of rare’ doctrine, but also that the decision-making process survives the special rigours of procedural justice applicable in this regard. (2010) 14 SCC 641 at 692.
vii) The ‘rarest of rare’ case comes when a convict would be a menace and threat to the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of the society. The crime may be heinous or brutal but may not be in the category of “the rarest of the rare case”. There must be no reason to believe that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated and that he is likely to continue criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the society. 2011 (12) SCC 56 at p.63 para 20.
viii) Life sentence is the rule and the death penalty is the exception. The condition of providing special reasons for awarding death penalty is not to be construed linguistically but it is to satisfy the basic features of a reasoning supporting and making award of death penalty unquestionable.
(ix) The circumstances and the manner of committing the crime should be such that it pricks the judicial conscience of the Court to the extent that the only and inevitable conclusion should be awarding of death penalty.(AIR 2011 SC 2689)
(x) When the case falls under the category of ‘rarest of rare’ case penalty of death is clearly called for and any leniency shown in the matter of sentence would not only be misplaced but will certainly give rise to and foster a feeling of private revenge among the people leading to destabilization of the society.(AIR 1983 SC 585)
(xi) Death penalty has been held to be constitutionally valid. The test is what case would attract death penalty if not the case of the appellant. JT (2012) 8 SC 4.
9. Keeping the above settled principles in mind, when we examine the case on hand, it is needless to state that the conduct of the appellant, if analyzed, based on the previous crimes committed by him, we find that in the year 1999 as found by the courts below the appellant committed rape on his deceased daughter Geetu Verma when she was minor and that too after beating her. To which beastly action, unfortunately the other deceased (viz) his wife, was an eye-witness. One cannot comprehend to visualize a situation of such nature in which father himself committed rape on his own minor daughter in the presence of her own mother. The conduct of the appellant in the commission of the said offence was not only bordering on immorality of the highest order but would be extremely difficult for anyone to lightly brush aside such a conduct by stating that either it was committed in a fit of anger or rage or such other similar situation. If such grotesque offence of rape had been committed by anyone, other than the father himself, the victim would have had every opportunity to cry for solace in her father or mother. In this context, we are only reminded of the Tamil proverb “??????  ????? ??????? ???” which means in English “When the fence eats the crops”. When the father himself happens to be the assailant in the commission of such beastly crime, one can visualize the pathetic situation in which the girl would have been placed and that too when such a shameless act was committed in the presence of her own mother. When the daughter and the mother were able to get their grievances redressed by getting the appellant convicted for the said offence of rape one would have in the normal course expected the appellant to have displayed a conduct of remorse. Unfortunately, the subsequent conduct of the appellant when he was on parole disclosed that he approached the victims in a far more vengeful manner by assaulting the hapless victims which resulted in filing of an FIR once in the year 2005 and subsequently when he was on parole in the year 2006. The monstrous mindset of the appellant appears to have not subsided by mere assault on the victims who ultimately displayed his extreme inhuman behaviour by eliminating his daughter and wife in such a gruesome manner in which he committed the murder by inflicting the injuries on the vital parts of the body of the deceased and that too with all vengeance at his command in order to ensure that they met with instantaneous death. The nature of injuries as described in the postmortem report speaks for itself as to the vengeance with which the appellant attacked the hapless victims. He was not even prepared to spare his younger daughter (viz) PW-2 who, however, escaped the wrath of the appellant by bolting herself inside a room after she witnessed the grotesque manner in which the appellant took away the life of his wife and daughter.

10. Be that as it may when we come to the question of applying the various principles culled out from the decisions right from the Constitution Bench decision in Bachan Singh (supra) right up to the case Mohammed Ajmal Mohammadamir Kasab (supra) as held by my learned brother Justice P. Sathasivam for the various reasons referred to therein, we find that the case still does not fall within the category of ‘rarest of rare case’ though it calls for a stringent punishment. Therefore, while modifying the sentence from one of death penalty to that of life imprisonment till the end of his life we apply the earliest decision of this Court reported in Gopal Vinayak Godse Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.

- AIR 1961 SC 600 wherein this Court held in paragraph 5 as under:

“It does not say that transportation for life shall be deemed to be transportation for twenty years for all purposes; nor does the amended section which substitutes the words ‘imprisonment for life’ for ‘transportation for life’ enable the drawing of any such all-embracing fiction. A sentence of transportation for life or imprisonment for life must prima facie be treated as transportation or imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person’s natural life.”
11. The said principle was followed subsequently in Mohd. Munna Vs. Union of India and Ors. - (2005) 7 SCC 417. Applying the above decisions, we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant deserves to be sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life meaning thereby the end of his life subject, however, to remission granted by the appropriate Government satisfying the conditions prescribed in Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and further substantiate check under Section 433A of the Code by passing appropriate speaking orders.",1
"Asst. Engineer, Rajasthan Dev. Corp. & Anr.                      ……
Appellants
","The short question that arises for consideration in this appeal, by special leave, is where the workman had worked for only eight months as daily wager and his termination has been held to be in contravention of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, ‘ID Act’), whether the direction to the employer for reinstatement with continuity of service and 25 per cent back wages is legally sustainable.

2. We were not disposed to undertake the detailed exercise but the same has become necessary in view of very vehement contention of Mr. Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel for the respondent (workman), that reinstatement must follow where termination of a workman has been found to be in breach of Section 25-F of ID Act. He heavily relied upon three decisions of this Court in L. Robert D’Souza v. Executive Engineer, Southern Railway and Another[1], Harjinder Singh v. Punjab State Warehousing Corporation[2] and Devinder Singh v. Municipal Council, Sanaur[3] .

3. On behalf of the appellant, Ms. Shobha, learned counsel, challenged the finding of the Labour Court that the respondent had worked for 240 days continuously in the year preceding the date of termination. Alternatively, she submitted that the award of reinstatement with continuity of service and 25 per cent back wages in the facts of the case was unjustified as the respondent was only a daily wager; he worked for a very short period from 01.03.1991 to 31.10.1991 and for last more than 20 years he is not in the service due to interim orders. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. v. Mamni[4], Mahboob Deepak v. Nagar Panchayat, Gajraula and Another[5], Jagbir Singh v. Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board and Another[6], Senior Superintendent Telegraph (Traffic), Bhopal v. Santosh Kumar Seal and Others[7] and In-charge Officer and Another v. Shankar Shetty[8], she submitted that respondent was at best entitled to some compensation for unlawful termination.

4. It is not in dispute that respondent was engaged as a daily wager. The Labour Court, Bharatpur, in its award dated 28.06.2001 has recorded the findings that the respondent had worked as technician (Mistri) under the appellant for 240 days for the period from 01.03.1991 to 31.10.1991 and the termination of his service by an oral order on 31.10.1991 was violative of Section 25-F of the ID Act. We are not inclined to disturb the findings recorded by the Labour Court; we take them to be correct. The question, as noted above, is whether direction for reinstatement of respondent with continuity in service along with 25 per cent of back wages in view of the above findings is just and proper.

5. More than five decades back, this Court in Assam Oil Company Limited, New Delhi v. Its Workmen[9] observed that the normal rule in cases of wrongful dismissal was reinstatement but there could be cases where it would not be expedient to follow this normal rule and to direct reinstatement. Having regard to the facts of that case, this Court set aside the order of reinstatement although dismissal of the employee was found to be wrongful and awarded compensation.

6. In M/s. Hindustan Steels Ltd., Rourkela v. A.K. Roy and Others[10], this Court noted that there have been cases where reinstatement has not been considered as either desirable or expedient.

7. In M/s. Ruby General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Shri P.P. Chopra[11], this Court reiterated what was stated in Assam Oil Company Limited9. In paragraph 6 (pgs. 655-656) of the Report, this Court said :

“6. The normal rule is that in cases of invalid orders of dismissal industrial adjudication would direct reinstatement of a dismissed employee. Nevertheless, there would be cases where it would not be expedient to adopt such a course. Where, for instance, the office of the employer was comparatively a small one and the dismissed employee held the position of the secretary, a position of confidence and trust, and the employer had lost confidence in the concerned employee, reinstatement was held to be not fair to either party……………”
8. This Court in The Management of Panitole Tea Estate v. The Workmen[12], while dealing with the judicial discretion of the Labour Court or the Tribunal under ID Act in directing appropriate relief on setting aside the wrongful dismissal of a workman, stated in paragraph 5 (pgs. 746-

747) as follows:

“…. The question whether on setting aside the wrongful dismissal of a workman he should be reinstated or directed to be paid compensation is a matter within the judicial discretion of the Labour Court or the Tribunal, dealing with the industrial dispute, the general rule in the absence of any special circumstances being of reinstatement. In exercising this discretion, fairplay towards the employee on the one hand and interest of the employer, including considerations of discipline in the establishment, on the other, require to be duly safeguarded. This is necessary in the interest both of security of tenure of the employee and of smooth and harmonious working of the establishment. Legitimate interests of both of them have to be kept in view if the order is expected to promote the desired objective of industrial peace and maximum possible production. The past record of the employer, the nature of the alleged conduct for which action was taken against him, the grounds on which the order of the employer is set aside, the nature of the duties performed by the employee concerned and the nature of the industrial establishment are some of the broad relevant factors which require to be taken into consideration. The factors just stated are merely illustrative and it is not possible to exhaustively enumerate them. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and no hard and fast rule can be laid down to cover generally all conceivable contingencies……”
9. In M/s. Tulsidas Paul v.The Second Labour Court, W.B. and Others[13], this Court relied upon M/s. Hindustan Steels Ltd.10 and held as under:

“9. In Hindustan Steels Ltd. v. Roy [(1969) 3 SCC 513] we recently held, after considering the previous case-law, that though the normal rule, in cases where dismissal or removal from service is found to be unjustified, is reinstatement, Industrial Tribunals have the discretion to award compensation in unusual or exceptional circumstances where the tribunal considers, on consideration of the conflicting claims of the employer on the one hand and of the workmen on the other, reinstatement inexpedient or not desirable. We also held that no hard and fast rule as to which circumstances would constitute an exception to the general rule can be laid down as the tribunal in each case must, in a spirit of fairness and justice and in keeping with the objectives of industrial adjudication, decide whether it should, in the interest of justice, depart from the general rule.”
10. In L. Robert D’Souza1, this Court in paragraph 27 (pg. 664) held as under :

“27. ……….Therefore, assuming that he was a daily-rated worker, once he has rendered continuous uninterrupted service for a period of one year or more, within the meaning of Section 25-F of the Act and his service is terminated for any reason whatsoever and the case does not fall in any of the excepted categories, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 2505 would be attracted, it would have to be read subject to the provisions of the Act. Accordingly the termination of service in this case would constitute retrenchment and for not complying with pre- conditions to valid retrenchment, the order of termination would be illegal and invalid.”
11. What has been held by this Court in L. Robert D’Souza1 is that Section 25-F of the ID Act is applicable to a daily-rated worker. We do not think that there is any dispute on this proposition.

12. In Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Bangalore v. S. Mani and Others[14], this Court in paragraph 54 (pg. 120) of the Report held as under:

“54. Mr. Phadke, as noticed hereinbefore, has referred to a large number of decisions for demonstrating that this Court had directed reinstatement even if the workmen concerned were daily- wagers or were employed intermittently. No proposition of law was laid down in the aforementioned judgments. The said judgments of this Court, moreover, do not lay down any principle having universal application so that the Tribunals, or for that matter the High Court, or this Court, may feel compelled to direct reinstatement with continuity of service and back wages. The Tribunal has some discretion in this matter. Grant of relief must depend on the fact situation obtaining in a particular case. The industrial adjudicator cannot be held to be bound to grant some relief only because it will be lawful to do so.”
13. In Nagar Mahapalika (Now Municipal Corpn.) v. State of U.P. and Others[15], this Court, while dealing with the non-compliance with the provisions of Section 6-N (which is pari materia to Section 25-F) of U.P. Industrial Disputes Act held that the grant of relief of reinstatement with full back wages and continuity of service in favour of retrenched workmen would not automatically follow or as a matter of course. Instead, this Court modified the award of reinstatement with compensation of Rs. 30,000/- per workman.

14. In Municipal Council, Sujanpur v. Surinder Kumar[16], this Court after having accepted the finding that there was violation of Section 25-F of the ID Act, set aside the award of reinstatement with back wages and directed the workman to be paid monetary compensation in the sum of Rs. 50,000/-.

15. In Mamni4 , this Court modified the award of reinstatement passed by the Labour Court, though the termination of the workman was in violation of Section 25-F of the ID Act, by directing that the workman should be compensated by payment of a sum of Rs. 25,000/-.

16. In Regional Manager, SBI v. Mahatma Mishra[17], this Court observed that it was one thing to say that services of a workman were terminated in violation of mandatory provisions of law but it was another thing to say that relief of reinstatement in service with full back wages would be granted automatically.

17. In Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Om Pal[18], this Court in paragraphs 7 and 8 (pg. 745) of the Report held as under :

“7. Moreover, it is also now well settled that despite a wide discretionary power conferred upon the Industrial Courts under Section 11-A of the 1947 Act, the relief of reinstatement with full back wages should not be granted automatically only because it would be lawful to do so. Grant of relief would depend on the fact situation obtaining in each case. It will depend upon several factors, one of which would be as to whether the recruitment was effected in terms of the statutory provisions operating in the field, if any.
8. The respondent worked for a very short period. He only worked, as noticed hereinbefore, in 1994-95. The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, therefore, in our opinion committed an illegality, while passing an award in the year 2003, directing the reinstatement of the respondent with full back wages. Although we are of the opinion that the respondent was not entitled to any relief, whatsoever, we direct the appellant to pay him a sum of Rs. 25,000.”
18. In Uttaranchal Forest Development Corporation v. M.C.Joshi[19], the Court was concerned with a daily wager who had worked with Uttaranchal Forest Development Corporation from 01.08.1989 to 24.11.1991 and whose services were held to be terminated in violation of Section 6-N of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act. The Labour Court had directed the reinstatement of the workman with 50 per cent back wages from the date the industrial dispute was raised. Setting aside the order of reinstatement and back wages, this Court awarded compensation in a sum of Rs. 75,000/- in favour of the workman keeping in view the nature and period of service rendered by the workman and the fact that industrial dispute was raised after six years.

19. In Madhya Pradesh Administration v. Tribhuban [20] , this Court upheld the order of the Industrial Court passed in its jurisdiction under Section 11A of the ID Act awarding compensation and set aside the judgment of the Single Judge and the Division Bench that ordered the reinstatement of the workman with full back wages. The Court in paragraph 12 (pg. 755) of the Report held as under:

“12. In this case, the Industrial Court exercised its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 11-A of the Industrial Disputes Act. It merely directed the amount of compensation to which the respondent was entitled had the provisions of Section 25-F been complied with should be sufficient to meet the ends of justice. We are not suggesting that the High Court could not interfere with the said order, but the discretionary jurisdiction exercised by the Industrial Court, in our opinion, should have been taken into consideration for determination of the question as to what relief should be granted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. Each case is required to be dealt with in the fact situation obtaining therein.”
20. In Mahboob Deepak5 , this Court stated that an order of retrenchment passed in violation of Section 6-N of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act may be set aside but an order of reinstatement should not however be automatically passed. The Court observed in paragraphs 11 and 12 (pg. 578) of the Report as follows:-

“11. The High Court, on the other hand, did not consider the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of Section 6-N of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The appellant was entitled to compensation, notice and notice pay.
12. It is now well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that in a situation of this nature instead and in place of directing reinstatement with full back wages, the workmen should be granted adequate monetary compensation. (See M.P. Admn. v. Tribhuban20).”
21. In Telecom District Manager and others v. Keshab Deb[21], this Court said that even if the provisions of Section 25-F of the I.D. Act had not been complied with, the workman was only entitled to just compensation.

22. In Talwara Co-operative Credit and Service Society Limited v. Sushil Kumar[22], this Court in paragraph 8 (pg. 489) of the Report held as under :

“8. Grant of a relief of reinstatement, it is trite, is not automatic. Grant of back wages is also not automatic. The Industrial Courts while exercising their power under Section 11- A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are required to strike a balance in a situation of this nature. For the said purpose, certain relevant factors, as for example, nature of service, the mode and manner of recruitment viz. whether the appointment had been made in accordance with the statutory rules so far as a public sector undertaking is concerned, etc., should be taken into consideration.”
23. In Jagbir Singh6 , this Court, speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) while dealing with the question of consequential relief arising from the facts quite similar to the present case, ordered compensation of Rs. 50,000/- to be paid by the employer to the workman instead of reinstatement. In paragraph 14 (pg.335) of the Report, this Court held as under :

“14. It would be, thus, seen that by a catena of decisions in recent time, this Court has clearly laid down that an order of retrenchment passed in violation of Section 25-F although may be set aside but an award of reinstatement should not, however, be automatically passed. The award of reinstatement with full back wages in a case where the workman has completed 240 days of work in a year preceding the date of termination, particularly, daily wagers has not been found to be proper by this Court and instead compensation has been awarded. This Court has distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a post and a permanent employee.”
24. In Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board v. Laxmi Kant Gupta[23], this Court stated, “…. now there is no such principle that for an illegal termination of service the normal rule is reinstatement with back wages, and instead the Labour Court can award compensation”.

25. In Santosh Kumar Seal7, while dealing with a case of workmen who were engaged as daily wagers about 25 years back and had hardly worked for two or three years, this Court speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) held that reinstatement with back wages could not be said to be justified and instead monetary compensation would subserve the ends of justice. It was held that compensation of Rs. 40,000/- to each of the workmen would meet the ends of justice.

26. From the long line of cases indicated above, it can be said without any fear of contradiction that this Court has not held as an absolute proposition that in cases of wrongful dismissal, the dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement in all situations. It has always been the view of this Court that there could be circumstance(s) in a case which may make it inexpedient to order reinstatement. Therefore, the normal rule that dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement in cases of wrongful dismissal has been held to be not without exception. Insofar as wrongful termination of daily-rated workers is concerned, this Court has laid down that consequential relief would depend on host of factors, namely, manner and method of appointment, nature of employment and length of service. Where the length of engagement as daily wager has not been long, award of reinstatement should not follow and rather compensation should be directed to be paid. A distinction has been drawn between a daily wager and an employee holding the regular post for the purposes of consequential relief.

27. We shall now consider two decisions of this Court in Harjinder Singh2 and Devinder Singh3 upon which heavy reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the respondent. In Harjinder Singh2 , this Court did interfere with the order of the High Court which awarded compensation to the workman by modifying the award of reinstatement passed by the Labour Court. However, on close scrutiny of facts it transpires that that was a case where a workman was initially employed by Punjab State Warehousing Corporation as work-charge motor mate but after few months he was appointed as work munshi in the regular pay-scale for three months. His service was extended from time to time and later on by one month’s notice given by the Managing Director of the Corporation his service was brought to end on 05.07.1988. The workman challenged the implementation of the notice in a writ petition and by an interim order the High Court stayed the implementation of that notice but later on the writ petition was withdrawn with liberty to the workman to avail his remedy under the ID Act. After two months, the Managing Director of the Corporation issued notice dated 26.11.1992 for retrenchment of the workman along with few others by giving them one month’s pay and allowances in lieu of notice as per the requirement of Section 25-F(a) of the ID Act. On industrial dispute being raised, the Labour Court found that there was compliance of Section 25-F but it was found that the termination was violative of Section 25-G of the ID Act and, accordingly, Labour Court passed an award for reinstatement of the workman with 50 per cent back wages. The Single Judge of that High Court did not approve the award of reinstatement on the premise that the initial appointment of the workman was not in consonance with the statutory regulations and Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and accordingly, substituted the award of reinstatement with 50 per cent back wages by directing that the workman shall be paid a sum of Rs. 87,582/- by way of compensation. It is this order of the Single Judge that was set aside by this Court and order of the Labour Court restored. We are afraid the facts in Harjinder Singh2 are quite distinct. That was not a case of a daily- rated worker. It was held that Single Judge was wrong in entertaining an unfounded plea that workman was employed in violation of Articles 14 and

16. Harjinder Singh2 turned on its own facts and is not applicable to the facts of the present case at all.

28. In Devinder Singh3 , the workman was engaged by Municipal Council, Sanaur on 01.08.1994 for doing the work of clerical nature. He continued in service till 29.09.1996. His service was discontinued with effect from 30.09.1996 in violation of Section 25-F of ID Act. On industrial dispute being referred for adjudication, the Labour Court held that the workman had worked for more than 240 days in a calendar year preceding the termination of his service and his service was terminated without complying with the provisions of Section 25-F. Accordingly, Labour Court passed an award for reinstatement of the workman but without back wages. Upon challenge being laid to the award of the Labour Court, the Division Bench set aside the order of the Labour Court by holding that Labour Court should not have ordered reinstatement of the workman because his appointment was contrary to the Recruitment Rules and Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. In the appeal before this Court from the order of the Division Bench, this Court held that the High Court had neither found any jurisdictional infirmity in the award of the Labour Court nor it came to the conclusion that the award was vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record and notwithstanding these the High Court set aside the direction given by the Labour Court for reinstatement of the workman by assuming that his initial appointment was contrary to law. The approach of the High Court was found to be erroneous by this Court. This Court, accordingly, set aside the order of the High Court and restored the award of the Labour Court. In Devinder Singh3 , the Court had not dealt with the question about the consequential relief to be granted to the workman whose termination was held to be illegal being in violation of Section 25-F.

29. In our view, Harjinder Singh2 and Devinder Singh3 do not lay down the proposition that in all cases of wrongful termination, reinstatement must follow. This Court found in those cases that judicial discretion exercised by the Labour Court was disturbed by the High Court on wrong assumption that the initial employment of the employee was illegal. As noted above, with regard to the wrongful termination of a daily wager, who had worked for a short period, this Court in long line of cases has held that the award of reinstatement cannot be said to be proper relief and rather award of compensation in such cases would be in consonance with the demand of justice. Before exercising its judicial discretion, the Labour Court has to keep in view all relevant factors, including the mode and manner of appointment, nature of employment, length of service, the ground on which the termination has been set aside and the delay in raising the industrial dispute before grant of relief in an industrial dispute. 30. We may also refer to a recent decision of this Court in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v. Man Singh[24]. That was a case where the workmen, who were daily wagers during the year 1984-85, were terminated without following Section 25-F. The industrial dispute was raised after five years and although the Labour Court had awarded reinstatement of the workmen which was not interfered by the High Court, this Court set aside the award of reinstatement and ordered payment of compensation. In paragraphs 4 and 5 (pg.559) of the Report this Court held as under:

“4. This Court in a catena of decisions has clearly laid down that although an order of retrenchment passed in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act may be set aside but an award of reinstatement should not be passed. This Court has distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a post and a permanent employee.
5. In view of the aforementioned legal position and the fact that the respondent workmen were engaged as “daily wagers” and they had merely worked for more than 240 days, in our considered view, relief of reinstatement cannot be said to be justified and instead, monetary compensation would meet the ends of justice.”
31. In light of the above legal position and having regard to the facts of the present case, namely, the workman was engaged as daily wager on 01.03.1991 and he worked hardly for eight months from 01.03.1991 to 31.10.1991, in our view, the Labour Court failed to exercise its judicial discretion appropriately. The judicial discretion exercised by the Labour Court suffers from serious infirmity. The Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court also erred in not considering the above aspect at all. The award dated 28.06.2001 directing reinstatement of the respondent with continuity of service and 25% back wages in the facts and circumstances of the case cannot be sustained and has to be set aside and is set aside. In our view, compensation of Rs. 50,000/- by the appellant to the respondent shall meet the ends of justice. We order accordingly. Such payment shall be made to the respondent within six weeks from today failing which the same will carry interest @ 9 per cent per annum.

32. The appeal is partly allowed to the above extent with no order as to costs.",1
Arun Bhandari ,"2. Calling in question the legal pregnability of the order dated 29.1.2011 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 69 of 2011 whereby the learned single Judge in exercise of jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution has quashed the order dated 5.6.2010 passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, taking cognizance under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code (for short “the IPC”) against the respondent No. 2 in exercise of power under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short “the CrPC”) and the order dated 4.12.2010 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Gautam Budh Nagar affirming the said order, on the foundation that the allegations made neither in the FIR nor in the protest petition constitute offences under the aforesaid sections, the present appeal by special leave has been preferred.

3. The factual score as depicted are that the appellant is a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) living in Germany and while looking for a property in Greater Noida, he came in contact with respondent No. 2 and her husband, Raghuvinder Singh, who claimed to be the owner of the property in question and offered to sell the same. On 24.3.2008, as alleged, both the husband and wife agreed to sell the residential plot bearing No. 131, Block – (Cassia-Fastula Estate), Sector CHI-4, Greater Noida, U.P. for a consideration of Rs.2,43,97,880/- and an agreement to that effect was executed by the respondent No. 3, both the husband and wife jointly received a sum of Rs.1,05,00,000/- from the appellant towards part payment of the sale consideration. It was further agreed that the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 would obtain permission from Greater Noida Authority to transfer the property in his favour and execute the deed of transfer within 45 days from the grant of such permission.

4. As the factual antecedents would further reveal, the said agreement was executed on the basis of a registered agreement executed in favour of the respondent No. 3 by the original allottee, Smt. Vandana Bhardwaj to sell the said plot. After expiry of a month or so, the appellant enquired from the respondent No. 3 about the progress of delivery of possession from the original allottee, but he received conflicting and contradictory replies which created doubt in his mind and impelled him to rush to Noida and find out the real facts from the Greater Noida Authority. On due enquiry, he came to know that there was a registered agreement in favour of the 3rd respondent by Smt. Vandana Bhardwaj; that a power of attorney had been executed by the original allottee in favour of the respondent No. 2, the wife of respondent No. 3; that the original allottee, to avoid any kind of litigation, had also executed a will in favour of the respondent No. 3; and that the respondent No. 2 by virtue of the power of attorney, executed in her favour by the original allottee, had transferred the said property in favour of one Monika Goel who had got her name mutated in the record of Greater Noida Authority. Coming to know about the aforesaid factual score, he demanded refund of the money from the respondents, but a total indifferent attitude was exhibited, which compelled him to lodge an FIR at the Police Station, Kasna, which gave rise to the Criminal Case No. 563 of 2009.

5. The Investigating Officer, after completing the investigation, submitted the final report stating that the case was of a civil nature and no criminal offence had been made out. The appellant filed a protest petition before the learned Magistrate stating, inter alia, that the accused persons had colluded with the Investigating Officer and the Station House Officer as a result of which the Investigation Officer, on 22.10.2009, had concluded the investigation observing that the dispute was of the civil nature and intended to submit the final report before the court. The appellant coming to know about the same submitted an application before the concerned Area Officer, who, taking note of the same, handed over the investigation to another S.S.I. of Police on 24.11.2009. The said Investigating Officer recorded statements of the concerned Sub-Registrar, the Chief Executive Officer of Greater Noida Authority, from whose statements it was evident that the accused persons were never the owners of the property in question and the original allottee had not appeared in the Greater Noida Authority and not transferred any documents. He also recorded the statement of original allottee who had stated that the property was allotted in her name in 2005 and on a proposal being made by Raghuvinder Singh, a friend of her husband, to sell the property she executed an agreement to sell in his favour and a General Power of Attorney in the name of his wife, Savita Singh, at his instance but possession was not handed over to them. He also examined one Sharad Kumar Sharma, who was a witness to the agreement to sell and the Power of Attorney executed by the original allottee, and said Sharma had stated that the General Power of Attorney was executed to implement the agreement to sell executed in favour of Raghuvinder Singh. The Investigating Officer obtained an affidavit from the complainant which was kept in the case diary, and on 25.2.2010 it was recorded in the case diary that a criminal offence had been made out against the accused persons. The case diary also evinced that there was an effort for settlement between the informant and the accused persons and the accused persons were ready to return the amount of Rs.1,05,00,000/- to the appellant. On 10.3.2010, he made an entry to file the charge- sheet against the respondents under Sections 420, 406, 567, 468 and 479 of the IPC. At this stage, the accused persons again colluded with the previous Investigating Officer and the Station House Officer and got the investigation transferred to the previous Investigating Officer. Coming to know about the said development, the appellant submitted a petition before the Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar on 6.5.2010, but before any steps could be taken by the higher authority, the said Investigating Officer submitted a final report stating that no offence under the IPC had been made out. In the protest petition it was urged that the whole case diary should be perused and appropriate orders may be passed.

6. On the basis of the aforesaid protest petition the Chief Judicial Magistrate, on 5.6.2010, perused the final report submitted by the Investigating Officer, the entire case diary, the protest petition and the statements recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC by the previous Investigating Officer and came to hold that even if a suit could be filed, the fact situation prima facie revealed criminal culpability and, accordingly, took cognizance under Sections 420 and 406 of the IPC against the respondents and issued summons requiring them to appear before the court on 9.7.2010.

7. Being dissatisfied with the said order, the respondents preferred Criminal Revision No. 108 of 2010 before the learned Sessions Judge contending, inter alia, that the FIR had been lodged with an ulterior motive to pressurize the respondents to return the earnest money and the complainant had, in fact, committed breach of the terms of the agreement; that the allegations made in the FIR could only be ascertained on the basis of evidence and documents by a civil court of competent jurisdiction regard being had to the nature of the dispute; that the learned Magistrate had taken cognizance without any material in the case diary; and that the exercise of power under Section 190(1)(b) of the CrPC was totally unwarranted in the case at hand. The revisional court scanned the material brought on record, perused the case diary in entirety, took note of the conduct of the Investigating Officer who had submitted the final report stating that the allegations did not constitute any criminal offence despite the material brought on record during the course of investigation by the Investigating Officer, who was appointed at the instance of the Area Officer, scrutinized the substance of material collected to the effect that Raghuvinder Singh had no right, title and interest in the property and a General Power of Attorney was executed in favour of his wife to sell, transfer and convey all rights, title and interest in the plot in question on behalf of the original allottee and that the husband and wife had concealed the material factum of execution of Power of Attorney from the complainant and opined that both the accused persons had fraudulent and dishonest intention since the beginning of the negotiation with the complainant and, therefore, the allegations prima facie constituted a criminal offence and it could not be said that it was a pure and simple dispute of civil nature. Being of this view he gave the stamp of approval to the order passed by the learned Magistrate.

8. The unsuccess in revision compelled the respondents to approach the High Court in a writ petition and the Writ Court came to hold that on the basis of the allegations made in the FIR and the evidence collected during investigation it could not be said that the instant case is simpliciter a breach of contract not attracting any criminal liability as far as the husband was concerned and there was a prima facie case triable for offences under Section 406 and 420 of the IPC. However, while dealing with the allegations made against the wife, the High Court observed that there being no entrustment of any property by the complainant to her and further there being no privity of contract between them, she was under no legal obligation to disclose to the complainant that she held a registered Power of Attorney from the original allottee to sell and alienate the property in question and such non-disclosure of facts could not be said to have constituted offence either under Section 406 or Section 420 of the IPC. Being of this view the High Court partly allowed the writ petition and quashed the order taking cognizance and summoning of the wife, the respondent No. 2 herein.

9. We have heard Mr. Amit Khemka, learned counsel for the appellant, and Mr. Chetan Sharma, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent Nos. 2 and 3.

10. It is submitted by Mr. Khemka learned counsel for the appellant that the High Court could not have scrutinized the material brought on record as if it was sitting in appeal against the judgment of conviction and also committed error in ignoring certain material facts which make the order sensitively susceptible. It is his further submission that the learned Sessions Judge had considered the entire gamut of facts and appositely opined that the order taking cognizance could not be flawed but the High Court by taking note of the fact that there was no privity of contract and the non-disclosure was not material has completely erred in its conclusion and, hence, the order deserves to be lancinated.

11. Mr. Chetan Sharma, learned senior counsel, resisting the aforesaid contentions, canvassed that mere presence of the respondent No. 2 at the time of signing of the agreement to sell does not amount to an offence under Section 420 of the IPC as she did not sign the document nor did she endorse the same as a witness. It is urged by him that no criminal liability can be fastened on her, for the sine qua non for attracting criminality is to show dishonest intention right from the very inception which is non-existent in the case at hand. It is submitted by him that if the criminal action is allowed to continue against her that would put a premium on a commercial strategy adopted by the appellant in roping a lady only to have more bargaining power in the matter to arrive at a settlement despite the breach of contract by him. The learned senior counsel would further contend that the appellant has taken contradictory stands inasmuch as in one way he had demanded the forfeited amount and the other way lodged an FIR to set the criminal law in motion which is impermissible. To bolster the said contentions reliance has been placed on the judgments rendered in Hridya Rajan Pd. Verma & others v. State of Bihar and another[1], Murari Lal Gupta v. Gopi Singh[2] and B. Suresh Yadav v. Sharifa Bee and another[3].

12. At the very outset, it is necessary to state that on a perusal of the FIR, the protest petition and the order passed by the learned Magistrate, it is demonstrable that at various stages of the investigation different views were expressed by the Investigating Officers and the learned Magistrate has scrutinized the same and taking note of the allegations had exercised the power to reject the final report and take cognizance. The court taking cognizance and the revisional court have expressed the view that both the respondents had nurtured dishonest intentions from the very beginning of making the negotiation with the complainant and treated non-disclosure of execution of Power of Attorney in favour of the respondent No. 2 herein by the original owner as a material omission as a consequence of which damage had been caused to the complainant. The learned counsel for the appellant would submit that the High Court has misguided itself by observing that there was no entrustment of any property to the wife and further there was no privity of contract and non-disclosure on her part do not constitute an offence. The learned senior counsel for the respondent has highlighted the factum of absence of privity of contract. Regard being had to the allegations brought on record, the question that emerges for consideration is whether the High Court is justified in exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction to quash the order taking cognizance against the respondent No. 2 herein.

13. At this juncture, we may note that Raghuvinder Singh, respondent No. 3, had filed SLP (Crl) No. 3894 of 2011 which has been dismissed on 13.5.2011.

14. As advised at present we are inclined to discuss the decisions which have been commended to us by the learned senior counsel for the respondent. In Hridya Rajan Pd. Verma (supra) a complaint was filed that the accused persons therein had deliberately and intentionally diverted and induced the respondent society and the complainant by suppressing certain facts and giving false and concocted information and assurances to the complainant so as to make him believe that the deal was a fair one and free from troubles. The further allegation was that the accused person did so with the intention to acquire wrongful gain for themselves and to cause wrongful loss to the Society and the complainant and they had induced the complainant to enter into negotiation and get advance consideration money to them. The two- Judge Bench referred to the judgment in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal[4] wherein this Court has enumerated certain categories of cases by way of illustration wherein the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the CrPC could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of the court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The Bench also referred to the decisions in Rupen Deol Bajaj (Mrs.) v. Kanwar Pal Singh Gill[5], Rajesh Bajaj v. State NCT of Delhi[6] and State of Kerala v. O.C. Kuttan[7] wherein the principle laid down in Bhajan Lal (supra) was reiterated. The Court posed the question whether the case of the appellants therein came under any of the categories enumerated in Bhajan Lal (supra) and whether the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint if accepted in entirety did make out a case against the accused-appellants therein. For the aforesaid purpose advertence was made to offences alleged against the appellants, the ingredients of the offences and the averments made in the complaint. The Court took the view that main offence alleged to have been committed by the appellants is cheating punishable under Section 420 of the IPC. Scanning the definition of ‘cheating’ the Court opined that there are two separate classes of acts which the persons deceived may be induced to do. In the first place he may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to any person. The second class of acts set-forth in the section is the doing or omitting to do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived. In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest. In the second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional but not fraudulent or dishonest. Thereafter, the Bench proceeded to state as follows: -

“16. In determining the question it has to be kept in mind that the distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his subsequent conduct but for this subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, that is the time when the offence is said to have been committed. Therefore, it is the intention which is the gist of the offence. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made the promise cannot be presumed.”
15. After laying down the principle the Bench referred to the complaint and opined that reading the averments in the complaint in entirety and accepting the allegations to be true, the ingredients of intentional deception on the part of the accused right at the beginning of the negotiations for the transaction had neither been expressly stated nor indirectly suggested in the complaint. All that the respondent No. 2 had alleged against the appellants was that they did not disclose to him that one of their brothers had filed a partition suit which was pending. The requirement that the information was not disclosed by the appellants intentionally in order to make the respondent No. 2 part with property was not alleged expressly or even impliedly in the complaint. Therefore, the core postulate of dishonest intention in order to deceive the complainant-respondent No. 2 was not made out even accepting all the averments in the complaint on their face value and, accordingly, ruled that in such a situation continuing the criminal proceeding against the accused would be an abuse of process of the Court.

16. From the aforesaid decision it is quite clear that this Court recorded a finding that there was no averment in the complaint that intention to deceive on the part of the accused was absent right from the beginning of the negotiation of the transaction as the said allegation had neither been expressly made nor indirectly suggested in the complaint. This Court took note of the fact that only non-disclosure was that one of their brothers had filed a partition suit which was pending and the allegation that such a disclosure was not made intentionally to deceive the complainant was absent. It is worthy to note that this Court referred to certain averments in the complaint petition and scrutinized the allegations and recorded the aforesaid finding. The present case, as we perceive, stands on a different factual matrix altogether. The learned Sessions Judge has returned a finding that there was intention to deceive from the very beginning, namely, at the time of negotiation but the High Court has dislodged the same on the foundation that the respondent No. 2 was merely present and there was no privity of contract between the complainant and her. We will advert to the said factual analysis at a later stage after discussing the other authorities which have been placed reliance upon by the learned senior counsel for the respondents.

17. In Murari Lal Gupta (supra) a two-Judge Bench quashed the criminal complaint instituted under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC on the following analysis: -

“The complaint does not make any averment so as to infer any fraudulent or dishonest inducement having been made by the petitioner pursuant to which the respondent parted with the money. It is not the case of the respondent that the petitioner does not have the property or that the petitioner was not competent to enter into an agreement to sell or could not have transferred title in the property to the respondent. Merely because an agreement to sell was entered into which agreement the petitioner failed to honour, it cannot be said that the petitioner has cheated the respondent. No case for prosecution under Section 420 or Section 406 IPC is made out even prima facie. The complaint filed by the respondent and that too at Madhepura against the petitioner, who is a resident of Delhi, seems to be an attempt to pressurize the petitioner for coming to terms with the respondent.” In our considered opinion the factual position in the aforesaid case is demonstrably different and, hence, we have no hesitation in stating that the said decision is not applicable to the case at hand.
18. In B. Suresh Yadav (supra) the complainant, who was defendant in the suit, had filed a written statement from which it was manifest that she at all material times was aware of the purported demolition of the rooms standing on the suit property. It was contended in the written statement that the suit properties were different from the subject- matter of the deed of sale. After filing the written statement the respondent had filed the complaint under Section 420 of the IPC. The Court took note of the fact that there existed a dispute as to whether the property whereupon the said two rooms were allegedly situated was the same property forming the subject-matter of the deed of sale or not and a civil suit had already been filed pertaining to the said dispute. The Court also took note of the fact that at the time of execution of the sale deed the accused had not made any false or misleading representation and there was no omission on his part to do anything which he could have done. Under these circumstances, the Court opined that the dispute between the parties was basically a civil dispute. It is apt to note here that the Court also opined that when a stand had been taken in a complaint petition which is contrary to or inconsistent with the stand taken by him in a civil suit, the same assumes significance and had there been an allegation that the accused got the said two rooms demolished and concealed the said fact at the time of execution of the deed of sale, the matter would have been different. Being of this view, this Court quashed the criminal proceeding as that did amount to abuse of the process of the court. On an x-ray of the factual score, it can safely be stated that the said pronouncement renders no assistance to the lis in question.

19. Before we proceed to scan and analyse the material brought on record in the case at hand, it is seemly to refer to certain authorities wherein the ingredients of cheating have been highlighted. In State of Kerala v. A. Pareed Pillai and another[8], a two-Judge Bench ruled that to hold a person guilty of the offence of cheating, it has to be shown that his intention was dishonest at the time of making the promise and such a dishonest intention cannot be inferred from a mere fact that he could not subsequently fulfil the promise.

20. In G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad and others[9], this Court has held thus:

-
“7. As mentioned above, Section 415 has two parts. While in the first part, the person must “dishonestly” or “fraudulently” induce the complainant to deliver any property; in the second part, the person should intentionally induce the complainant to do or omit to do a thing. That is to say, in the first part, inducement must be dishonest or fraudulent. In the second part, the inducement should be intentional. As observed by this Court in Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. State of Bombay[10] a guilty intention is an essential ingredient of the offence of cheating. In order, therefore, to secure conviction of a person for the offence of cheating, “mens rea” on the part of that person, must be established. It was also observed in Mahadeo Prasad v. State of W.B.[11] that in order to constitute the offence of cheating, the intention to deceive should be in existence at the time when the inducement was offered.”
21. In S.N. Palanitkar and others v. State of Bihar and another[12], it has been laid down that in order to constitute an offence of cheating, the intention to deceive should be in existence at the time when the inducement was made. It is necessary to show that a person had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise, to say that he committed an act of cheating. A mere failure to keep up promise subsequently cannot be presumed as an act leading to cheating.
22. In the said case while dealing with the ingredients of criminal breach of trust and cheating, the Bench observed thus: -

“9. The ingredients in order to constitute a criminal breach of trust are: (i) entrusting a person with property or with any dominion over property (ii) that person entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting that property to his own use; or (b) dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other person so to do in violation (i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, (ii) of any legal contract made, touching the discharge of such trust.
10. The ingredients of an offence of cheating are: (i) there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him, (ii)(a) the person so deceived should be induced to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property; or (b) the person so deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and
(iii) in cases covered by (ii)(b), the act of omission should be one which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to the person induced in body, mind, reputation or property.”
23. Coming to the facts of the present case, it is luminicent from the FIR that the allegations against the respondent No. 2 do not only pertain to her presence but also about her total silence and connivance with her husband and transfer of property using Power of Attorney in favour of Monika Goel. It is also graphically clear that the complainant had made allegations that Raghuvinder Singh and his wife, Savita Singh, had met him at the site, showed the registered agreement and the cash and cheque were given to them at that time. It is also mentioned in the FIR that on 28.7.2008, Savita Singh had received the possession of the said plot and on the same day it was transferred in the name of Monika Goel. It is also reflectible that on 28.2.2007, Raghuvinder Singh and Savita Singh had got prepared and registered two documents in the office of the Sub-Registrar consisting one agreement to sell in favour of Raghuvinder Singh and another General Power of Attorney in favour of the wife. The allegation of collusion by the husband and wife has clearly been stated. During the investigation, as has been stated earlier, many a fact emerged but the same were ignored and a final report was submitted. In the protest petition the complainant had asseverated everything in detail about what emerged during the course of investigation. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate after perusal of the case diary and the FIR has expressed the view that a case under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC had been made out against both the accused persons. The learned Sessions Judge, after referring to the ingredients and the role ascribed, concurred with the same. The High Court declined to accept the said analysis on the ground that it was mere presence and further there was no privity of contract between the complainant and the respondent No. 2.

24. At this stage, we may usefully note that some times a case may apparently look to be of civil nature or may involve a commercial transaction but such civil disputes or commercial disputes in certain circumstances may also contain ingredients of criminal offences and such disputes have to be entertained notwithstanding they are also civil disputes. In this context, we may reproduce a passage from Mohammed Ibrahim and others v. State of Bihar and another[13]: -

“8. This Court has time and again drawn attention to the growing tendency of the complainants attempting to give the cloak of a criminal offence to matters which are essentially and purely civil in nature, obviously either to apply pressure on the accused, or out of enmity towards the accused, or to subject the accused to harassment. Criminal courts should ensure that proceedings before it are not used for settling scores or to pressurize parties to settle civil disputes. But at the same time, it should be noted that several disputes of a civil nature may also contain the ingredients of criminal offences and if so, will have to be tried as criminal offences, even if they also amount to civil disputes. (See G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P.[14] and Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd.[15])”
25. In this context we may usefully refer to a paragraph from All Cargo Movers (I) Pvt. Ltd. V. Dhanesh Badarmal Jain & Anr.[16] “…..Where a civil suit is pending and the complaint petition has been filed one year after filing of the civil suit, we may for the purpose of finding out as to whether the said allegations are prima facie cannot notice the correspondence exchanged by the parties and other admitted documents. It is one thing to say that the Court at this juncture would not consider the defence of the accused but it is another thing to say that for exercising the inherent jurisdiction of this Court, it is impermissible also to look to the admitted documents. Criminal proceedings should not be encouraged, when it is found to be mala fide or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. Superior Courts while exercising this power should also strive to serve the ends of justice.”

26. In Rajesh Bajaj v. State NCT of Delhi and others[17], while dealing with a case where the High Court had quashed an F.I.R., this Court opined that the facts narrated in the complaint petition may reveal a commercial transaction or a money transaction, but that is hardly a reason for holding that the offence of cheating would elude from such a transaction. Proceeding further, the Bench observed thus: -

“11. The crux of the postulate is the intention of the person who induces the victim of his representation and not the nature of the transaction which would become decisive in discerning whether there was commission of offence or not. The complainant has stated in the body of the complaint that he was induced to believe that the respondent would honour payment on receipt of invoices, and that the complainant realised later that the intentions of the respondent were not clear. He also mentioned that the respondent after receiving the goods had sold them to others and still he did not pay the money. Such averments would prima facie make out a case for investigation by the authorities.”
27. We have referred to the aforesaid decisions in the field to highlight about the role of the Court while dealing with such issues. In our considered opinion the present case falls in the category which cannot be stated at this stage to be purely civil in nature on the basis of the admitted documents or the allegations made in the FIR or what has come out in the investigation or for that matter what has been stated in the protest petition. We are disposed to think that prima facie there is allegation that there was a guilty intention to induce the complainant to part with money. We may hasten to clarify that it is not a case where a promise initially made could not lived up to subsequently. It is not a case where it could be said that even if the allegations in entirety are accepted, no case is made out. Needless to emphasise, the High Court, while exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC, has to adopt a very cautious approach. In Central Bureau of Investigation v. Ravi Shankar Srivastava, IAS and another[18], the Court, after referring to Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary[19] and Raghubir Saran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar[20], has observed that the powers possessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the IPC are very wide and the very plentitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise. The court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles and such inherent powers should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. This Court has further stated that it is not proper for the High Court to analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all probabilities in order to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable and on such premises arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be quashed. It has been further pronounced that it would be erroneous to assess the material before it and conclude that the complaint could not be proceeded with. The Bench has opined that the meticulous analysis of the case is not necessary and the complaint has to be read as a whole and if it appears that on consideration of the allegations in the light of the statement made on oath of the complainant that the ingredients of the offence or offences are disclosed and there is no material to show that the complaint is mala fide, frivolous or vexatious, in that event there would be no justification for interference by the High Court.

28. In R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta and others[21], after referring to the decisions in Hamida v. Rashid[22] and State of Orissa v. Saroj Kumar Sahoo[23], this Court eventually culled out the following propositions:

-

“15. Propositions of law which emerge from the said decisions are:
a. The High Court ordinarily would not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to quash a criminal proceeding and, in particular, a first information report unless the allegations contained therein, even if given face value and taken to be correct in their entirety, disclosed no cognizable offence.
b. For the said purpose the Court, save and except in very exceptional circumstances, would not look to any document relied upon by the defence.
c. Such a power should be exercised very sparingly. If the allegations made in the FIR disclose commission of an offence, the Court shall not go beyond the same and pass an order in favour of the accused to hold absence of any mens rea or actus reus.
d. If the allegation discloses a civil dispute, the same by itself may not be a ground to hold that the criminal proceedings should not be allowed to continue.”
29. It is worth noting that it was observed therein that one of the paramount duties of the superior court is to see that person who is absolutely innocent is not subjected to prosecution and humiliation on the basis of a false and wholly untenable complaint.

30. Recently in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another[24] a three-Judge Bench has observed that: -

“55. In the very nature of its constitution, it is the judicial obligation of the High Court to undo a wrong in course of administration of justice or to prevent continuation of unnecessary judicial process. This is founded on the legal maxim quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, conceditur et id sine qua res ipsa esse non potest. The full import of which is whenever anything is authorised, and especially if, as a matter of duty, required to be done by law, it is found impossible to do that thing unless something else not authorised in express terms be also done, may also be done, then that something else will be supplied by necessary intendment. Ex debito justitiae is inbuilt in such exercise; the whole idea is to do real, complete and substantial justice for which it exists. The power possessed by the High Court under Section 482 of the Code is of wide amplitude but requires exercise with great caution and circumspection.”
31. Applying the aforesaid parameters we have no hesitation in coming to hold that neither the FIR nor the protest petition was mala fide, frivolous or vexatious. It is also not a case where there is no substance in the complaint. The manner in which the investigation was conducted by the officer who eventually filed the final report and the transfer of the investigation earlier to another officer who had almost completed the investigation and the entire case diary which has been adverted to in detail in the protest petition prima facie makes out a case against the husband and the wife regarding collusion and the intention to cheat from the very beginning, inducing him to hand over a huge sum of money to both of them. Their conduct of not stating so many aspects, namely, the Power of Attorney executed by the original owner, the will and also the sale effected by the wife in the name of Monika Singh on 28.7.2008 cannot be brushed aside at this stage. Therefore, we are disposed to think that the High Court, while exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction, had not proceeded on the sound principles of law for quashment of order taking cognizance. The High Court and has been guided by the non-existence of privity of contract and without appreciating the factual scenario has observed that the wife was merely present. Be it noted, if the wife had nothing to do with any of the transactions with the original owner and was not aware of the things, possibly the view of the High Court could have gained acceptation, but when the wife had the Power of Attorney in her favour and was aware of execution of the will, had accepted the money along with her husband from the complainant, it is extremely difficulty to say that an innocent person is dragged to face a vexatious litigation or humiliation. The entire conduct of the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 would show that a prima facie case is made out and allegations are there on record in this regard that they had the intention to cheat from the stage of negotiation. That being the position, the decision in Hridya Rajan Pd. Verma & others (supra) which is commended to us by Mr. Sharma, learned senior counsel, to which we have adverted to earlier, does not really assist the respondents and we say so after making the factual analysis in detail.

32. In view of our aforesaid analysis we allow the appeal, set aside the order passed by the High Court and direct the Magistrate to proceed in accordance with law. However, we may clarify that we may not be understood to have expressed any opinion on the merits of the case one way or the other and our observations must be construed as limited to the order taking cognizance and nothing more than that. The learned Magistrate shall decide the case on its own merit without being influenced by any of our observations as the same have been made only for the purpose of holding that the order of cognizance is prima facie valid and did not warrant interference by the High Court.",0
M/S. UNIWORTH TEXTILES LTD.,"1. This appeal under Section 130-E of the Customs Act, 1962 (for short “the Act”) arises from the final Order No. 142/03-B dated 18.02.2003, passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short “the Tribunal”). By the impugned order, the Tribunal has upheld the levy of customs duty on the import of furnace oil as also the penalty under Section 112 of the Act, rejecting the plea of the appellant that demand of the duty along with the penalty was barred by limitation.

2. The appellant, an Export Oriented Unit (for short “EOU”), is engaged in the manufacture of all wool and poly-wool worsted grey fabrics. It was granted the status of EOU by the Government of India, Ministry of Industry, Department of Industrial Development by way of a Letter of Permission (for short “the LOP”) dated 31.08.1992 as amended by letter dated 4.5.1993. The appellant applied for a license for private bonded warehouse, which was granted to it under C. No. V (Ch.51) 13- 01/92/100%EOU dated 30.09.1992 by the Assistant Collector, Central Excise Division- Raipur for storing inputs, raw materials, etc. either imported duty-free by availing concessions available for 100% EOU or procured locally without payment of duty for use in manufacture of all wool, poly-wool and other fabrics.

3. For interaction with the appellant, its sister unit, Uniworth Ltd., another EOU, engaged in the generation of power from a captive power plant, obtained another LOP dated 1.11.1994. The said LOP, dated 1.11.1994, permitted usage of electricity generated by the captive power plant by both, Uniworth Ltd. and the appellant Uniworth Textiles Ltd. The appellant purchased electricity from Uniworth Ltd. under an agreement which continued till 1999.

4. Prior to January-February, 2000, the sister unit i.e. Uniworth Ltd. procured furnace oil required for running the captive power plant. This purchase of furnace oil was exempted from payment of customs duty under Notification No. 53/97-Cus., the relevant portion of which reads as follows: -

“Notification No. 53/97-Cus., dated 3-6-1997 Exemption to specified goods imported for production of goods for export or for use in 100% Export-Oriented Undertakings -- New Scheme -- Notification No. 13/81-Cus. rescinded In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 25 of the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962), the Central Government being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby exempts goods specified in the Table below (hereinafter referred to as the goods), when imported into India, for the purpose of manufacture of articles for export out of India, or for being used in connection with the production or packaging or job work for export of goods or services out of India by hundred per cent Export Oriented units approved by the Board of Approvals for hundred per cent Export Oriented Units appointed by the notification of Government of India in the Ministry of Industry, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion for this purpose, (hereinafter referred to as the said Board), from the whole of duty of customs leviable thereon under the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975) and the additional duty, if any, leviable thereon under section 3 of the said Customs Tariff Act...” Entry 11 of the said notification at the relevant time read as follows:

-

“11. Captive power plants including captive generating sets and their spares for such plants and sets as recommended by the said Board of Approvals.”
5. In January-February, 2000, Uniworth Ltd. exhausted the limit of letter of credit opened by it for the duty-free import of furnace oil. It made an alternative arrangement of procuring duty free furnace oil under Notification No. 01/95 titled “Specified goods meant for manufacture and packaging of articles in 100% EOU or manufacture or development of electronic hardware and software in EHTP or STP” dated 04.01.1995. The said notification reads as follows :-

“Notification No. 1/95-Central Excise In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 5A of the Central Excises and Salt Act/ 1944 (1 of 1944), read with sub- section (3) of section 3 of the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 (58 of 1957), the Central Government being satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, hereby exempts excisable goods, specified in Annexure I to this notification (hereinafter referred to as the said goods), when brought in connection with -

a) the manufacture and packaging of articles, or for production or packaging or job work for export of goods or services out of India into hundred percent export oriented undertaking (hereinafter referred to as the user industry); or;

           XXX              XXX                    XXX


           from the whole of,


(i)    the duty of excise leviable thereon under section 3 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), and

(ii)    the additional duty of excise leviable thereon under sub- section (1) of section 3 of the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 (58 of 1957), XXX XXX XXX ANNEXURE I

3.    Captive power plants including captive generating sets and transformers as recommended by the Development Commissioner/Designated Officer.

3B.    Spares, fuel, lubricants, consumables and accessories for captive power plants including captive generating sets and spares, consumables and accessories for transformers as approved by the Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise.

3C.    Furnace oil required for the boilers as approved by the Assistant Commissioner of Customs or Central Excise on the recommendation of the Development Commissioner.”

6. Therefore, Uniworth Ltd. informed the appellant that it would require the arrangement for running the captive power plant for its own use, and hence, would be compelled to stop the supply of electricity to the appellant. Consequently, as a temporary measure, for overcoming this difficulty, the appellant, while availing the benefit of Notification No. 53/97-Cus, procured furnace oil from Coastal Wartsila Petroleum Ltd., a Foreign Trade Zone unit. It supplied the same to Uniworth Ltd. for generation of electricity, which it continued to receive as before.

7. Since the appellant was procuring furnace oil for captive power plant of another unit, it wrote to the Development Commissioner seeking clarification that whether duty on the supply and receipt of furnace oil and electricity respectively was required to be paid. The Development Commissioner, referring to a circular dated 12.10.1999 of the Ministry of Commerce, said as follows: -

“They are procuring surplus power from their sister concern M/s. Uniworth Ltd. (Unit- 1, LOP dated 31.01.1989) under Permission No. 248(93) dated 01.11.1994 and the unit transferred 2590.30 KL of furnace oil to M/s. Uniworth Ltd. (Unit- 1) for their captive power consumption. No permission is required from this office for duty free import/ procurement of POL products for captive power consumption. It is further to clarify as per the Exim Policy provision, one EOU may sell/ transfer surplus power to another EOU duty free in terms of Ministry of Commerce Letter No. 1/1/98-EP dated 12.10.1999 (sic)” [Emphasis supplied] The relevant portion of the Ministry of Commerce Letter No.1/98-EP is extracted below:

“2. No duty is required to paid (sic) on sale of surplus power from an EOU/EPZ unit to another EOU/EPZ unit. Development Commissioner of EPZ concerned would be informed in writing for such supply and proper account of consumption of raw material would be maintained by the supplying unit for calculation of NFEP.”
8. Yet, the appellant received a show cause notice from the Commissioner of Customs, Raipur, demanding duty for the period during which the appellant imported furnace oil on behalf of Uniworth Ltd. It gave the following reason for the same: -

“1.1. M/s. Uniworth Ltd. (Power Division), Raipur, is engaged in the generation of power. M/s. Uniworth Textiles Ltd. and M/s. Uniworth Ltd. both are distinct companies having different LOP Central Excise Registration No. and different board of directors. They are different companies as per Companies Act and they prepare separate balance sheet… 4.2. Therefore it appears that the noticees had not received 742.5 KL of furnace oil … from M/s. Coastal Wartsila Petroleum Ltd… in their factory at all as neither they had storing facility to store the furnace oil so procured nor they had any power plant to utilize the said furnace oil to generate electricity. They also did not have LOP from Government of India… to procure and use furnace oil to generate electricity as they did not have any power plant in their factory… Considering the above fact it is clear that the procurement of 742.5 KL of furnace oil under shipping bill, without payment of customs duty, is against the provisions of Customs Act, 1962 and rules made hereunder (sic).”

9. The show cause notice was issued on 02.08.2001, more than six months after the appellant had imported furnace oil on behalf of Uniworth Ltd. in January, 2001. This time period of more than six months is significant due to the proviso to Section 28 of the Act. The Section, at the relevant time, read as follows: -

“28. Notice for payment of duties, interest, etc. (1) When any duty has not been levied or has been short-levied or erroneously refunded, or when any interest payable has not been paid, part paid or erroneously refunded, the proper officer may,-

(a) in the case of any import made by any individual for his personal use or by Government or by any educational, research or charitable institution or hospital, within one year;

(b) in any other case, within six months, from the relevant date, serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty or interest which has not been levied or charged or which has been so short-levied or part paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made, requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice:

Provided that where any duty has not been levied or has been short- levied or the interest has not been charged or has been part paid or the duty or interest has been erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter or the agent or employee of the importer or exporter, the provisions of this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words “one year” and “six Months”, the words “five years” were substituted.

Explanation.-- Where the service of the notice is stayed by an order of a court, the period of such stay shall be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of one year or six months or five years, as the case may be.""

[Emphasis supplied]

10. The Section imposes a limitation period of six months within which the concerned authorities must commence action against an importer/assessee in case of duties not levied, short-levied or erroneously refunded. It allows the said limitation period to be read as five years only in some specific circumstances, viz. collusion, willful misstatement or suppression of facts. Since the said show-cause notice was issued after the elapse of six months, the revenue, for its action to be legal in the eyes of law, can only take refuge under the proviso to the section.

11. Both the appellate authorities, viz. the Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise (Appeals) and the Tribunal, rejected the claims of the appellant and affirmed payment of duty and penalty. They reasoned that since the appellant procured the furnace oil not for its own captive power plant, but for that of another, it could not claim exemption from payment of duty; entitlement of duty free import of fuel for its captive power plant lies with the owner of the captive power plant, and not the consumer of electricity generated from that power plant. Little or no attention was paid to the issue of limitation, which in our opinion, is the primary question for consideration in this case. The Tribunal only made the following observations in this regard:

“2. … He however, submitted that the demand of duty is barred by limitation as the show cause notice was issued on 02.08.2001 by demanding the duty for the period January/February 2001; that the Department was aware that the appellants do not have power plant and as such furnace oil could not have been used by them captively; that this is evident from letter dated 17.07.2001… 4… The appellants have also not brought on record any material in support of their contention that the Department was aware of the fact that the appellants did not have captive power plant. In view of this the demand cannot be held to be hit by the time limit.” Hence, the appellant is before us in this appeal.

12. We have heard both sides, Mr. R.P. Bhatt, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant, and Mr. Mukul Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue. We are not convinced by the reasoning of the Tribunal. The conclusion that mere non-payment of duties is equivalent to collusion or willful misstatement or suppression of facts is, in our opinion, untenable. If that were to be true, we fail to understand which form of non-payment would amount to ordinary default? Construing mere non-payment as any of the three categories contemplated by the proviso would leave no situation for which, a limitation period of six months may apply. In our opinion, the main body of the Section, in fact, contemplates ordinary default in payment of duties and leaves cases of collusion or willful misstatement or suppression of facts, a smaller, specific and more serious niche, to the proviso. Therefore, something more must be shown to construe the acts of the appellant as fit for the applicability of the proviso.

13. This Court, in Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company Vs. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay[1], while interpreting the proviso of an analogous provision in Section 11A of The Central Excise Act, 1944, which is pari materia to the proviso to Section 28 discussed above, made the following observations:

“4. Section 11A empowers the Department to re-open proceedings if the levy has been short-levied or not levied within six months from the relevant date. But the proviso carves out an exception and permits the authority to exercise this power within five years from the relevant date in the circumstances mentioned in the proviso, one of it being suppression of facts. The meaning of the word both in law and even otherwise is well known. In normal understanding it is not different that what is explained in various dictionaries unless of course the context in which it has been used indicates otherwise. A perusal of the proviso indicates that it has been used in company of such strong words as fraud, collusion or wilful default. In fact it is the mildest expression used in the proviso. Yet the surroundings in which it has been used it has to be construed strictly. It does not mean any omission. The act must be deliberate. In taxation, it can have only one meaning that the correct information was not disclosed deliberately to escape from payment of duty. Where facts are known to both the parties the omission by one to do what he might have done and not that he must have done, does not render it suppression.” [Emphasis supplied]

14. In Sarabhai M. Chemicals Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Vadodara[2], a three- judge bench of this Court, while referring to the observations extracted above, echoed the following views:

“23. Now coming to the question of limitation, at the outset, we wish to clarify that there are two concepts which are required to be kept in mind for the purposes of deciding this case. Reopening of approvals/assessments is different from raising of demand in relation to the extended period of limitation. Under section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944, a proper officer can reopen the approvals/assessments in cases of escapement of duty on account of non- levy, non-payment, short-levy, short- payment or erroneous refund, subject to it being done within one year from the relevant date. On the other hand, the demand for duty in relation to extended period is mentioned in the proviso to section 11A(1). Under that proviso, in cases where excise duty has not been levied or paid or has been short- levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded on account of fraud, collusion or wilful mis-statement or suppression of facts, or in contravention of any provision of the Act or Rules with the intent to evade payment of duty, demand can be made within five years from the relevant date. In the present case, we are concerned with the proviso to section 11A(1).

24. In the case of Cosmic Dye Chemical v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay (1995) 6 SCC 117, this Court held that intention to evade duty must be proved for invoking the proviso to section 11A(1) for extended period of limitation. It has been further held that intent to evade duty is built into the expression ""fraud and collusion"" but mis- statement and suppression is qualified by the preceding word ""wilful"". Therefore, it is not correct to say that there can be suppression or misstatement of fact, which is not wilful and yet constitutes a permissible ground for invoking the proviso to section 11A.

25. In case of Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company v. C.C.E. [1995 (78) ELT 401(SC)], this Court has held that the extended period of five years under the proviso to section 11A(1) is not applicable just for any omission on the part of the assessee, unless it is a deliberate attempt to escape from payment of duty. Where facts are known to both the parties, the omission by one to do what he might have done and not that he must have done does not constitute suppression of fact.”

15. In Anand Nishikawa Co. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Meerut[3], while again referring to the observations made in Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company (supra), this Court clarified the requirements of the proviso to Section 11- A, as follows:-

“26…This Court in the case of Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay (supra), while dealing with the meaning of the expression ""suppression of facts"" in proviso to Section 11A of the Act held that the term must be construed strictly, it does not mean any omission and the act must be deliberate and willful to evade payment of duty. The Court, further, held :-

‘In taxation, it (""suppression of facts"") can have only one meaning that the correct information was not disclosed deliberately to escape payment of duty. Where facts are known to both the parties the omission by one to do what he might have done and not that he must have done, does not render it suppression.’
27. Relying on the aforesaid observations of this Court in the case of Pushpam Pharmaceutical Co. v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay [1995 Suppl. (3) SCC 462], we find that ""suppression of facts"" can have only one meaning that the correct information was not disclosed deliberately to evade payment of duty. When facts were known to both the parties, the omission by one to do what he might have done and not that he must have done, would not render it suppression. It is settled law that mere failure to declare does not amount to willful suppression. There must be some positive act from the side of the assessee to find willful suppression. Therefore, in view of our findings made herein above that there was no deliberate intention on the part of the appellant not to disclose the correct information or to evade payment of duty, it was not open to the Central Excise Officer to proceed to recover duties in the manner indicated in the proviso to Section 11A of the Act.”

16. In Collector of Central Excise Vs. H.M.M. Ltd.[4], this Court held that mere non- disclosure of certain items assessable to duty does not tantamount to the mala fides elucidated in the proviso to Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act, 1944. It enunciated the principle in the following way: -

“The mere non-declaration of the waste/by-product in their classification list cannot establish any wilful withholding of vital information for the purpose of evasion of excise duty due on the said product. There could be, counsel contended, bonafide belief on the part of the assessee that the said waste or by-product did not attract excise duty and hence it may not have been included in their classification list. But that per se cannot go to prove that there was the intention to evade payment of duty or that the assessee was guilty of fraud, collusion, mis-conduct or suppression to attract the proviso to Section 11A(1) of the Act. There is considerable force in this contention.

Therefore, if non- disclosure of certain items assessable to duty does not invite the wrath of the proviso, we fail to understand how the non-payment of duty on disclosed items, after inquiry from the concerned department meets, with that fate.

17. In fact, the Act contemplates a positive action which betrays a negative intention of willful default. The same was held by Easland Combines, Coimbatore Vs. The Collector of Central Excise, Coimbatore[5] wherein this Court held:-

“31.It is settled law that for invoking the extended period of limitation duty should not have been paid, short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded because of either fraud, collusion, wilful misstatement, suppression of facts or contravention of any provision or rules. This Court has held that these ingredients postulate a positive act and, therefore, mere failure to pay duty and/or take out a licence which is not due to any fraud, collusion or willful misstatement or suppression of fact or contravention of any provision is not sufficient to attract the extended period of limitation.” [Emphasis supplied]

18. We are in complete agreement with the principle enunciated in the above decisions, in light of the proviso to Section 11A of the Central Excise Act, 1944. However, before extending it to the Act, we would like to point out the niceties that separate the analogous provisions of the two, an issue which received the indulgence of this Court in Associated Cement Companies Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Customs[6] in the following words:-

“53…Our attention was drawn to the cases of CCE v. Chemphar Drugs and Liniments (1989) 2 SCC 127, Cosmic Dye Chemical v. CCE (1995) 6 SCC 117, Padmini Products v. CCE (1989) 4 SCC 275, T.N. Housing Board v. CCE 1995 Supp (1) SCC 50 and CCE v. H. M. M. Ltd. (supra). In all these cases the Court was concerned with the applicability of the proviso to Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act which, like in the case of the Customs Act, contemplated the increase in the period of limitation for issuing a show-cause notice in the case of non-levy or short-levy to five years from a normal period of six months...

54. While interpreting the said provision in each of the aforesaid cases, it was observed by this Court that for proviso to Section 11-A to be invoked, the intention to evade payment of duty must be shown. This has been clearly brought out in Cosmic Dye Chemical case where the Tribunal had held that so far as fraud, suppression or misstatement of facts was concerned the question of intent was immaterial. While disagreeing with the aforesaid interpretation this Court at p. 119 observed as follows: (SCC para 6) ‘6. Now so far as fraud and collusion are concerned, it is evident that the requisite intent, i.e., intent to evade duty is built into these very words. So far as misstatement or suppression of facts are concerned, they are clearly qualified by the word ‘wilful’ preceding the words ‘misstatement or suppression of facts’ which means with intent to evade duty. The next set of words ‘contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or Rules’ are again qualified by the immediately following words ‘with intent to evade payment of duty’. It is, therefore, not correct to say that there can be a suppression or misstatement of fact, which is not wilful and yet constitutes a permissible ground for the purpose of the proviso to Section 11- A. Misstatement or suppression of fact must be wilful.’ The aforesaid observations show that the words “with intent to evade payment of duty” were of utmost relevance while construing the earlier expression regarding the misstatement or suppression of facts contained in the proviso. Reading the proviso as a whole the Court held that intent to evade duty was essentially before the proviso could be invoked.

55. Though it was sought to be contended that Section 28 of the Customs Act is in pari materia with Section 11-A of the Excise Act, we find there is one material difference in the language of the two provisions and that is the words “with intent to evade payment of duty” occurring in proviso to Section 11-A of the Excise Act which are missing in Section 28(1) of the Customs Act and the proviso in particular…

56. The proviso to Section 28 can inter alia be invoked when any duty has not been levied or has been short-levied by reason of collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter, his agent or employee. Even if both the expressions “misstatement” and “suppression of facts” are to be qualified by the word “wilful”, as was done in the Cosmic Dye Chemical case while construing the proviso to Section 11-A, the making of such a wilful misstatement or suppression of facts would attract the provisions of Section 28 of the Customs Act. In each of these appeals it will have to be seen as a fact whether there has been a non-levy or short-levy and whether that has been by reason of collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts by the importer or his agent or employee.” [Emphasis supplied]

19. Thus, Section 28 of the Act clearly contemplates two situations, viz. inadvertent non-payment and deliberate default. The former is canvassed in the main body of Section 28 of the Act and is met with a limitation period of six months, whereas the latter, finds abode in the proviso to the section and faces a limitation period of five years. For the operation of the proviso, the intention to deliberately default is a mandatory prerequisite.

20. This Court in Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Limited and Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Customs, Maharashtra[7] observed:-

“The proviso to Section 28(1)can be invoked where the payment of duty has escaped by reason of collusion or any willful misstatement or suppression of facts. So far as “misstatement or suppression of facts” are concerned, they are qualified by the word ""willful"". The word ""willful"" preceding the words ""misstatement or suppression of facts"" clearly spells out that there has to be an intention on the part of the assessee to evade the duty.”

21. The Revenue contended that of the three categories, the conduct of the appellant falls under the case of “willful misstatement” and pointed to the use of the word “misutilizing” in the following statement found in the order of the Commissioner of Customs, Raipur in furtherance of its claim:

“The noticee procured 742.51 kl of furnace oil valued at Rs. 54,57,357/- without payment of customs duty by misutilizing the facility available to them under Notification No. 53/97-Cus. dt. 3.6.1997”

22. We are not persuaded to agree that this observation by the Commissioner, unfounded on any material fact or evidence, points to a finding of collusion or suppression or misstatement. The use of the word “willful” introduces a mental element and hence, requires looking into the mind of the appellant by gauging its actions, which is an indication of one’s state of mind. Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition (pp 1599) defines “willful” in the following manner: -

“Willful. Proceeding from a conscious motion of the will; voluntary; knowingly; deliberate. Intending the result which actually comes to pass… An act or omission is “willfully” done, if done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done…”

23. In the present case, from the evidence adduced by the appellant, one will draw an inference of bona fide conduct in favour of the appellant. The appellant laboured under the very doubt which forms the basis of the issue before us and hence, decided to address it to the concerned authority, the Development Commissioner, thus, in a sense offering its activities to assessment. The Development Commissioner answered in favour of the appellant and in its reply, even quoted a letter by the Ministry of Commerce in favour of an exemption the appellant was seeking, which anybody would have found satisfactory. Only on receiving this satisfactory reply did the appellant decide to claim exemption. Even if one were to accept the argument that the Development Commissioner was perhaps not the most suitable repository of the answers to the queries that the appellant laboured under, it does not take away from the bona fide conduct of the appellant. It still reflects the fact that the appellant made efforts in pursuit of adherence to the law rather than its breach.

24. Further, we are not convinced with the finding of the Tribunal which placed the onus of providing evidence in support of bona fide conduct, by observing that “the appellants had not brought anything on record” to prove their claim of bona fide conduct, on the appellant. It is a cardinal postulate of law that the burden of proving any form of mala fide lies on the shoulders of the one alleging it. This Court observed in Union of India Vs. Ashok Kumar & Ors.[8] that “it cannot be overlooked that burden of establishing mala fides is very heavy on the person who alleges it. The allegations of mala fides are often more easily made than proved, and the very seriousness of such allegations demand proof of a high order of credibility.”

25. Moreover, this Court, through a catena of decisions, has held that the proviso to Section 28 of the Act finds application only when specific and explicit averments challenging the fides of the conduct of the assessee are made in the show cause notice, a requirement that the show cause notice in the present case fails to meet. In Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Limited and Ors. (supra), this Court made the following observations:

“21. This Court while interpreting Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act in Collector of Central Excise v. H.M.M. Ltd. (supra) has observed that in order to attract the proviso to Section 11-A(1) it must be shown that the excise duty escaped by reason of fraud, collusion or willful misstatement of suppression of fact with intent to evade the payment of duty. It has been observed:

‘...Therefore, in order to attract the proviso to Section 11- A(1) it must be alleged in the show-cause notice that the duty of excise had not been levied or paid by reason of fraud, collusion or willful misstatement or suppression of fact on the part of the assessee or by reason of contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or of the Rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duties by such person or his agent. There is no such averment to be found in the show cause notice. There is no averment that the duty of excise had been intentionally evaded or that fraud or collusion had been practiced or that the assessee was guilty of wilful misstatement or suppression of fact. In the absence of any such averments in the show-cause notice it is difficult to understand how the Revenue could sustain the notice under the proviso to Section 11-
A(1) of the Act.’ It was held that the show cause notice must put the assessee to notice which of the various omissions or commissions stated in the proviso is committed to extend the period from six months to five years. That unless the assessee is put to notice the assessee would have no opportunity to meet the case of the Department. It was held:

...There is considerable force in this contention. If the department proposes to invoke the proviso to Section 11-A(1) , the show-cause notice must put the assessee to notice which of the various commissions or omissions stated in the proviso is committed to extend the period from six months to 5 years. Unless the assessee is put to notice, the assessee would have no opportunity to meet the case of the department. The defaults enumerated in the proviso to the said sub-section are more than one and if the Excise Department places reliance on the proviso it must be specifically stated in the show-cause notice which is the allegation against the assessee falling within the four corners of the said proviso....” (Emphasis supplied)
26. Hence, on account of the fact that the burden of proof of proving mala fide conduct under the proviso to Section 28 of the Act lies with the Revenue; that in furtherance of the same, no specific averments find a mention in the show cause notice which is a mandatory requirement for commencement of action under the said proviso; and that nothing on record displays a willful default on the part of the appellant, we hold that the extended period of limitation under the said provision could not be invoked against the appellant.

27. In view of the afore-going discussion, the appeal is allowed and the decisions of the authorities below are set aside, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.",
Prashant Bharti,"1. Leave granted.

2. On 16.2.2007, Priya (hereinafter referred to as, the complainant/prosecuterix), aged 21 years, a resident of Tughlakabad Extension, New Delhi, made a phone call to the Police Control Room (hereinafter referred to as, the PCR). Police personnel immediately reached her residence. She made a statement to the police, leading to the registration of first information report no. 47 of 2007 at Police Station Lodhi Colony, New Delhi, under Sections 328 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code. In her statement to the police, the complainant/prosecuterix alleged, that the appellant herein Prashant Bharti (hereinafter referred to as, the appellant-accused) was known to her for about four months. The appellant-accused was a resident of Lodhi Colony, New Delhi. It was alleged that on the preceding day i.e., on 15.2.2007, the appellant-accused had made a phone call to the complainant/prosecuterix, at about 8.45 pm, and asked her to meet him at Lodhi Colony, New Delhi. When she - reached Lodhi Colony, he drove her around in his car. He also offered the complainant/prosecuterix a cold drink (Pepsi) allegedly containing a poisonous/intoxicating substance. According to the complainant/prosecuterix she felt inebriated after taking the cold drink. In her aforesaid state, the appellant-accused started misbehaving with her. He also touched her breasts. Inspite of the complainant/prosecuterix stopping him, it was alleged, that the appellant-accused continued to misbehave with her. The complainant/prosecuterix then got the car stopped, and hired an auto-rickshaw to return to her residence. In her statement, the complainant/prosecuterix requested the police to take legal action against the appellant-accused.

3. Immediately after recording the statement of Priya (the complainant/prosecuterix) on 16.2.2007, the police took her to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (hereinafter referred to as, the AIIMS), New Delhi. She was medically examined at 1.44 pm. It is sufficient to record herein, that as per the medical report prepared at the AIIMS, there was no evidence of poisoning.

4. Based on the statement made by the complainant/prosecuterix, the appellant-accused Prashant Bharti was arrested at 6 pm, on the same day on which the complainant recorded her statement, i.e., on 16.2.2007, a day after the occurrence.

5. After a lapse of five further days, on 21.2.2007, at 8.20 am, the complainant/prosecuterix made a supplementary statement to the police. On this occasion, she alleged, that Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused, had been having physical relations with her in his house, on the assurance

-

that he would marry her. It was alleged by the complainant/prosecuterix, that the appellant-accused had subsequently refused to marry her. With reference to the incident of 15.2.2007, she alleged, that she had been administered some intoxicant in a cold drink (Pepsi) by Prashant Bharti, so as to enable him to have a physical relationship with her. But, it was alleged, that she did not succumb to his said desire on 15.2.2007. The complainant/prosecuterix further alleged, that after she returned to her residence on 15.2.2007, she did not feel well and accordingly, had gone to sleep. She therefore explained, why she had made her earlier complaint, on the following day of the incident. In her supplementary statement, she requested the police to take legal action against Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused, for having physical relations with her (on 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006 and 1.1.2007) at his residence, on the basis of a false promise to marry her.

6. Immediately after recording her supplementary statement, the complainant/prosecuterix was taken to the AIIMS. She was medically examined at the AIIMS at 12 noon, on 21.2.2007. In the medical report prepared at the AIIMS after her examination, it was recorded, that she had no external injuries, and that her hymen was not intact. It was pointed out, that a vaginal smear was not taken, because more than a month had elapsed from the date of the alleged intercourse(s). Likewise, it was pointed out, that her clothes were not sent for forensic examination, because she had changed the clothes worn by her at the time of the alleged occurrence(s). In other words, the assertions made by the -

accused could not be tested scientifically, because the complainant was being medically examined, after a substantial delay.

7. Based on the supplementary statement of Priya (the complainant/prosecuterix) recorded on 21.2.2007, the offence under Section 376 was added to the case.

8. On 27.2.2007, the statement of the complainant/prosecuterix was recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi (in first information report no. 47 of 2007). A relevant extract of the aforesaid statement, is being reproduced below:-

“… then Prashant asked for my number and detail of address. I gave my office telephone number to him. In evening, Mr. Prashant Bharti called me and talked about loan and after some days, Prashant Bharti came to meet in my office and thereafter we became good friends and one day, Prashant Bharti told me that he loves me and wish to marry me and thereafter, we started meeting frequently and I consented for marriage.
One day, when all the family members were gone somewhere, Prashant Bharti called me to his home for party and he told me that he will marry me soon and will inform to his parents about our relationship and he made relation with me. And, whenever his home was vacant, he usually calls me up and when his parents came, I asked him to tell them about our relationship and he did not inform this and on this issue, we have fight with each other and I informed to his parents. Then his parents called Prashant about this and Prashant Bharti denied our relationship to his father and neither he wish to marry me and on that day, I was sent to my home by his parents.
After two days, Prashant Bharti called me and asked me to meet him, as he wish to tender apology and when I was going to reach my home from office, then I, through auto rickshaw, reached at Central School, Lodhi Colony, where Prashant Bharti was standing near to his Santro Car, and he met me there and he asked me that he has committed mistake and he wish to tender apology and after some -
time, he took me to his car and thereafter, he told me that he is feeling thirsty and thereafter, he brought Pepsi in car and we both took the Pepsi. And, after drinking the same, I lost my conscious and thereafter, he started misbehaving with me and I asked him that why he was doing so, then he told me that, as I complained to his father, he will take revenge from me, and he forcibly misbehaved with me, and I immediately got down from the car and by Auto, I came to my house and as I was unwell, I could not lodge my complaint with police. On the next day, I called 100 number PCR and there police official, accompanies me and I informed everything to SHO Surinder Jeet and on that basis, he was arrested.”
9. By an order dated 12.3.2007, the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi granted bail to the appellant-accused. In the aforesaid order passed on 12.3.2007, the following factual position was relied upon, to extend the benefit of bail to the appellant-accused. The appellant-accused was in Sector 37, Noida in the State of Uttar Pradesh on 15.2.2007. He was at Noida before 7.55 pm. He, thereafter, remained at different places within Noida and then at Shakarpur, Ghaziabad, Patparganj, Jorbagh etc. From 9.15 pm to 11.30 pm on 15.2.2007, he remained present at a marriage anniversary function celebrated at Rangoli Lawns at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. An affidavit to the aforesaid effect filed by the appellant-accused was found to be correct by the investigating officer, on the basis of his mobile phone call details. Verification of the mobile phone call details of the complainant/prosecuterix Priya revealed, that on 15.2.2007, no calls were made by the appellant-accused to the complainant/prosecuterix, and that, it was the complainant/prosecuterix who had made calls to him. The complainant/prosecuterix, on and around the time referred to in the complaint dated 16.2.2007, was at different places of New Delhi i.e., in Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Andrews Ganj and finally at -

Tughlakabad Extension, as per the verification of the investigating officer on the basis of her mobile phone call details. Even though the complainant/prosecuterix was married to one Manoj Kumar Soni, S/o Seeta Ram Soni (as indicated in an affidavit appended to the Delhi police format for information of tenants and duly verified by the investigating officer, wherein she had described herself as married), in the complaint made to the police (on 16.2.2007 and 21.2.2007), she had suggested that she was not married. At the time when the complainant/prosecuterix alleged, that the appellant-accused had misbehaved with her and had outraged her modesty on 15.2.2007 (per her complaint dated 16.2.2007), she was actually in conversation with her friends (as per the verification made by the investigating officer on the basis of her mobile phone call details). Even though the complainant/prosecuterix had merely alleged in her complaint dated 16.2.2007, that the accused had outraged her modesty by touching her breasts, she had subsequently through a supplementary statement (on 21.2.2007), levelled further allegations against the accused of having repeatedly raped her (on 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006 and 1.1.2007), on dates preceding the first complaint.

10. On 28.6.2007, the police filed a chargesheet under Sections 328, 354 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code. In the chargesheet, it was clearly mentioned, that the police investigation, from different angles, had not yielded any positive result. However, the chargesheet was based on the statement made by the complainant/prosecuterix before the Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was found to be sufficient for the charges alleged - against the appellant-accused. A relevant extract of the chargesheet depicting the aforesaid factual position, is being reproduced below:-

“I the Inspector, tried my best from all angles to recover the intoxicating substance/Pepsi/Pepsi glass and undergarments worn at the time of the rape. But nothing could be recovered and for this reason, the blood sample of accused could not be sent to FSL. As from the investigation so far conducted, no proof could be found in support of the crime under Section 328/354 IPC and even the position of accused Prashant Bharti is not available at Lodhi Colony at the date and time as his mobile phone ill. However, prosecuterix Priya Porwal made statement on 21.2.2007 and on 27.2.2007 under Section 164 Cr.P.C. which is sufficient in support of his challan for the offence under Section 376 IPC.” (emphasis is ours)
11. Aggrieved by the first information report (bearing no. 47 -

of 2007) registered at the Police Station Lodhi Colony, New Delhi, the appellant-accused filed Writ Petition (Crl.) no. 1112 of 2007 before the Delhi High Court for quashing the said first information report on the ground, that the appellant-accused had been falsely implicated. The High Court, dismissed the said writ petition on 27.8.2007, without going into the merits of the controversy, by recording the following observations:-

“This Court cannot quash the FIR on the ground that FIR was false FIR. In case of a false FIR, it must be brought to its logical conclusion and Investigating Officer must give a report to that effect. In this case, if it is found that the petitioner has been falsely implicated and the complaint was false, it would be obligatory on the part of the Investigating Officer to register a case and book the prosecuterix for falsely implicating the person in an offence under Section 376 IPC.
It is a very serious matter that a prosecuterix just by making a false statement can book somebody in offence under Section 376 IPC, which is serious in nature and invites a minimum punishment of 07 years. I consider that Investigating Officer shall submit a detailed report and in case, it is that the petitioner was falsely implicated, he would take steps for booking the complainant for falsely implicating the petitioner.”

-

12. Interestingly, even the complainant/prosecuterix filed Writ Petition (Crl.) no. 257 of 2008 before the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the first information report lodged by the complainant/prosecuterix herself. The High Court noticed the observations recorded in the order dated 27.8.2007 (passed in Writ Petition (Crl.) no. 1112 of 2007) and dismissed the writ petition filed by the complainant/prosecutrix.

13. On 1.12.2008, the Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi, framed charges against the appellant-accused, by observing as under:-

“4. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case that prosecuterix has levelled specific allegations against the accused that she was given pepsi to drink and after consuming the same she was intoxicated and accused teased her, moved his hands on her breast and earlier made physical relations with her on the assurance of marriage, I am of the considered opinion that prosecution has brought prima facie sufficient material on record against the accused for charge under Sections 354/328/376 IPC. Let charge be framed accordingly.”
14. Dissatisfied with the action of the trial Court in framing charges against him, the appellant-accused filed Criminal Revision Petition no. 08 of 2009, whereby he assailed the order dated 1.12.2008 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi. The Delhi High Court dismissed the revision petition on 16.1.2009, by interalia observing as under:-

“12. Truthfulness or falsity of the allegations, essentially pertains to the realm of evidence and the same cannot be pre-judged at this initial stage. I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order. Consequently, this Revision Petition is dismissed in limine while making it clear that anything herein shall not be construed as an opinion on merits at trial.”
15. Despite notice having been issued to the complainant/prosecuterix by this Court in the present case, she failed to enter personal appearance (or be represented through counsel). To procure her presence, bailable -

warrants were issued in furtherance of this Court’s order dated 12.5.2010 and again on 16.10.2012. Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix entered personal appearance on 8.11.2012. During the course of hearing, consequent upon clarifications sought from her in respect of her marital status (at the time of the alleged occurrences with the appellant-accused), she informed this Court, that even though she was married earlier, she had divorced her previous husband before the dates of occurrence. To verify the factual position pertaining to her marital status as on the dates of occurrence(s), she was asked to produce the judgment and decree of divorce, from her previous husband. She accordingly produced a certified copy of the judgment and decree of the Court of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kanpur (Rural) dated 23.9.2008. A photocopy thereof duly attested by Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix, and her counsel, were taken on record. A perusal of the same reveals, that the complainant/prosecuterix was married to Lalji Porwal on 14.6.2003. She was divorced from her said husband by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, on 23.9.2008. Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix also affirmed, that she had remarried thereafter. She also produced before us a “certificate of marriage” dated 30.9.2008. A photocopy thereof duly attested by Priya and her counsel, was also taken on record. A perusal of the same reveals, that Priya (date of birth, 17.6.1986), daughter of Anup Kumar was married to Manoj (date of birth, 8.12.1983), son of Ram Kumar, on 30.9.2008.

16. The factual position narrated above would enable us to draw some positive inferences on the assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix - against the appellant-accused (in the supplementary statement dated 21.2.2007). It is relevant to notice, that she had alleged, that she was induced into a physical relationship by Prashant Bharti, on the assurance that he would marry her. Obviously, an inducement for marriage is understandable if the same is made to an unmarried person. The judgment and decree dated 23.9.2008 reveals, that the complainant/prosecuterix was married to Lalji Porwal on 14.6.2003. It also reveals, that the aforesaid marriage subsisted till 23.9.2008, when the two divorced one another by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act. In her supplementary statement dated 21.2.2007, the complainant/prosecuterix accused Prashant Bhati of having had physical relations with her on 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006 and 1.1.2007 at his residence, on the basis of a false promise to marry her. It is apparent from irrefutable evidence, that during the dates under reference and for a period of more than one year and eight months thereafter, she had remained married to Lalji Porwal. In such a fact situation, the assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix, that the appellant-accused had physical relations with her, on the assurance that he would marry her, is per se false and as such, unacceptable. She, more than anybody else, was clearly aware of the fact that she had a subsisting valid marriage with Lalji Porwal. Accordingly, there was no question of anyone being in a position to induce her into a physical relationship under an assurance of marriage. If the judgment and decree dated 23.9.2008 produced before us by the complainant/prosecuterix herself is taken into consideration alongwith the factual position depicted in the supplementary statement dated 21.2.2007, -

it would clearly emerge, that the complainant/prosecuterix was in a relationship of adultery on 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006 and 1.1.2007 with the appellant-accused, while she was validly married to her previous husband Lalji Porwal. In the aforesaid view of the matter, we are satisfied that the assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix, that she was induced to a physical relationship by Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused, on the basis of a promise to marry her, stands irrefutably falsified.

17. Would it be possible for the prosecution to establish a sexual relationship between Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix and Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused, is the next question which we shall attempt to answer. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, medical evidence discussed above reveals, that the complaint made by the complainant/prosecuterix alleging a sexual relationship with her by Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused, was made more than one month after the alleged occurrences. It was, therefore, that during the course of her medical examination at the AIIMS, a vaginal smear was not taken. Her clothes were also not sent for forensic examination by the AIIMS, because she had allegedly changed the clothes which she had worn at the time of occurrence. In the absence of any such scientific evidence, the proof of sexual intercourse between the complainant/prosecuterix and the appellant-

accused would be based on an assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix. And an unequivocal denial thereof, by the appellant-accused. One’s word against the other. Based on the falsity of the statement made by the complainant/prosecuterix noticed above (and other such like falsities, to be narrated hereafter), it is unlikely, that a - factual assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix, would be acceptable over that of the appellant-accused. For the sake of argument, even if it is assumed, that Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused and Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix, actually had a physical relationship, as alleged, the same would necessarily have to be consensual, since it is the case of the complainant/prosecuterix herself, that the said physical relationship was with her consent consequent upon the assurance of marriage. But then, the discussion above, clearly negates such an assurance. A consensual relationship without any assurance, obviously will not substantiate the offence under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, alleged against Prashant Bharti.

18. Insofar as the assertion made by the complainant/prosecuterix, in her first complaint dated 16.2.2007 is concerned, it is apparent, that on the basis thereof, first information report no. 47 of 2007 was registered at Police Station Lodhi Colony, New Delhi. In her aforesaid complaint, Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix had alleged, that the appellant-accused had called her on her phone at 8.45 pm and asked her to meet him at Lodhi Colony, New Delhi. When she reached there, he drove her around in his car.

He also offered her a cold drink (Pepsi) containing a poisonous/intoxicating substance. Having consumed the cold drink, she is stated to have felt inebriated, whereupon, he took advantage of her and started misbehaving with her, and also touched her breasts. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, the presence of the complainant/prosecuterix, as well as the appellant-accused, at the alleged place of occurrence (Lodhi Colony, New Delhi), on the night of - 15.2.2007 after 8.45 pm, has been established to be false on the basis of mobile phone call details of the parties concerned. Details in this respect have been summarized in paragraph 8 above. The same are not being repeated for reasons of brevity. The proof of the aforesaid factual matter must be considered to be conclusive for all intents and purposes, specially, in view of the observations made by this Court in Gajraj Vs. State (NCT) of Delhi [(2011) 10 SCC 675], wherein it was held as under:-

“19. In the aforesaid sense of the matter, the discrepancy in the statement of Minakshi PW23, pointed out by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant, as also, the reasoning rendered by the High Court in the impugned judgment becomes insignificant. We are satisfied, that the process by which the accused-appellant came to be identified during the course of investigation, was legitimate and unassailable. The IEMI number of the handset, on which the accused-appellant was making calls by using a mobile phone (sim) registered in his name, being evidence of a conclusive nature, cannot be overlooked on the basis of such like minor discrepancies . In fact even a serious discrepancy in oral evidence, would have had to yield to the aforesaid authentic digital evidence which is a byproduct of machine operated electronic record having no manual interference. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we find no merit in the first contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the accused-
appellant.” The aforesaid factual conclusion, that the two concerned parties were not present at Lodhi Colony, New Delhi after 8.45 pm on 15.2.2007, as has been established on the basis of the investigation carried out by the police, cannot be altered at the culmination of the trial, since the basis of the aforesaid determination is scientific evidence. Neither has the said material been contested by the complainant/prosecutrix. Once it is concluded, that the complainant/prosecuterix and the appellant-accused were at different places, far away from one another, and certainly not in -

Lodhi Colony, New Delhi on the night of 15.2.2007, it is obvious that the allegation made by Priya, the complainant/prosecuterix against Prashant Bharti, the appellant-accused of having outraged her modesty, was false. What stands established now, as has been discussed above, will have to be reaffirmed on the basis of the same evidence at the culmination of the trial. Such being the fact situation, we have no other alternative but to conclude, that the allegations levelled by the complainant/prosecuterix, which culminated in the registration of a first information report at Police Station Lodhi Colony, New Delhi on 16.2.2007, as well as her supplementary statement, would never lead to his conviction.

19. The proposition of law, pertaining to quashing of criminal proceedings, initiated against an accused by a High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as “the Cr.P.C.”) has been dealt with by this Court in Rajiv Thapar & Ors. vs. Madan Lal Kapoor (Criminal Appeal No…… of 2013, arising out of SLP (Crl.) no.4883 of 2008, decided on 23.1.2013) wherein this Court inter alia held as under:

22. The issue being examined in the instant case is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., if it chooses to quash the initiation of the prosecution against an accused, at the stage of issuing process, or at the stage of committal, or even at the stage of framing of charges. These are all stages before the commencement of the actual trial. The same parameters would naturally be available for later stages as well. The power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., at the stages referred to hereinabove, would have far reaching consequences, inasmuch as, it would negate the prosecution’s/complainant’s case without allowing the prosecution/complainant to lead evidence. Such a determination must always be rendered with caution, care and circumspection. To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section -
482 of the Cr.P.C. the High Court has to be fully satisfied, that the material produced by the accused is such, that would lead to the conclusion, that his/their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts; the material produced is such, as would rule out and displace the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused; and the material produced is such, as would clearly reject and overrule the veracity of the allegations contained in the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant. It should be sufficient to rule out, reject and discard the accusations levelled by the prosecution/complainant, without the necessity of recording any evidence. For this the material relied upon by the defence should not have been refuted, or alternatively, cannot be justifiably refuted, being material of sterling and impeccable quality. The material relied upon by the accused should be such, as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the actual basis of the accusations as false. In such a situation, the judicial conscience of the High Court would persuade it to exercise its power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash such criminal proceedings, for that would prevent abuse of process of the court, and secure the ends of justice.
23. Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing, raised by an accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.:-

(i) Step one, whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable, i.e., the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?

(ii) Step two, whether the material relied upon by the accused, would rule out the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused, i.e., the material is sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint, i.e., the material is such, as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false.

(iii) Step three, whether the material relied upon by the accused, has not been refuted by the prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such, that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution/complainant?

(iv) Step four, whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice?

If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, judicial conscience of the High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal -

proceedings, in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as, proceedings arising therefrom) specially when, it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused.”

20. The details in respect of each aspect of the matter, arising out of the complaints made by Priya on 16.2.2007 and 21.2.2007 have been examined in extensive detail in the foregoing paragraphs. We shall now determine whether the steps noticed by this Court in the judgment extracted hereinabove can be stated to have been satisfied. In so far as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, the factual details referred to in the foregoing paragraphs are being summarized hereafter. Firstly, the appellant-accused was in Sector 37, Noida in the State of Uttar Pradesh on 15.2.2007. He was at Noida before 7.55 pm. He, thereafter, remained at different places within Noida and then at Shakarpur, Ghaziabad, Patparganj, Jorbagh etc. From 9.15 pm to 11.30 pm on 15.2.2007, he remained present at a marriage anniversary function celebrated at Rangoli Lawns at Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. An affidavit to the aforesaid effect filed by the appellant- accused was found to be correct by the investigating officer on the basis of his mobile phone call details. The accused was therefore not at the place of occurrence, as alleged in the complaint dated 16.2.2007. Secondly, verification of the mobile phone call details of the complainant/prosecuterix Priya revealed, that on 15.2.2007, no calls were made by the appellant-accused to the complainant/prosecuterix, and that, it was the complainant/prosecuterix who had made calls to him. Thirdly, the complainant/prosecuterix, on and around the time referred to in the -

complaint dated 16.2.2007, was at different places of New Delhi i.e., in Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Andrews Ganj and finally at Tughlakabad Extension, as per the verification of the investigating officer on the basis of her mobile phone call details. The complainant was also not at the place of occurrence, as she herself alleged in the complaint dated 16.2.2007. Fourthly, at the time when the complainant/prosecuterix alleged, that the appellant-accused had misbehaved with her and had outraged her modesty on 15.2.2007 (as per her complaint dated 16.2.2007), she was actually in conversation with her friends (as per the verification made by the investigating officer on the basis of her mobile phone call details). Fifthly, even though the complainant/prosecuterix had merely alleged in her complaint dated 16.2.2007, that the accused had outraged her modesty by touching her breasts, she had subsequently through a supplementary statement (on 21.2.2007), levelled allegations against the accused for offence of rape. Sixthly, even though the complainant/prosecuterix was married to one Manoj Kumar Soni, s/o Seeta Ram Soni (as indicated in an affidavit appended to the Delhi police format for information of tenants and duly verified by the investigating officer, wherein she had described herself as married), in the complaint made to the police (on 16.2.2007 and 21.2.2007), she had suggested that she was unmarried. Seventhly, as per the judgment and decree of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kanpur (Rural) dated 23.9.2008, the complainant was married to Lalji Porva on 14.6.2003. The aforesaid marriage subsisted till 23.9.2008. The allegations made by the complainant dated 16.2.2007 and 21.2.2007 pertain to occurrences of 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006, 1.1.2007 and -

15.2.2007, i.e., positively during the subsistence of her marriage with Lalji Porwal. Thereafter, the complainant Priya married another man Manoj on 30.9.2008. This is evidenced by a “certificate of marriage” dated 30.9.2008. In view of the aforesaid, it is apparent that the complainant could not have been induced into a physical relationship, based on an assurance of marriage. Eighthly, the physical relationship between the complainant and the accused was admittedly consensual. In her complaints Priya had however asserted, that her consent was based on a false assurance of marriage by the accused. Since the aspect of assurance stands falsified, the acknowledged consensual physical relationship between the parties would not constitute an offence under Section 376 IPC. Especially because the complainant was a major on the date of occurrences, which fact emerges from the “certificate of marriage” dated 30.9.2008, indicating her date of birth as 17.7.1986. Ninthly, as per the medical report recorded by the AIIMS dated 16.2.2007, the examination of the complainant did not evidence her having been poisoned. The instant allegation made by the complainant cannot now be established because even in the medical report dated 16.2.2007 it was observed that blood samples could not be sent for examination because of the intervening delay. For the same reason even the allegations levelled by the accused of having been administered some intoxicant in a cold drink (Pepsi) cannot now be established by cogent evidence. Tenthly, The factual position indicated in the charge-sheet dated 28.6.2007, that despite best efforts made by the investigating officer, the police could not recover the container of the cold drink (Pepsi) or the glass from which the -

complainant had consumed the same. The allegations made by the complainant could not be verified even by the police from any direct or scientific evidence, is apparent from a perusal of the charge-sheet dated 28.6.2007. Eleventhly, as per the medical report recorded by the AIIMS dated 21.2.2007 the assertions made by the complainant that the accused had physical relations with her on 23.12.2006, 25.12.2006 and 1.1.2007, cannot likewise be verified as opined in the medical report, on account of delay between the dates of occurrences and her eventual medical examination on 21.2.2007. It was for this reason, that neither the vaginal smear was taken, nor her clothes were sent for forensic examination.

21. Most importantly, as against the aforesaid allegations, no pleadings whatsoever have been filed by the complainant. Even during the course of hearing, the material relied upon by the accused was not refuted. As a matter of fact, the complainant/prosecutrix had herself approached the High Court, with the prayer that the first information lodged by her, be quashed. It would therefore be legitimate to conclude, in the facts and circumstances of this case, that the material relied upon by the accused has not been refuted by the complainant/prosecutrix. Even in the charge sheet dated 28.6.2007, (extracted above) the investigating officer has acknowledged, that he could not find any proof to substantiate the charges. The charge-sheet had been filed only on the basis of the statement of the complainant/prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C.

22. Based on the holistic consideration of the facts and circumstances summarized in the foregoing two paragraphs; we are satisfied, that all the steps delineated by this Court in Rajiv Thapar’s case (supra) stand - satisfied. All the steps can only be answered in the affirmative. We therefore have no hesitation whatsoever in concluding, that judicial conscience of the High Court ought to have persuaded it, on the basis of the material available before it, while passing the impugned order, to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against the accused-appellant, in exercise of the inherent powers vested with it under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Accordingly, based on the conclusions drawn hereinabove, we are satisfied, that the first information report registered under Sections 328, 354 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant-accused, and the consequential chargesheet dated 28.6.2007, as also the framing of charges by the Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi on 1.12.2008, deserves to be quashed. The same are accordingly quashed.

Disposed of in the aforesaid terms.",1
"Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd.","2. The appellant, insurance company, is in appeal by special leave against the judgment and order dated 23.03.2011 whereby the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court allowed the review petition and reviewed its order dated 09.11.2010 and held that the insurance company was liable to pay compensation in sum of Rs. 2,88,000/- with 9% interest thereon to the claimant awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in its award dated 23.07.2002.

3. The question of law that arises in this appeal is as to whether having regard to the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short, ‘1988 Act’), the insurance company is liable to pay compensation for the bodily injury caused to the claimant who was travelling in a goods vehicle as a spare driver though he was employed as a driver in another vehicle owned by the owner of the vehicle under the policy of insurance.

4. The above question arises in this way. Saju P. Paul, claimant (Respondent No. 1), was a heavy vehicle driver. He was employed with Respondent No. 2 as a driver in some other vehicle. On 16.10.1993, he was travelling in a goods vehicle bearing No. KL-2A/3411 in the cabin. The goods vehicle was being driven by one Jayakumar. In that vehicle, many other persons were also travelling. At Nilackal, due to rash and negligent driving of the driver Jayakumar, the goods vehicle capsized. As a result of which the claimant suffered fracture and injuries. The claimant remained under treatment for quite some time and the injuries that he sustained in the accident rendered him permanently disabled. In the claim petition filed by him before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Pathanamthitta (for short, ‘the Tribunal’), he claimed compensation of Rs.3,00,000/-. The owner and insurer were impleaded as respondent no. 2 and respondent no. 3 respectively in the claim petition.

5. The insurer filed its written statement and opposed the claimant’s claim insofar as it was concerned. The insurer set up the plea that the vehicle was a goods vehicle and the risk of the passengers travelling in the goods vehicle was not covered under the policy of insurance. It was stated in the written statement that nearly 50 unauthorised passengers were travelling at the time of accident; they were not traveling in the vehicle in pursuance of the contract of employment, such as loading and unloading nor they were travelling as the owner of the goods or the representative of the owner of the goods and hence the insurer could not be saddled with any liability.

6. The Tribunal, after recording the evidence and hearing the parties, on 23.07.2002, passed an award in favour of the claimant holding that he was entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/-. The liability of the insurer was made joint and several with the owner and driver.

7. Being not satisfied with the award of the Tribunal, the insurer filed an appeal before the Kerala High Court. The Division Bench of that Court by relying upon decisions of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asha Rani and others[1] and National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Cholleti Bharatamma and Others[2] allowed the appeal of the insurer vide judgment and order dated 09.11.2010. The Division Bench held that insurer was not liable as gratuitous passengers travelling in a goods vehicle were not covered under the policy and the claimant shall be entitled to recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver of the vehicle.

8. The claimant sought review of the order dated 09.11.2010 and, as noted above, by the impugned order that review application has been allowed. While allowing the review application, the Division Bench held as under:

“It has already been noticed that the petitioner was admittedly a spare driver of the vehicle. It may be true that he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant point of time; but he was directed to go to the worksite by his employer as a spare driver in the vehicle. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the petitioner was not travelling in the vehicle in the course of his employment and as directed by his employer. Section 147(1)(b)(i) takes within its fold any liability which may be incurred by the insurer in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person. Therefore, the argument of the insurance company that no goods were being carried in the vehicle at the time of accident and therefore, the petitioner was only a gratuitous passenger cannot be countenanced at all. Even otherwise, the first proviso to Section147(1) will cast a liability on the insurer to indemnify the owner in respect of the injury sustained by the employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment.”
9. It is appropriate to quote Section 147 of the 1988 Act as was obtaining on the date of accident, i.e., 16.10.1993, which reads as follows :

“147. Requirements of policies and limits of liability.—(1) In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter, a policy of insurance must be a policy which—
(a) is issued by a person who is an authorized insurer; and
(b) insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in sub-section (2)—
(i) against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place;
(ii) against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place:
Provided that a policy shall not be required—
(i) to cover liability in respect of the death, arising out of and in the course of his employment, of the employee of a person insured by the policy or in respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (8 of 1923), in respect of the death of, or bodily injury to, any such employee—
(a) engaged in driving the vehicle, or
(b) if it is a public service vehicle engaged as a conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets on the vehicle, or
(c) if it is a goods carriage, being carried in the vehicle, or
(ii) to cover any contractual liability.
Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party shall be deemed to have been caused by or to have arisen out of, the use of a vehicle in a public place notwithstanding that the person who is dead or injured or the property which is damaged was not in a public place at the time of the accident, if the act or omission which led to the accident occurred in a public place. (2) Subject to the proviso to sub-section (1), a policy of insurance referred to in sub-section (1), shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any accident, up to the following limits, namely—
(a) save as provided in clause (b), the amount of liability incurred;
(b) in respect of damage to any property of a third party, a limit of rupees six thousand:
Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any limited liability and in force, immediately before the commencement of this Act, shall continue to be effective for a period of four months after such commencement or till the date of expiry of such policy whichever is earlier.
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this Chapter unless and until there is issued by the insurer in favour of the person by whom the policy is effected a certificate of insurance in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the policy is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and different forms, particulars and matters may be prescribed in different cases.
(4) Where a cover note issued by the insurer under the provisions of this Chapter or the rules made thereunder is not followed by a policy of insurance within the prescribed time, the insurer shall, within seven days of the expiry of the period of the validity of the cover note, notify the fact to the registering authority in whose records the vehicle to which the cover note relates has been registered or to such other authority as the State Government may prescribe. (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, an insurer issuing a policy of insurance under this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those classes of persons.”
10. By the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994 (for short, ‘1994 Amendment Act’), Section 147 came to be amended. The expression “including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle” was added in Section 147. The amended Section 147 has been considered by this Court in various decisions, some of which we intend to refer a little later.

11. In New India Assurance Company v. Satpal Singh and others[3], this Court with reference to the provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the provisions in 1988 Act, particularly Section 147, held that under the 1988 Act an insurance policy covering third party risk was not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in a vehicle no matter that the vehicle is of any type or class. It was also held that the earlier decisions of this Court rendered under the 1939 Act vis-à-vis gratuitous passengers were of no avail while considering the liability of the insurance company in respect of any accident which occurred or would occur after the 1988 Act came into force.

12. The correctness of the judgment in Satpal Singh3 was doubted, inter alia, in Asha Rani1 . It was felt that Satpal Singh3 needed re-look insofar as cases covered under the 1988 Act prior to its amendment in 1994 were concerned. A three-Judge Bench in Asha Rani1 noticed Section 147 of the 1988 Act prior to its amendment in 1994 and after its amendment in 1994 and held in paragraph 9 of the Report (Pgs. 231-232) as follows :

“In Satpal case [(2000) 1 SCC 237] the Court assumed that the provisions of Section 95(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 are identical with Section 147(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, as it stood prior to its amendment. But a careful scrutiny of the provisions would make it clear that prior to the amendment of 1994 it was not necessary for the insurer to insure against the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle. On an erroneous impression this Court came to the conclusion that the insurer would be liable to pay compensation in respect of the death or bodily injury caused to either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative when being carried in a goods vehicle the accident occurred. If the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act of 1994 is examined, particularly Section 46, by which the expression “injury to any person” in the original Act stood substituted by the expression “injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle”, the conclusion is irresistible that prior to the aforesaid Amendment Act of 1994, even if the widest interpretation is given to the expression “to any person” it will not cover either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in the vehicle. The objects and reasons of clause 46 also state that it seeks to amend Section 147 to include owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle for the purposes of liability under the insurance policy. It is no doubt true that sometimes the legislature amends the law by way of amplification and clarification of an inherent position which is there in the statute, but a plain meaning being given to the words used in the statute, as it stood prior to its amendment of 1994, and as it stands subsequent to its amendment in 1994 and bearing in mind the objects and reasons engrafted in the amended provisions referred to earlier, it is difficult for us to construe that the expression “including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle” which was added to the pre-existing expression “injury to any person” is either clarificatory or amplification of the pre-existing statute. On the other hand it clearly demonstrates that the legislature wanted to bring within the sweep of Section 147 and making it compulsory for the insurer to insure even in case of a goods vehicle, the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle met with an accident and the owner of the goods or his representative either dies or suffers bodily injury. The judgment of this Court in Satpal case therefore must be held to have not been correctly decided and the impugned judgment of the Tribunal as well as that of the High Court accordingly are set aside and these appeals are allowed. It is held that the insurer will not be liable for paying compensation to the owner of the goods or his authorised representative on being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle meets with an accident and the owner of the goods or his representative dies or suffers any bodily injury.”
13. S.B. Sinha, J. in his supplementary judgment in Asha Rani1 , while concurring with the above, observed as follows (Pg. 235):

“26. In view of the changes in the relevant provisions in the 1988 Act vis-à-vis the 1939 Act, we are of the opinion that the meaning of the words “any person” must also be attributed having regard to the context in which they have been used i.e. “a third party”. Keeping in view the provisions of the 1988 Act, we are of the opinion that as the provisions thereof do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger travelling in a goods vehicle, the insurers would not be liable therefor.
27. Furthermore, sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 147 speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place, whereas sub-clause (ii) thereof deals with liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place.
28. An owner of a passenger-carrying vehicle must pay premium for covering the risks of the passengers. If a liability other than the limited liability provided for under the Act is to be enhanced under an insurance policy, additional premium is required to be paid. But if the ratio of this Court's decision in New India Assurance Co. v. Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] is taken to its logical conclusion, although for such passengers, the owner of a goods carriage need not take out an insurance policy, they would be deemed to have been covered under the policy wherefor even no premium is required to be paid.
14. Asha Rani1 has been relied upon in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Devireddy Konda Reddy and Others[4] wherein it was held as under (Pgs. 342-343):

“….The difference in the language of “goods vehicle” as appearing in the old Act and “goods carriage” in the Act is of significance. A bare reading of the provisions makes it clear that the legislative intent was to prohibit goods vehicle from carrying any passenger. This is clear from the expression “in addition to passengers” as contained in the definition of “goods vehicle” in the old Act. The position becomes further clear because the expression used is “goods carriage” is solely for the carriage of “goods”. Carrying of passengers in a goods carriage is not contemplated in the Act. There is no provision similar to clause (ii) of the proviso appended to Section 95 of the old Act prescribing requirement of insurance policy. Even Section 147 of the Act mandates compulsory coverage against death of or bodily injury to any passenger of “public service vehicle”. The proviso makes it further clear that compulsory coverage in respect of drivers and conductors of public service vehicle and employees carried in goods vehicle would be limited to liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (in short “the WC Act”). There is no reference to any passenger in “goods carriage”.
14.1. Then in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Report (Pg. 343), this Court held in Devireddy Konda Reddy4 as under :

“10. The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that provisions of the Act do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger travelling in a goods carriage and the insurer would have no liability therefor.
11. Our view gets support from a recent decision of a three- Judge Bench of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asha Rani [(2003) 2 SCC 223] in which it has been held that Satpal Singh case [(2000) 1 SCC 237] was not correctly decided. That being the position, the Tribunal and the High Court were not justified in holding that the insurer had the liability to satisfy the award.”
15. In Cholleti Bharatamma2, this Court was concerned with the question about the liability of the insurance company to indemnify the owner of the vehicle in respect of death of passengers travelling in goods vehicle. The Court considered the applicability of Section 147 as it originally stood under 1988 Act and after its amendment in 1994. In relation to the accident that occurred on 16.12.1993 i.e., prior to the 1994 amendment in SLP(C) 7237-39/2003, this Court set aside the judgment of the High Court and allowed the appeal of the insurance company by observing as follows (Pg. 430):

“14. The date of accident being 16-12-1993, the amendment carried out in the year 1994 in Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act would not be applicable.
15. The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Nalgonda, by a judgment and award dated 13-11-1997 awarded various sums overruling the defence of the appellant herein that they were unauthorised passengers. The High Court, however, by reason of the impugned judgment, relying on or on the basis of a decision of this Court in Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] directed as under:
“The learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that the issue involved in these appeals is squarely covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237], wherein Their Lordships held that under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 all insurance policies covering third-party risks are not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in the vehicle though vehicle is of any type or class.
In view of the proposition of law laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision stated supra, these appeals are dismissed. No costs.”

16. Following the aforementioned principles, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained which is set aside. The appeals are allowed accordingly.” 15.1. With reference to the accident that took place on 24.12.1993 (prior to 1994 amendment) in SLP(C) Nos. 7241-43/2003, this Court in Cholleti Bharatamma2 in paragraphs 17,18,19,20 and 21 (Pgs. 430-431) held as under :

“17. In the aforementioned case, accident took place on 24-12- 1993. The respondents herein filed a claim petition claiming compensation for the death of one Kota Venkatarao who had allegedly paid a sum of Rs 20 for travelling in the lorry. The Tribunal held:
“In the absence of rebuttal evidence from the deceased and some others who travelled in the said vehicle in the capacity of owner of the luggage which was carried by them at the time of accident, it cannot be said that it is a violation of the policy, since it is not fundamental breach so as to afford to the insurer to eschew the liability altogether as per the decision in B.V. Nagaraju v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. [(1996) 4 SCC 647 : AIR 1996 SC 2054]”
18. The High Court, however, relying upon Satpal Singh [(2000) 1 SCC 237] opined:
“This issue raised in this appeal is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Satpal Singh wherein Their Lordships held that under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 all insurance policies covering third-party risks are not required to exclude gratuitous passengers in the vehicles though the vehicle is of any type or class. Following the same, the appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.”
19. It is now well settled that the owner of the goods means only the person who travels in the cabin of the vehicle.
20. In this case, the High Court had proceeded on the basis that they were gratuitous passengers. The admitted plea of the respondents themselves was that the deceased had boarded the lorry and paid an amount of Rs 20 as transport charges. It has not been proved that the deceased was travelling in the lorry along with the driver or the cleaner as the owner of the goods. Travelling with the goods itself does not entitle anyone to protection under Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
21. For the reasons aforementioned, this appeal is allowed.”
16. In the present case, Section 147 as originally existed in 1988 Act is applicable and, accordingly, the judgment of this Court in Asha Rani1 is fully attracted. The High Court was clearly in error in reviewing its judgment and order delivered on 09.11.2010 in review petition filed by the claimant by applying Section 147(1)(b)(i). The High Court committed grave error in holding that Section 147(1)(b)(i) takes within its fold any liability which may be incurred by the insurer in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person. The High Court also erred in holding that the claimant was travelling in the vehicle in the course of his employment since he was a spare driver in the vehicle although he was not driving the vehicle at the relevant time but he was directed to go to the worksite by his employer. The High Court erroneously assumed that the claimant died in the course of employment and overlooked the fact that the claimant was not in any manner engaged on the vehicle that met with an accident but he was employed as a driver in another vehicle owned by M/s. P.L. Construction Company. The insured (owner of the vehicle) got insurance cover in respect of the subject goods vehicle for driver and cleaner only and not for any other employee. There is no insurance cover for the spare driver in the policy. As a matter of law, the claimant did not cease to be a gratuitous passenger though he claimed that he was a spare driver. The insured had paid premium for one driver and one cleaner and, therefore, second driver or for that purpose ‘spare driver’ was not covered under the policy.

17. The High Court misconstrued the proviso following sub-section (1) of Section 147 of the 1988 Act. What is contemplated by proviso to Section 147 (1) is that the policy shall not be required to cover liability in respect of death or bodily injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923. The claimant was admittedly not driving the vehicle nor he was engaged in driving the said vehicle. Merely because he was travelling in a cabin would not make his case different from any other gratuitous passenger.

18. The impugned judgment is founded on misconstruction of Section

147. The High Court was wrong in holding that the insurance company shall be liable to indemnify the owner of the vehicle and pay the compensation to the claimant as directed in the award by the Tribunal.

19. The next question that arises for consideration is whether in the peculiar facts of this case a direction could be issued to the insurance company to first satisfy the awarded amount in favour of the claimant and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle (respondent no. 2 herein).

20. In National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Baljit Kaur and others[5], this Court was confronted with a similar situation. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in paragraph 21 of the Report (Pg. 8) held as under :

“21. The upshot of the aforementioned discussions is that instead and in place of the insurer the owner of the vehicle shall be liable to satisfy the decree. The question, however, would be as to whether keeping in view the fact that the law was not clear so long such a direction would be fair and equitable. We do not think so. We, therefore, clarify the legal position which shall have prospective effect. The Tribunal as also the High Court had proceeded in terms of the decision of this Court in Satpal Singh. The said decision has been overruled only in Asha Rani. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the interest of justice will be subserved if the appellant herein is directed to satisfy the awarded amount in favour of the claimant, if not already satisfied, and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. For the purpose of such recovery, it would not be necessary for the insurer to file a separate suit but it may initiate a proceeding before the executing court as if the dispute between the insurer and the owner was the subject-matter of determination before the Tribunal and the issue is decided against the owner and in favour of the insurer. We have issued the aforementioned directions having regard to the scope and purport of Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, in terms whereof, it is not only entitled to determine the amount of claim as put forth by the claimant for recovery thereof from the insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly or severally but also the dispute between the insurer on the one hand and the owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident inasmuch as can be resolved by the Tribunal in such a proceeding.”
21. The above position has been followed by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Challa Bharathamma & Ors.[6], wherein this Court in paragraph 13 (Pg. 523) observed as under:

“13. The residual question is what would be the appropriate direction. Considering the beneficial object of the Act, it would be proper for the insurer to satisfy the award, though in law it has no liability. In some cases the insurer has been given the option and liberty to recover the amount from the insured. For the purpose of recovering the amount paid from the owner, the insurer shall not be required to file a suit. It may initiate a proceeding before the executing court concerned as if the dispute between the insurer and the owner was the subject- matter of determination before the Tribunal and the issue is decided against the owner and in favour of the insurer. Before release of the amount to the claimants, owner of the offending vehicle shall furnish security for the entire amount which the insurer will pay to the claimants. The offending vehicle shall be attached, as a part of the security. If necessity arises the executing court shall take assistance of the Regional Transport Authority concerned. The executing court shall pass appropriate orders in accordance with law as to the manner in which the owner of the vehicle shall make payment to the insurer. In case there is any default it shall be open to the executing court to direct realisation by disposal of the securities to be furnished or from any other property or properties of the owner of the vehicle i.e. the insured. In the instant case, considering the quantum involved, we leave it to the discretion of the insurer to decide whether it would take steps for recovery of the amount from the insured.”
22. In National Insurance Company Limited v. Kaushalaya Devi and Others[7]. In paragraph 15 of the Report (pg. 250), the Court observed as follows:

“15. For the reasons aforementioned, civil appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 10694 is allowed and civil appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 9910 of 2006 is dismissed. If the amount deposited by the Insurance Company has since been withdrawn by the first respondent, it would be open to the Insurance Company to recover the same in the manner specified by the High Court. But if the same has not been withdrawn the deposited amount may be refunded to the Insurance Company and the proceedings for realisation of the amount may be initiated against the owner of the vehicle. In the facts and circumstances of the case, however, there shall be no order as to costs.”
23. We are informed that by an order dated 19.01.2007 in National Insurance Co. v. Roshan Lal and Another [SLP (C) No. 5699/2006] in light of the argument raised before a two-Judge Bench that the direction ought not to be issued to the insurance company to discharge the liability under the award first and then recover the same from the owner, the matter has been referred to the larger Bench by the following order:

“Having regard to the submissions urged before us, we are of the view that this petition may be placed for consideration before a larger Bench. We notice that in some of the decisions such a direction was made in cases where the compensation had already been paid by the insurer, but there are observations therein which support the view that such a direction can be made in all cases where the owner has insured his vehicle against third party risks. In Baljit Kaur’s case (supra) which is a judgment rendered by three Hon’ble Judges, such a direction was made in the special circumstances noticed by the Court in paragraph 21 of the report. There are observations in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Ranjit Saikia and Ors. (2002) 9 SCC 390 which may support the contention of the petitioners before us.”
24. In National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Parvathneni & Another [SLP(C)….CC No. 10993 of 2009], the following two questions have been referred to the larger Bench for consideration:

(1) If an Insurance Company can prove that it does not have any liability to pay any amount in law to the claimants under the Motor Vehicles Act or any other enactment, can the Court yet compel it to pay the amount in question giving it liberty to later on recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. (2) Can such a direction be given under Article 142 of the Constitution, and what is the scope of Article 142? Does Article 142 permit the Court to create a liability where there is none?”
25. The pendency of consideration of the above questions by a larger Bench does not mean that the course that was followed in Baljit Kaur5 and Challa Bharathamma6 should not be followed, more so in a peculiar fact situation of this case. In the present case, the accident occurred in 1993. At that time, claimant was 28 years’ old. He is now about 48 years. The claimant was a driver on heavy vehicle and due to the accident he has been rendered permanently disabled. He has not been able to get compensation so far due to stay order passed by this Court. He cannot be compelled to struggle further for recovery of the amount. The insurance company has already deposited the entire awarded amount pursuant to the order of this Court passed on 01.08.2011 and the said amount has been invested in a fixed deposit account. Having regard to these peculiar facts of the case in hand, we are satisfied that the claimant (Respondent No. 1) may be allowed to withdraw the amount deposited by the insurance company before this Court along-with accrued interest. The insurance company (appellant) thereafter may recover the amount so paid from the owner (Respondent No. 2 herein). The recovery of the amount by the insurance company from the owner shall be made by following the procedure as laid down by this Court in the case of Challa Bharathamma6 .

26. Appeal is allowed and disposed of as above with no order as to costs.",1
Mohd. Mehtab Khan & Ors.,"2. Aggrieved by the grant of interim relief by an Appellate Bench of the Bombay High Court in a suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (hereinafter for short the “SR Act”), the present appeal has been filed by the defendants 5, 10 and 11 in the suit. More specifically, by the impugned order dated 09.10.2012 the Receiver of the suit properties appointed by the learned Single Judge has been directed to remain in possession and hand over the same to the respondent Nos.1 and 2 (plaintiffs) who are to be in possession as agents of the Receiver.

3. Before embarking upon the necessary discussion of the factual matrix of the case, an identification of the contesting parties in the manner indicated below would be necessary.

4. The plaintiff No. 1 claims to be the 3rd wife of one Ibrahim Khan whereas the plaintiff No. 2 is the son of the first plaintiff and Ibrahim Khan. According to the plaintiffs, Ibrahim Khan and the first plaintiff were married in the year 1993 and out of the said wedlock the plaintiff No. 2 was born some time in the year 1996. The plaintiffs claim that they alongwith Ibrahim Khan were residing in flat No. A-505, Noor-e-Jahan Complex, Pipe Road, Kurla (West), Mumbai and that they were also in occupation of an office being 201/202, 2nd floor in the Big 3 Building, 88, Anandilal Poddar Marg, Marine Lines, Mumbai from where the first plaintiff was carrying on her profession of advocate and solicitors in the name of M/s. K.K. Associates. It is the case of the plaintiffs that both the aforesaid properties were the self-acquired properties of Ibrahim Khan and that the suit flat was gifted in favour of the first plaintiff whereas a general power of attorney was executed in favour of the first plaintiff insofar as the suit office is concerned.

5. The further case of the plaintiffs is that Ibrahim Khan had gone to Delhi on 28.11.2011 to attend a wedding. On 1.12.2011 the first plaintiff could come to know that Ibrahim Khan had suffered a brain hemorrhage and was admitted in the hospital. According to the plaintiffs, they took an early morning flight to Delhi on the very next day. However, at about 9.30/10.00 O’Clock in the morning, Ibrahim Khan died. Thereafter, at the insistence of the first defendant (brother of the deceased) the body of the deceased was taken to Bhagalpur, Bihar which was the native place of Ibrahim Khan. The plaintiffs accompanied the body of the deceased to Bhagalpur and the last rites were performed at the said place in the afternoon of 4.12.2011. On 5.12.2011 the plaintiff No. 1 received a call from her next door neighbour, one Nadeem, that the lock of the suit flat was broken and a new lock had been placed by some unknown persons. According to the plaintiffs, the first plaintiff called her house help Niranjan who informed her that the defendants 2, 3 and 4 had forcibly taken possession of the suit flat. It is also the case of the plaintiffs that when she had contacted her office she was informed that the defendant No. 4 had gone to the suit office and had snatched the keys from the office staff and had locked up the premises.

6. According to the plaintiffs, they reached Mumbai on 6.12.2011 and on going to the suit flat they found that new locks had been put thereon. They, thereafter, lodged a complaint to the police on 6.12.2011 and thereafter on 12.12.2011 instituted Suit No. 27 of 2012 under Section 6 of the SR Act. On 14.12.2011, when the matter was taken up by the Court, the defendant Nos. 1 to 4 informed the Court that they are not in possession of the suit flat but it is the defendants 5, 11 and 12 who are in possession. The Court by order dated 14.12.2011 appointed a Receiver and directed him to make an inspection of the suit flat and suit office and report back to the Court. Such inspection was made by the Court appointed Receiver on 16.12.2011. The report of inspection was submitted to the Court to the effect that the defendant Nos. 5 to 9 were found to be in possession of the suit flat. Formal possession thereof was taken over by the Court Receiver in terms of the order dated 14.12.2011. In the report of the Court Receiver, it was further mentioned that the defendant No. 10 had produced the keys of the suit office. However, the Court Receiver did not succeed in opening the doors of the office premises as there were further locks fixed thereon and inquiries did not indicate as to who was in possession of the keys. Accordingly, the Court Receiver informed the Court that formal possession of the suit office could not be taken. In the aforesaid circumstances, at the instance of the plaintiffs, defendants 5 to 12 were impleaded in the suit.

7. At this stage the specific case of the defendants as advanced before the learned Trial Judge, may be taken note of. The fact that the first plaintiff was the 3rd wife of Ibrahim Khan and the second plaintiff was the son born out of the said marriage is not disputed by the defendants. The death of Ibrahim Khan in the circumstances stated in the plaint is also not in dispute. According to the defendants, the appellants were residing in the suit premises with the deceased Ibrahim Khan till the middle of the year 2009 when the first plaintiff separated from the deceased. Thereafter, according to the defendants, the plaintiffs were not in possession of the suit flat and, instead, were staying in the house of the father of the first plaintiff at Mira Road. The second plaintiff was studying in a school located on Mira Road. It is the specific case of the defendants that the deceased, at the relevant time, was residing in the suit flat alongwith his son from the first wife (defendant No. 5) and that the defendants had inherited the suit flat on the death of Ibrahim Khan. Insofar as the suit office is concerned, it is the specific case of the defendants that the plaintiff No. 1 was not in possession of the said premises and that the said plaintiff No. 1 had been functioning from an office located at another place, i.e., shop No. 32/33 Ashoka Centre, 2nd floor, L.T. Marg, Mumbai.

8. Alongwith the respective pleadings of the parties elaborate documents had been laid before the learned Trial Judge on the basis of which contentions were advanced by the respective parties each claiming to be in possession of the suit flat and suit office on the relevant date in order to justify the reliefs that the respective parties were seeking from the Court. As would be evident from the order of the Appellate Bench of the High Court, insofar as the suit flat is concerned, the plaintiffs had produced as many as 50 documents details of which has been catalogued in a chronological order in the order dated 9.10.2012. Insofar as suit office is concerned, similarly, the plaintiffs had relied on as many as 31 documents to show their claim of possession. Likewise, the defendants had also relied on an equally long and elaborate list of documents to show that the plaintiffs were not in possession of the suit flat and suit office at the relevant point of time, as claimed. As the details of the said documents have been minutely taken note of by both the Benches of the High Court it is not necessary for this Court to traverse the said aspect of the case once again. Instead, we may briefly notice the reasons which had weighed with the learned Trial Judge to refuse interim relief to the plaintiffs and those that had prevailed upon the Appellate Bench to reverse the said order of the learned Trial Judge.

9. Both the learned Trial Judge as well as the Appellate Court considered the very same documents brought on record by the contesting parties to arrive at their respective conclusions with regard to the entitlement of the plaintiffs. Specifically, the learned Trial Judge had discussed the narration of the events of dispossession pleaded by the plaintiffs and held the same to be somewhat unreliable and inconsistent in view of the fact that the defendant No. 1 (son of the deceased Ibrahim Khan) who is alleged to have been instrumental in dispossessing the plaintiffs was at the relevant point of time in Bhagalpur in connection with the cremation of the deceased, Ibrahim Khan. In this regard the claim of defendants 2 to 4 that they were also in Bhagalpur at the relevant time was considered by the learned Trial Judge. The versions of the occurrence allegedly narrated to the plaintiff No. 1 by her neighbours and her domestic aid were also found to be somewhat contradictory. The learned Trial Judge took into account the fact that the plaintiffs’ version with regard to prosecution of studies by the second plaintiff in the school at Mira Road and his residing with the parents of the plaintiff No. 1 at Mira Road was brought on record in the rejoinder and did not constitute the part of the plaint case. In coming to his conclusions in the matter the learned Trial Judge also took into account the fact that the visiting card of the plaintiff No. 1 showed an address other than of the suit office and also the fact that the communication conveying the temporary membership of the plaintiff No. 1 in the Bombay Bar Association sent to the suit flat address was returned with the remarks “shifted”. The fact that the visiting card of the plaintiff showing the office address at Ashoka Centre contained the same telephone numbers of the plaintiff that were mentioned in certain communications of the bank were duly taken note of by the learned Trial Judge. In the above context the claim of the plaintiff No.1 that the said visiting card is a forged and fabricated document was held to be an issue fit for decision in the trial of the suit. The learned Trial Judge took into account the passports of both the plaintiffs issued in the year 2009 showing the address of the suit premises as well as the vouchers/memos showing payment by the plaintiff No.1 for the household and electronic goods which were found in the suit flat. On an overall consideration of the aforesaid facts and the documents laid in support thereof, the learned Trial Judge was of the view that there were inconsistencies and improbabilities in the case of the plaintiffs which needed to be established in the trial of the suit. Accordingly, the interim relief of direction to be put back in possession, as claimed by the plaintiffs, was declined.

10. The Appellate Court understood the very same documents considered by the learned Trial Judge in a wholly different manner. Specifically, it was held that the various household and electronic goods found in the suit flat during the inspection carried out by the Receiver on 16.12.2011 were proved to have been purchased by the plaintiffs on the basis of a invoice/voucher dated 22.8.2008 and the said fact pointed to the possession of the suit flat by the plaintiffs and, in fact, demolished the case of the defendants that the first plaintiff and the deceased had separated some time in the middle of the calendar year 2009. The passports issued to the plaintiffs in 2009 recording the address of the suit flat; the HDFC bank statement of plaintiff No. 1; the ICICI bank Credit Card Statement of plaintiff No. 1 during the relevant time, all indicating the address of the suit flat were duly relied upon by the Appellate Court in coming to its conclusion. The Appellate Court also relied on an application form submitted (before the Appellate Court) by the second plaintiff on 11.8.2011 for admission in the 11th standard in H.R. College of Commerce and Economics at Dinshaw Vachcha Road, Church Gate, Mumbai which was signed by the deceased Ibrahim Khan himself giving the address of the suit office and the suit flat. The version of the plaintiffs that the visiting card showing her office at Ashoka Centre was a forged document and also the claim that the plaintiff had used the said premises temporarily as the suit office was under renovation was accepted by the learned Appellate Court as sufficient explanation to counter the stand taken by the defendants. On the aforesaid basis the order of the learned Trial Judge was found fit for reversal and refusal of interim relief to the plaintiffs was held to be unjustified. Accordingly, interim relief(s) was granted in the appeal.

11. We have heard Mr. V. Krishnamurthy, Senior Advocate for the appellants and Mr. Shyam Divan, Senior Advocate for respondents No. 1 and

2.

12. A proceeding under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is intended to be a summary proceeding the object of which is to afford an immediate remedy to an aggrieved party to reclaim possession of which he may have been unjustly denied by an illegal act of dispossession. Questions of title or better rights of possession does not arise for adjudication in a suit under Section 6 where the only issue required to be decided is as to whether the plaintiff was in possession at any time six months prior to the date of filing of the suit. The legislative concern underlying Section 6 of the SR Act is to provide a quick remedy in cases of illegal dispossession so as to discourage litigants from seeking remedies outside the arena of law. The same is evident from the provisions of Section 6(3) which bars the remedy of an appeal or even a review against a decree passed in such a suit.

13. While the bar under Section 6(3) of the SR Act may not apply to the instant case in view of the initial forum in which the suit was filed and the appeal arising from the interim order being under the Letters Patent issued to the Bombay High Court, as held by a Constitution Bench of this Court P.S. Sathappan (Dead) by Lrs. v. Andhra Bank Ltd. & Ors.[1], what is ironical is that the correctness of the order passed in respect of the interim entitlement of the parties has reached this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. Ordinarily and in the normal course, by this time, the suit itself should have been disposed of. Tragically, the logical conclusion to the suit is no where in sight and it is on account of the proverbial delays that have plagued the system that interim matters are being contested to the last court with the greatest of vehemence and fervour. Given the ground realities of the situation it is neither feasible nor practical to take the view that interim matters, even though they may be inextricably connected with the merits of the main suit, should always be answered by maintaining a strict neutrality, namely, by a refusal to adjudicate. Such a stance by the courts is neither feasible nor practicable. Courts, therefore, will have to venture to decide interim matters on consideration of issues that are best left for adjudication in the full trial of the suit. In view of the inherent risk in performing such an exercise which is bound to become delicate in most cases the principles that the courts must follow in this regard are required to be stated in some detail though it must be made clear that such principles cannot be entrapped within any straitjacket formula or any precise laid down norms. Courts must endeavour to find out if interim relief can be granted on consideration of issues other than those involved in the main suit and also whether partial interim relief would satisfy the ends of justice till final disposal of the matter. The consequences of grant of injunction on the defendant if the plaintiff is to lose the suit alongwith the consequences on the plaintiff where injunction is refused but eventually the suit is decreed has to be carefully weighed and balanced by the Court in every given case. Interim reliefs which amount to pre-trial decrees must be avoided wherever possible. Though experience has shown that observations and clarifications to the effect that the findings recorded are prima facie and tentative, meant or intended only for deciding the interim entitlement of the parties have not worked well and interim findings on issues concerning the main suit has had a telling effect in the process of final adjudication it is here that strict exercise of judicial discipline will be of considerable help and assistance. The power of self-correction and comprehension of the orders of superior forums in the proper perspective will go a long way in resolving the dangers inherent in deciding an interim matter on issues that may have a close connection with those arising in the main suit.

14. There is yet another dimension to the issues arising in the present appeal. The interim relief granted to the plaintiffs by the Appellate Bench of the High Court in the present case is a mandatory direction to handover possession to the plaintiffs. Grant of mandatory interim relief requires the highest degree of satisfaction of the Court; much higher than a case involving grant of prohibitory injunction. It is, indeed, a rare power, the governing principles whereof would hardly require a reiteration inasmuch as the same which had been evolved by this Court in Dorab Cawasji Warden vs. Coomi Sorab Warden and Others[2] has come to be firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Paras 16 and 17 of the judgment in Dorab Cawasji Warden (supra), extracted below, may be usefully remembered in this regard:

“16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are:
(1) The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it shall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally required for a prohibitory injunction. (2) It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which normally cannot be compensated in terms of money.
(3) The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking such relief.
17. Being essentially an equitable relief the grant or refusal of an interlocutory mandatory injunction shall ultimately rest in the sound judicial discretion of the court to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances in each case. Though the above guidelines are neither exhaustive nor complete or absolute rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances needing action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or refusal of such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial discretion.”
15. In a situation where the learned Trial Court on a consideration of the respective cases of the parties and the documents laid before it was of the view that the entitlement of the plaintiffs to an order of interim mandatory injunction was in serious doubt, the Appellate Court could not have interfered with the exercise of discretion by the learned Trial Judge unless such exercise was found to be palpably incorrect or untenable. The reasons that weighed with the learned Trial Judge, as already noticed, according to us, do not indicate that the view taken is not a possible view. The Appellate Court, therefore, should not have substituted its views in the matter merely on the ground that in its opinion the facts of the case call for a different conclusion. Such an exercise is not the correct parameter for exercise of jurisdiction while hearing an appeal against a discretionary order. While we must not be understood to have said that the Appellate Court was wrong in its conclusions what is sought to be emphasized is that as long as the view of the Trial Court was a possible view the Appellate Court should not have interfered with the same following the virtually settled principles of law in this regard as laid down by this Court in Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P) Ltd.[3] Para 14 of the aforesaid judgment which is extracted below would amply sum up the situation:

“14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion. After referring to these principles Gajendragadkar, J. in Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph: (SCR 721) “... These principles are well established, but as has been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles Osenton & Co. v. Jhanaton ‘...the law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well settled principles in an individual case’.” The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this principle.”
16. Though the above discussions would lead us to the conclusion that the learned Appellate Bench of the High Court was not correct in interfering with the order passed by the learned Trial Judge we wish to make it clear that our aforesaid conclusion is not an expression of our opinion on the merits of the controversy between the parties. Our disagreement with the view of the Division Bench is purely on the ground that the manner of exercise of the appellate power is not consistent with the law laid down by this Court in the case of Wander Ltd. (supra). Accordingly, we set aside the order dated 09.10.2012 passed by the Appellate Bench of the Bombay High Court and while restoring the order dated 13.04.2012 of the learned Trial Judge we request the learned Trial Judge, or such other court to which the case may, in the mean time, have been transferred to dispose of the main suit as expeditiously as its calendar would permit with the expectation that the same will be possible within a period of six months from the date of receipt of this order. The appeal shall stand disposed of in terms of the above.",0
 State of Haryana & Ors,"Calling in question the legal acceptability and propriety of the judgment and order dated 08.05.2003 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.W.P. No. 16336 of 2002 whereby the Division Bench has quashed the order dated 26.9.2002 passed by the Sales Tax Tribunal, Haryana which had affirmed the orders passed by the appellate authority, namely, Joint Excise and Taxation and that of the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner (Gurgaon), the original authority who had, upon initiation of a proceeding under Rule 28 (11) (b) of the Haryana General Sales Tax Rules, 1975 (for short “the Rules”), come to hold that the respondent-assessee herein had violated the provisions of Rule 28A (11) (a) (i) as it had failed to maintain, without convincing reasons, the requisite production and was, therefore, liable to make full payment of tax exemption benefit availed by it during the concessional period, i.e., 13.12.1991 to 12.12.1998 of sale of Electronic Push Button Telephones (EPBT), the present appeal, by special leave, has been preferred by the State of Haryana and its functionaries.

2. The facts that are imperative to be stated are that the respondent assessee, namely, M/s. Bharti Teletech Limited, was allowed sales tax exemption under Rule 28A of the Rules for the period 13.12.1991 to 12.12.1998 for an amount of Rs.498.80 lakhs. This benefit was granted subject to the conditions laid down in the said sub-rule 11 of Rule 28A of the Rules. The conditions postulated in sub-rule 11 (a) are that the industrial unit after availing of the benefit shall continue its production at least for the next five years not below the level of average production for the preceding five years. There is also stipulation in the sub-rule 11 that if the unit violates any of the conditions laid down in clause

(a) of sub-rule 11, it shall be liable to make, in addition to the full amount of tax benefit availed of by it during the period of exemption, payment of interest chargeable under the Act as if no tax exemption was ever available to it. It is apt to note that there is a proviso that provides that the rigors of the said clause would not come into play if the loss of production is explained to the satisfaction of the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner concerned as being due to reasons beyond the control of the unit.

3. As the facts would uncurtain, on 3.05.1997, the assessee submitted an application seeking amendment in the eligibility certificate so as to include certain other items but it was rejected vide order dated 22.7.1997 by the High Level Screening Committee. On an appeal being filed, the Commissioner of Industries accepted the same and remitted the matter to the High Level Screening Committee to revise the eligibility certificate allowing the benefit of sales tax exemption by inclusion of additional items. However, the period of exemption remained unaltered. Be it noted, the assessee was granted the full benefit of exemption for the entire period.

4. After the expiry of the period of exemption, the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner (Gurgaon), the 2nd appellant herein, while monitoring the production level of the respondent unit, noticed that it was not maintaining the level of production of the preceding five years and, accordingly, initiated a proceeding against it on the foundation that it had violated the conditions enumerated under Rule 28A (11) (a) (i) and was thereby liable to make full payment of tax exemption benefit already availed by it along with interest. As required under the Rules, it issued a notice to show cause to explain non-maintenance of average production after the expiry of the benefit period inasmuch as it had drastically come down to Rs.9.06 crores from 17.52 crores. In the course of adjudication, in reply to the show cause, the assessee explained that it had established another unit as an expansion unit which had come into commercial production w.e.f. 27.3.1998 and for the purpose of determining the level of production after 12.12.1998, the production figures of the expansion unit were also required to be taken into account. A contention was raised before the 2nd appellant that the notice to show cause was premature as it was given prior to the expiry of twelve months from 12.12.1998, that is, the date on which the period of benefit expired.

5. The adjudicating authority rejected the said contention and proceeded to delve into the facts that had emerged before it. It came to hold that the Gross Turn Over (GTO) during January 1999 and December 1999 was Rs.9.06 crores as against the average GTO of Rs.17.52 crores during the five years immediately preceding 12.12.1998. The said authority also considered the GTO for the assessment year 1999-2000 (1.4.1999 to 31.3.2000) which reflected the amount as Rs.4,48,05,695.00 for the year immediately preceding, i.e., assessment year 1998-1999.

6. It may be noted that a contention was advanced that the unit during the five years preceding 12.12.1998 had produced 40,83,246 pieces giving yearly average of 8,16,649 pieces against which the average production in the post benefit period is 1898961 pieces which would show that the production actually increased after the expiry of the benefit period. The competent authority, upon perusal of the production chart for the period 13.12.1993 to 12.12.1998, analysed the same and arrived at the average production. The tabular chart prepared by the adjudicating authority is as follows:-

|Average Production                                                  |
|Items       |Before on period|Expiry  |After Expiry of |Increase   |
|            |                |benefit |benefit period  |(+)        |
|            |                |        |                |Decrease   |
|            |                |        |                |(-)        |
|ETBT        |330431          |        |163270          |(-)  167161|
|Pagers      |    4405        |        |Nil             |(-)        |
|            |                |        |                |4405       |
|Spare Parts |481813          |        |1735691         |(+) 1253878|



7. The reasoning adopted by the 2nd appellant basically was that the claim of the assessee that production had not come down in the post benefit period was wholly unacceptable because it could not be given the same weightage as its individual parts inasmuch as a complete telephone set could not, for the exemption purpose, be equated with its number of parts which constituted its assembly. Being of this view, the 2nd appellant came to hold that it was obligatory on the part of the assessee industrial unit, having availed the benefit of tax exemption for the specified period, to continue its business and to respect the conditions enumerated in the prescription in the rule. The said authority ruled that the assessee, having failed to meet the production level, was liable to be visited with the consequences and, accordingly, directed for making full payment along with interest.

8. Grieved by the aforesaid order, the assessee preferred an appeal before the appellate authority who came to hold that the explanation for loss in production was due to outdated machinery and, hence, the reasons for fall in production could not be held to be beyond the control of the assessee, for it was well within his control to replace the outdated machinery of the old unit instead of putting up a new unit. On the aforesaid bedrock, the appellate authority declined to interfere in appeal.

9. Failure in appeal led the assessee to file an appeal before the Sales Tax Tribunal which, on reappreciation of the factual matrix in entirety, came to hold that the average manufacturing of EPBT in the subsequent three years was approximately of 9.32 lacs as against an average of 3.79 in the preceding five years. That apart, the appellant had not taken the plea that the lower production was because of factors beyond their control. The tribunal further observed that it was not a mere coincidence that the second unit (expansion) became operational soon after the expiry of benefit in the first unit from which it was evident that the assessee had a well thought out plan to deliberately reduce the manufacturing of EPBT drastically in the first unit and increase the production of the said item in the second unit. The tribunal also took note of the fact from the information provided by the assessee it was obvious that the turnover in the expanded unit had increased from Rs.65.49 lacs in 1998- 1999 to Rs.31.36 crores in 1999 but on the other hand, the turnover in the first unit had gone down from Rs.13.27 crore during 1998-99 to Rs.4.48 crore during 1999-2000 and hence, it was clearly indicative that the expanded capacity had been created to coincide with the expiry of the benefit period in the first unit. Finally, the tribunal held:-

“Though increase or decrease in the turnover by itself may not be of much consequence in the scheme but the turnover does have direct relationship with the production and since the production of higher value item i.e. EPBT was reduced, the total gross turnover in terms of value was also bound to decline and the spare capacity in the first unit was utilized by increasing the production of spare parts i.e. low value items. It is, therefore, obvious from the facts of the case that the production of EPBT was deliberately reduced in the first unit and increased in the second unit as the appellant company was hoped of getting the benefit of exemption again on the expanded capacity.”
10. In view of the aforesaid analysis, the tribunal affirmed the conclusion recorded by the forums below. The aforesaid order of the tribunal came to be assailed before the High Court in a writ petition. The Division Bench of the High Court referred to the rule position and quantity manufactured in lacs and turnover of goods and placed reliance on R.K. Mittal Woolen Mills v. State of Haryana and others[1] and came to hold that the tribunal ought to have set aside the orders of the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner and Joint Excise and Taxation Commissioner instead of upholding their action on totally erroneous consideration. It opined that the approach of the tribunal was erroneous inasmuch as without pointing out to the violation of the rules, it had passed the order solely on the basis of conjecture. The High Court further observed that even if the factum of reduction of production as stated by the tribunal was accepted as correct, still the exemption on tax could not have been withdrawn as it was not a ground mentioned in sub-rule II (a) (i) of Rule 28A for withdrawal of exemption.

11. Questioning the defensibility of the order passed by the High Court, Mr. Manjit Singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, has contended that the High Court in a laconic manner has arrived at the conclusion that the authorities as well as the tribunal has fallen into error by opining that there has been a violation of the rule in question though on a bare reading of the said orders there can be no shadow of doubt that the increased production in respect of the second unit could not have been taken into account for the first unit since the second unit was an individual unit having no concern with the first unit. It is his further submission that the High Court failed to appreciate that the respondent had tried to take recourse to an innovative subterfuge by establishing a new unit producing the same items as the earlier ones and added the production of the second unit to the first unit to claim the benefit which is impermissible. Learned counsel would further submit that when the conditions enumerated under the rule had factually been violated, there was no justification on the part of the High Court to opine on the basis of the decision rendered in the R.K. Mittal Woolen Mills’ case that the exemption could not have been withdrawn because there had been no violation of clauses (I) and (II) of sub-rule 11(a) of Rule 28A of the Rules.

12. Mr. Gopal Jain, learned counsel appearing for the respondent contended, in support of the impugned order, that the appreciation of facts by the High Court and the reasons ascribed by it for annulling the orders of the forums below are absolutely unimpeachable since the assessee was under an obligation to apply for exemption even in respect of expansion and in that background, there was no justification for the forums below not to take into consideration the production of the expanded unit. It is also urged by him that even assuming that there are two units, the same would be covered under the definition of Rule 28A (f) which defines “eligible industrial unit” and on a proper construction of the provision, the combined conclusion of the production of the units cannot really be found fault with. It is also put forth by him that the provisions relating to exemption and the exemption notifications are required to be liberally construed for industrial growth and the High Court, keeping in mind the said principle, has dislodged the orders passed by the forums below and, therefore, the order impugned should not be taken exception to.

13. To appreciate the rivalised contention raised at the bar, it is appropriate to refer to Rule 28A (11) which reads as follows:-

“11(a) The benefit of tax-exemption/deferment under this rule shall be subject to the condition that the beneficiary/industrial unit after having availed of the benefit,

-

(i) shall continue its production at least for the next five years not below the level of average production for the preceding five year; and
(ii) shall not make sales outside the State for next five years by way of transfer or consignment of goods manufactured by it.
(b) In case the unit violates any of the conditions laid down in clause (a), it shall be liable to make, in addition to the full amount of tax-benefit availed of by it during the period of exemption/deferment, payment of interest chargeable under the Act as if no tax exemption/ deferment was ever available to it;

PROVIDED that the provisions of this clause shall not come into play if the loss in production is explained to the satisfaction of the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner concerned as being due to the reasons beyond the control of the units:

PROVIDED FURTHER that a unit shall not be called upon to pay any sum under this clause without having been given reasonable opportunity of being heard.” [Emphasis added]

14. On a bare reading of the said Rule, it is evincible that the conditions which are imposed have been enumerated in clause I (ii) of the said sub-rule 11 (a) of Rule 28A to the effect that in the event of non-maintenance of the quality of production after the expiry of the exemption, the assessee has to pay the tax benefit availed with interest. In the case at hand, the revenue has pressed clause I (ii) into service. The Division Bench has relied on the decision in R.K. Mittal Woolen Mills (supra) wherein the High Court was dealing with the withdrawal of eligibility of certificate as provided in sub-rules 8 and 9 of Rule 28A. After referring to sub-rule 8 of Rule 28A that deals with the withdrawal of eligibility certificate under certain circumstances. Analysing the said Rule, it was stated thus :-

“A perusal of the aforesaid sub-rule would show that the grounds on which the eligibility certificate and be withdrawn are mentioned therein but the ground of non-production of the change of land use permission from the Town and Country Planning Department is not one of the grounds mentioned therein. Sub- rule (8) of Rule 28A being a part of a taxing statute has, in the nature of things, to be construed very strictly and, therefore, the eligibility certificate can be withdrawn only on the grounds mentioned therein and on no other grounds. The authorities cannot add any other ground to the said sub-rule. We are, therefore, satisfied that the eligibility certificate granted to the petitioner could not be withdrawn only on the ground of non-production of the change of land use permission by the Town and Country Planning Department”
15. The said decision, as we perceive, was rendered in a totally different context. In the present case, we are not concerned with the withdrawal of eligibility certificate. We are concerned with the consequences that have been enumerated in clause (b) of sub- rule 11 of Rule 28A which clearly stipulates that in case of violation of clause 11 (a) (i) of Rule 11, the assessee shall be liable for making, in addition to the full amount of tax-benefit availed of by it during the period of exemption/deferment, with interest chargeable under the Act. Thus, reliance placed by the High Court on the said decision is misconceived and inappropriate.

16. The hub of the matter is whether production of two different units can be combined together to meet the requirement of the postulate enshrined under the Rule. The production of the beneficiary unit had failed to fulfil the stipulation incorporated in sub-rule 11 (a)(i) of Rule 28A of the Rules. It is also the undisputed position that the production of the expanded unit has been computed and clubbed with the first unit to reflect the meeting of the criterion. The competent authority has come to a definite conclusion that the expanded capacity had been created to show that the rate of production is maintained but it is fundamentally a subterfuge. The authority has also taken into consideration the different items produced and how there has been loss of production of EPBT in the first unit. The High Court has failed to appreciate the relevant facts and, without noticing that the respondent-assessee had clubbed the production of the units, lancinated the orders passed by the forums below.

17. Mr. Jain, learned counsel for the respondent has drawn our attention to clause (f) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 28A which defines ‘eligible industrial unit’. The definition reads as follows:-

“(f) 'eligible industrial unit' means:-
(i) a new industrial unit or expansion or diversification of the existing unit, which-
(I) has obtained certificate of registration under the Act;
(II) is not a public sector undertaking where the Central Government held 51 per cent or more shares;
(III) is not availing incentive of interest free loan from the Industries Department for investment after the 1st day of April, 1988;
(IV) is not included in Schedule III appended to these rules except the tiny units set up in a rural area on or after 1-4-1992, in which capital investment in plant and machinery including market price of plant and machinery taken on base or otherwise, does not exceed rupees five lakhs, shall not form part of Schedule III;
(V) is not availing or has availed of exemption under Section 13 of the Act;
(ii) a sick industrial unit recommended by the High Powered Committee for the grant of fiscal relief either in the form of exemption from the payment of sales tax or purchase tax or both or deferment of tax.”
18. He has laid immense emphasis on the term ‘expansion’ of the existing unit. The term ‘expansion’ has been defined in clause

(d) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 28A which reads thus:-

(d) ""expansion/diversification of industrial unit"" means a capacity set up or installed during the operative period which creates additional productions/manufacturing facilities for manufacture of the same product/products as of the existing unit (expansion) or different products (diversification) at the same or new location -

(i) in which the additional fixed -capital investment made during the operative period exceeds 25% of the fixed capital investment of the existing unit, and

(ii) which results into increase in annual production by 25% of the installed capacity of the Existing Unit in case of expansion.

On a careful reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is quite clear as day that they deal with the eligibility to get the benefit of exemption/deferment from the payment of tax. On a studied scrutiny of clause (f) (i) (I), it is manifest that it is incumbent on the unit to obtain certificate of registration under the Act. The submission of Mr. Jain is that the second unit has obtained the registration certificate under the Act and, hence, the production of the said unit, being eligible, is permitted to be included. Needless to say, obtainment of registration certificate is a condition precedent to become eligible but that does not mean that the production of the said unit will be taken into account for sustaining the benefit of the first unit. They are independent of each other as far as sub-rule 11 of the Rule 28A is concerned. We are disposed to think so as the grant of exemption has a sacrosanct purpose. The concept of exemption has been introduced for development of industrial activity and it is granted for a certain purpose to a unit for certain types of good. Exemption can be granted under the Rules or under a notification with certain conditions and also ensure payment of taxes post the exemption period. The concept of exemption is required to be tested on a different anvil, for it grants freedom from liability. In the case at hand, as we understand, it is ‘unit’ specific. The term ‘unit’ has not been defined. The grant of exemption unit wise can be best understood by way of example. An entrepreneur can get an exemption of a unit and thereafter establish number of units and try to club together the production of all of them to get the benefit for all. It would be well nigh unacceptable, for what is required is that each unit must meet the condition to avail the benefit.

19. We will be failing in our duty if we do not address to a submission, albeit the last straw, of Mr. Jain that any provision relating to grant of exemption, be it under a rule or notification, should be considered liberally. In this regard, we may profitably refer to the decision in Hansraj Gordhanadas v. H.H. Dave, Assistant Collector of Central Excise and Customs, Surat and others[2] wherein it has been held as follows:-

“...It is well established that in a taxing statute there is no room for any intendment but regard must be had to the clear meaning of the words. The entire matter is governed wholly by the language of the notification. If the tax-payer is within the plain terms of the exemption it cannot be denied its benefit by calling in aid any supposed intention of the exempting authority. If such intention can be gathered from the construction of the words of the notification or by necessary implication therefrom, the matter is different...”

20. In Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Industrial Coal Enterprises[3], after referring to CIT v. Straw Board Mfg. Co. Ltd[4] and Bajaj Tempo Ltd. v. CIT[5], the Court ruled that an exemption notification, as is well known, should be construed liberally once it is found that the entrepreneur fulfills all the eligibility criteria. In reading an exemption notification, no condition should be read into it when there is none. If an entrepreneur is entitled to the benefit thereof, the same should not be denied.

21. In this context, reference to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and Another v. Status Spinning Mills Limited and another[6] would be fruitful. It has been held therein :-

“It may be true that the exemption notification should receive a strict construction as has been held by this Court in Novopan India Ltd. v. CCE and Customs[7], but it is also true that once it is found that the industry is entitled to the benefit of exemption notification, it would received a broad construction. (See Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand[8] and A.P. Steel Re-Rolling Mill Ltd. v. State of Kerala[9]). A notification granting exemption can be withdrawn in public interest. What would be the public interest would, however, depend upon the facts of each case.”

22. From the aforesaid authorities, it is clear as crystal that a statutory rule or an exemption notification which confers benefit to the assessee on certain conditions should be liberally construed but the beneficiary should fall within the ambit of the rule or notification and further if there are conditions and violation thereof are provided, then the concept of liberal construction would not arise. Exemption being an exception has to be respected regard being had to its nature and purpose. There can be cases where liberal interpretation or understanding would be permissible, but in the present case, the rule position being clear, the same does not arise.

23. At this juncture, it is apposite to refer to the pronouncement in State of Haryana and others v. A.S. Fuels Private Limited and another[10]. In the said case, the State of Haryana had approached this Court as the High Court had construed the effect of sub-rule 10 (v) of Rule 28A of the Rules which authorises the department to withdraw the tax exemption certificate but had granted liberty to the State to scrutinize if it was a case for withdrawal of the eligibility certificate under sub-rule (8) of Rule 28A of the Rules and, thereafter, to proceed in accordance with the law. This Court, scanning the anatomy of Rule 28A, opined that under sub-rule (8)(b), when the eligibility certificate is withdrawn, the exemption/entitlement certificate is also deemed to have been withdrawn from the first day of its validity and the unit shall be liable to payment of tax, interest or penalty under the Act as if no entitlement certificate had ever been granted to it. Thereafter, the Court adverted to sub-rule 11 (a) and, in that context, it observed thus:-

“...there are several conditions which are relevant; firstly, there is a requirement of continuing the production for at least next five years; secondly, consequences flowing in case of violation of the conditions laid down in clause (a). In other words, in case of non continuance of production for next five years, the result is that it shall be deemed as if there was no tax exemption/entitlement available to it. The proviso permits to the dealers to explain satisfactorily to the DETC that the loss in production was because of the reasons beyond the control of the unit. The materials have to be placed in this regard by the party. The High Court seems to have completely lost sight of sub-rule (11)(b).”
24. In the case at hand, as we have already held, clubbing is not permissible. It amounts to a violation of the conditions stipulated under Rule 11(a)(i) of Rule 28A and, therefore, the consequences have to follow and as a result, the assessee has to pay the full amount of tax benefit and interest. The approach of the High Court is absolutely erroneous and it really cannot withstand close scrutiny.

25. In view of our aforesaid analysis and prismatic reasoning, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside and those of the tribunal and other authorities are restored. There shall be no order as to costs.",1
"Occupational Health and
Safety Association","The Petitioner, a non-profit occupational health and safety organization, registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, has invoked the extra-ordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking the following reliefs :-

a. To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order, or direction directing the Respondents to frame guidelines with respect to occupational safety and health regulations to be maintained by various industries;
b. To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction directing respondents to appoint and constitute a committee for the monitoring of the working of thermal power plants in India and to keep check on the health and safety norms for the workers working in their power stations;
c. To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction directing the respondents to pay compensation to the workers who are victims of occupational health disorders and to frame a scheme of compensation for workers in cases of occupational health disorders;
d. To issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction directing the respondents to notify the recommendations as contained in paragraph 35 of the Petition as guidelines to be followed by thermal power plant.
2. The Petitioner represents about 130 Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants (CFTPPs) in India spread over different States in the country, but no proper occupational health services with adequate facilities for health delivery system or guidelines with respect to occupational safety are in place. Factories Act, Boilers Act, Employees’ State Insurance Act, Compensation Act, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Environmental Protection Act, etc. are in place, but the lack of proper health delivery system, evaluation of occupational health status of workers, their safety and protection cause serious occupational health hazards.

3. The Petitioner herein filed I.A. No.1 of 2005 and 2 of 2007 and highlighted the serious diseases, the workers working in thermal plants are suffering from over a period of years. The Report produced by the Petitioner would indicate that half of the workers have lung function abnormalities, pulmonary function test abnormalities, senor neuro loss, skin diseases, asthama, and so on. This Court noticing the same, passed an interim order on 30.1.2008, after taking note of the various suggestions made at the Bar to reduce the occupational hazards of the employees working in various thermal power stations in the country. Following are the main suggestions put forward before this Court :

1. Comprehensive medical checkup of all workers in all coal fired thermal power stations by doctors appointed in consultation with the trade unions. First medical check up to be completed within six months. Then to be done on yearly basis.
2. Free and comprehensive medical treatment to be provided to all workers found to be suffering from an occupational disease, ailment or accident, until cured or until death.
3. Services of the workmen not to be terminated during illness and to be treated as if on duty.
4. Compensation to be paid to workmen suffering from any occupational disease, aliment or accident in accordance with the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923.
5. Modern protective equipment to be provided to workmen as recommended by an expert body in consultation with the trade unions.
6. Strict control measures to be immediately adopted for the control of dust, heat, noise, vibration and radiation to be recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) Ahmadabad, Gujarat.
7. All employees to abide by the Code of Practice on Occupational Safety and Health Audit as developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards.
8. Safe methods be followed for the handling, collection and disposal of hazardous waste to be recommended by NIOH.
9. Appointment of a Committee of experts by NIOH including therein Trade Union representatives and Health and Safety NGO’s to look into the issue of Health and Safety of workers and make recommendations.
4. Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General, submitted that the suggestions no.1 to 7 have been accepted by the Central Government stating that they are broadly covered in various existing enactments and consequently pro-occupational action would be taken for effective implementation of the relevant laws, in particular, areas covered by those suggestions. After recording the above submissions, this Court had also directed the Ministry of Labour to take steps to see that those suggestions and relevant provisions of the various Labour Acts are properly implemented to protect the welfare of the employees. Learned ASG also submitted before the Court that the Central Government would examine whether the remaining two suggestions i.e. suggestion nos.8 and 9 could be implemented and, if so, to what extent.

5. The Writ Petition again came up for hearing before this Court on 6.9.2010 and this Court passed the following order:

“Vide order dated January 30, 2008, Respondent No.1 had agreed to Guideline Nos.1 to 7.
However, time was taken to consider Guidelines Nos.8 and 9, which primarily dealt with the appointment of Committee of Experts by NIOH. The constitution of that Committee is also spelt out in Guideline No.9. Today, when the matter came up for hearing before this Court, learned Solicitor General stated that the Committee of Experts has been duly constituted by NIOH and it will submit its status report on the next occasion.
The writ petition shall stand over for eight weeks.”
6. The Government of India later placed a Report of the Committee prepared by the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) titled Environment, Health and Safety Issues in Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants of the year 2011.

7. Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel, referring to the above- mentioned Report, submitted that the Union of India as also the Committee have misunderstood the scope of the suggestion nos.8 and 9. Learned senior counsel submitted that not much importance was given to the serious health problems being faced by the workers who are working in the thermal power plants and the treatment they require as well as the payment of wages and compensation to those workers who are suffering from serious illness. Learned senior counsel pointed out that some urgent steps should be taken to ensure the health and safety of the workers, through comprehensive and timely medical examinations, follow-up treatment as well as to provide compensation for the serious occupational diseases they are suffering from. Even these vital aspects, according to the learned senior counsel, have been completely overlooked by the Committee.

8. Learned ASG submitted that the Report of the NIOH is comprehensive and all relevant aspects have been taken care of and that there are several laws to protect the health and safety of the workers who are working in the various thermal power stations in the country. Learned ASG also submitted that the Committee has recommended the need of occupational health services with adequate facilities for health delivery system and that all power generating authorities must have well defined sector-specific occupational health safety and environmental management framework. Learned ASG also submitted that the Report would be implemented in its true letter and spirit.

9. This Court in Consumer Education & Research Centre and others v. Union of India and others (1995) 3 SCC 42, has held that the right to health and medical care to protect one’s health and vigour, while in service or post-retirement, is a fundamental right of a worker under Article 21 read with Articles 39(e), 41, 43, 48-A and all related Articles and fundamental human rights to make the life of the workman meaningful and purposeful with dignity of person. The Court held that the compelling necessity to work in an industry exposed to health hazards due to indigence to bread-winning for himself and his dependents should not be at the cost of health and vigour of the workman.

10. Right to health i.e. right to live in a clean, hygienic and safe environment is a right flowing from Article 21. Clean surroundings lead to healthy body and healthy mind. But, unfortunately, for eking a livelihood and for national interest, many employees work in dangerous, risky and unhygienic environment. Right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy, particularly clauses (e) and (f) of Articles 39, 41 and 42. Those Articles include protection of health and strength of workers and just and humane conditions of work. Those are minimum requirements which must exist to enable a person to live with human dignity. Every State has an obligation and duty to provide at least the minimum condition ensuring human dignity. But when workers are engaged in such hazardous and risky jobs, then the responsibility and duty on the State is double-fold. Occupational health and safety issues of CFTPPs are associated with thermal discharge, air and coal emission, fire hazards, explosion hazards etc. Dust emanates also contain free silica associated with silicosis, arsenic leading to skin and lung cancer, coal dust leading to black lung and the potential harmful substances. Necessity for constant supervision and to the drive to mitigate the harmful effects on the workers is of extreme importance.

11. India is one of the largest coal producing countries in the world and it has numerous CFTPPs requiring nearly 440 million tons of coal per year. We have about 130 CFTPPs in India. The thermal power plants generate about two-third of the electricity consumed in India, while 54.3% of the energy demand is met by coal fired power generation. The NIOH in its Report in 2011 has already made its recommendations with respect to the suggestions made by this Court in its order dated 30.1.2008. Since the Central Government has already accepted suggestions no.1 to 7, at the moment we are concerned with suggestions no.8 and 9, which we reiterate as follows :-

“8. Safe methods be followed for the handling, collection and disposal of hazardous waste to be recommended by NIOH.
9. Appointment of a Committee of experts by NIOH including therein Trade Union representatives and Health and Safety NGO’s to look into the issue of Health and Safety of workers and make recommendations.”
12. The Report in para 4.1.2 has referred to various health hazards and the same is reproduced hereinbelow :-

“4.1.2 General . Use of Hazardous Material for Insulation: Certain materials such as asbestos, glass wool etc. are used for insulation. These materials are highly dangerous to human health, if inhaled or if contacted with the eye/skin surface. While handling such materials, the PPE should be provided to the workers as well as proper disposal of waste asbestos and glass wool should be ensured. Nowadays, safer substitutes, such as p-aramid, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cellulose, polyacrylonitrile, glass fibres, graphite are available, the use of which may be explored.
. Compliance with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act and its amendments from time to time applicable for the power plants with respect to emission and discharge, ash utilization and hazardous waste management should be ensured to protect the ambient environment as well as maintain safe and healthy working conditions for the workers. . The generated fly ash need to be utilized as per the CPCB annual implementation report on fly ash utilization (2009-10) that 100% utilization to be achieved by the power plants, within 5 years from the date of notification (refer to Table 17, page 48). For new CFTPPs, the fly ash utilization needs to be regulated as per the schedule given in Table 17.
. It is desirable that the coal handling facilities are mechanized and automated to the extent possible.
. Occupational health services should be provided for wide range benefit to the workers. Broadly, it should contain the facilities for occupational health delivery system with trained manpower and infrastructure including investigational facilities, environmental assessment, evaluation of occupational health status and first aid training of the workers on regular basis. These services should be independent and separate from hospital services (curative service) but should function in liaison with the curative service.
. Periodic awareness programmes regarding the health and safety with active involvement of the workers should be organized, covering each individual with the minimum annual average duration of 8 hours per worker. Regular community level awareness programmes may be organized in the vicinity of the plant for the family members of the workers. . Periodic medical examination (PME), as required under the Factories Act should be undertaken. However, the investigations performed under the PME should be relevant to the job exposures. Since coal/ash handling workers are prone to dust exposure related diseases, due attention is required to those workers. In case of need, the frequency of PME may be scheduled, based on observation of the health check-up information. Providing PPE and re-locating of job for those workers may also be considered. . As per recommendations of the Factories Act, the workers need to be examined radiologically (chest X-ray) on yearly basis. However, in order to avoid unnecessary exposure of the human body to the radiation, the regular yearly chest X-ray is not recommended, unless urgent and essential. Considering the latency period of development of pneumoconiosis, it is recommended to undergo chest X-ray every two years for initial 10 years and based on the progression, re-scheduling may be adopted. After 10 years it should be done on yearly basis or earlier depending on the development and/or progression of the disease.
. Health records should be maintained in easily retrievable manner, preferably in electronic form. The provision should be made to recall the worker, as and when his or her check up is due. Pre-placement medical examination and proper documentation of records should be mandatory.
. A comprehensive document on environment, health and safety specific to coal based thermal power projects should be framed. It should cover the legal provisions, management system, best practices, safe operating procedures, etc. for various areas of thermal power plants. This will serve as a reference document for effective implementation of the provisions. . All CFTPPs should have environmental and occupational health and safety management systems in place, which are auditable by third party, approved by the Govt of India (Ministry of Power). Participatory management regarding health and safety at plant level may be ensured.
. The occupier of the CFTPP shall be responsible for the compliance of provisions of the Factories’ Act for casual/contractual labour on health and safety issues. In case of women workers, the provisions of the Factories’ Act, as applicable, shall be given attention.
13. Para 3.1.2 of the Report specifically refers to the occupational health and safety issues of workers in CFTPPs. The Report also refers to the hazards associated with (a) dust, (b) heat, (c) noise, (d) vibration,

(e) radiation, and (f) disposal of waste. After dealing with those health hazards, the Committee has stated that the hazards associated with inhalation of coal dust might result in development of dust related morbidity in the form of pneumoconiosis (coal workers pneumoconiosis, silicosis) and non-pneumoconiotic persistent respiratory morbidities, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, etc. Further, it also pointed out that whenever asbestos fibres are used for insulation and other purposes, the possibility of asbestosis among workers due to inhalation of asbestos fibres cannot be ruled out. The Report also says that other morbidities because of exposure to fly ash, including metallic constituents such as lead, arsenic, and mercury might also be present. Due to exposure to other chemicals used in different operations of CFTPP, the Report says, may also be responsible to adversely affect human health.

14. Report further says that occupational exposure to high heat in different thermal power plants may also cause heat related disorders, like heat exhaustion. Noise and vibration exposures in higher doses than the permissible limits may result in noise-induced hearing loss, raised blood pressure, regional vascular disorders, musculo-skeletal disorders, human error, productivity loss, accidents and injuries. Radiation hazards particularly from the generated fly ash and its used products have also been indicated of possible health risks. Different chemicals that are often being used in CFTPPs, such as chlorine, ammonia, fuel oil, and released in the working and community environment may be responsible for wide range of acute as well as chronic health impairments. Since large quantities of coal, other fuels and chemicals are stored and used in CFTPPs, the risks of fire and explosion are high, unless special care is taken in handling the materials. It may cause fire and explosion. Further, it may also be pointed out that in various work operations for manual materials handling, the workers are subjected to high degree of physical stress, with potential risks of musculo-skeletal disorders and injuries.

15. In para 3.1.5 the Report suggests certain protective measures for health and safety and also steps to be taken for emergency preparedness on spot/off-spot emergency plans and also the measures to be adopted for social welfare.

16. We may notice, the recommendations made are to be welcomed, but how far they are put into practice and what preventive actions are taken to protect the workers from the serious health-hazards associated with the work in CFTPPs calls for serious attention. Many workers employed in various CFTPPs are reported to be suffering from serious diseases referred to earlier. What are the steps taken by CFTPPs and the Union of India and the statutory authorities to protect them from serious health hazards and also the medical treatment extended to them, including compensation etc. calls for detailed examination.

17. We notice that CFTPPs are spread over various States in the country like Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and so on, and it would not be practicable for this Court to examine whether CFTPPs are complying with safety standards and the rules and regulations relating to the health of the employees working in various CFTPPs throughout the country. We feel that these aspects could be better examined by the respective High Courts in whose jurisdiction these power plants are situated. The High Court should examine whether there is adequate and effective health delivery system in place and whether there is any evaluation of occupational health status of the workers. The High Court should also examine whether any effective medical treatment is meted out to them.

18. We, therefore, feel that it is appropriate to relegate it to the various High Courts to examine these issues with the assistance of the State Governments after calling for necessary Reports from the CFTPPs situated in their respective States. For the said purpose, we are sending a copy of this Judgment to the Chief Secretaries of the respective States as well as Registrar Generals of the High Courts of the following States :

a) Uttar Pradesh
b) Chhattisgarh
c) Maharashtra
d) Andhra Pradesh
e) West Bengal
f) Madhya Pradesh
g) Bihar
h) Orissa
i) Haryana
j) Rajasthan
k) Punjab
l) Delhi/NCT Delhi
m) Gujarat
n) Karnataka
o) Kerala
p) Tamil Nadu
q) Jharkhand
r) Assam
19. Report of National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH) titled Environment, Health and Safety Issues in Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants of the year 2011 may also be made available by the Secretary General of the Supreme Court to the Registrar Generals of the High Courts of the aforesaid States. We make it clear that the Report is not at all comprehensive in certain aspects and the respective High Courts can examine the issues projected in this Judgment independently after calling for the reports about the CFTPPs functioning in their respective States. The Registrar Generals of High Courts of the aforesaid States should place this Judgment before the Chief Justices of the respective States so as to initiate suo moto proceedings in the larger interest of the workers working in CFTPPs in the respective States.

20. The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of.",0
"MONTFORD BROTHERS OF
 ST. GABRIEL & ANR","The appellant No.1 is a charitable society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1960. It runs various institutions as a constituent unit of Catholic Church. It is running various orphanages, industrial schools and other social service activities besides number of educational schools/institutions. Its members after joining the appellant society renounce the world and are known as “Brother”. Such a `Brother’ severs his all relations with the natural family and is bound by the constitution of the society which includes Article 60 quoted in paragraph 3 of the order dated 10.12.2003 passed in Review Petition No.4 of 2002 and in annexure P.5 as such:

“Whatever the `Brother’ receives by way of salary, subsidies, gifts, pension or from insurance or other such benefits belongs to the community as by right and goes into the common purse.”
4. Appellant No.2 is Principal of St. Paul’s Higher Secondary School, Aizawal, Mizoram and represents appellant no.1 as well.

5. One `Brother’ of the Society, namely, Alex Chandy Thomas was a Director-cum-Head master of St. Peter High School and he died in a motor accident on 22.06.1992. The accident was between a Jeep driven by the deceased and a Maruti Gypsy covered by insurance policy issued by the respondent Insurance Company. At the time of death the deceased was aged 34 years and was drawing monthly salary of Rs.4,190/-. The claim petition bearing No.55 of 1992 was filed before M.A.C.T., Aizawal by appellant no.2 on being duly authorized by the appellant no.1-the society. The owner of the Gypsy vehicle discussed in his written statement that vehicle was duly insured and hence liability, if any, was upon the Insurance Company. The respondent-Insurance Company also filed a written statement and thereby raised various objections to the claim. But as is clear from the written statement under Annexure P.2 it never raised the issue that since the deceased was a `Brother’ and therefore without any family or heir, the appellant could not file claim petition for want of locus standi. The issue no.1 regarding maintainability of claim petition was not pressed by the respondents. The Tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.2,52,000/- in favour of the claimant and against the opposite parties with a direction to the insurer to deposit Rs.2,27,000/- with the Tribunal as Rs.25,000/- had already been deposited as interim compensation. The Tribunal also permitted interest at the rate of 12% per annum, but from the date of judgment dated 14.07.1994 passed in MACT case Nos. 55 and 82 of 1992.

6. Instead of preferring appeal against the order of the Tribunal, the respondent-Company preferred a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the Gauhati High Court and by the impugned order under appeal dated 20.08.2002, the High Court allowed the aforesaid writ petition (C) No.20 of 2002 ex-parte, and held the judgment and order of the learned Tribunal to be invalid and incompetent being in favour of person/persons who according to the High court were not competent to claim compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act. This was the only ground of challenge to the judgment and Award of the Tribunal. The High Court, however, did not disturb the Award of Rs.25,000/- already made as interim compensation. Review Petition preferred by the appellants was also rejected on 10.12.2003 but after noticing the relevant facts relating to locus of the appellants.

7. From the facts noted above, it is evident that there is no dispute between the parties with regard to the quantum of compensation determined by the Tribunal and the only issue is whether the High Court was correct in law in holding that the appellants are not competent to claim compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act for the accidental death of `Brother’ belonging to the appellant-society.

8. The only issue noted above requires to look into Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, (hereinafter referred to as `The Act’). Sub- section (1) of Section 166 is relevant for the purpose. It provides thus:

“166. Application for compensation:-(1) An application for compensation arising out of an accident of the nature specified in sub- section (1) of section 165 may be made—
(a) by the person who has sustained the injury; or
(b) by the owner of the property; or
(c) where death has resulted from the accident, by all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased; or
(d) by any agent duly authorised by the person inured or all or any of the legal representatives of the deceased, as the case may be:
Provided that where all the legal representatives of the deceased have not joined in any such application for compensation, the application shall be made on behalf of or for the benefit of all the legal representatives of the deceased and the legal representatives who have not so joined, shall be impleaded as respondents to the application. “
9. The Act does not define the term “legal representative” but the Tribunal has noted in its judgment and order that clause (C) of Rule 2 of the Mizoram Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Rules, 1988, defines the term `legal representative’ as having the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (11) of Section 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which is as follows:

“Section 2(11)`Legal representative’ means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves On the death of the party so suing or sued”.
10. From the aforesaid provisions it is clear that in case of death of a person in a motor vehicle accident, right is available to a legal representative of the deceased or the agent of the legal representative to lodge a claim for compensation under the provisions of the Act. The issue as to who is a legal representative or its agent is basically an issue of fact and may be decided one way or the other dependent upon the facts of a particular case. But as a legal proposition it is undeniable that a person claming to be a legal representative has the locus to maintain an application for compensation under Section 166 of the Act, either directly or through any agent, subject to result of a dispute raised by the other side on this issue.

11. Learned counsel for the Insurance Company tried to persuade us that since the term `legal representative’ has not been defined under the Act, the provision of Section 1-A of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, should be taken as guiding principle and the claim should be confined only for the benefit of wife, husband, parent and child, if any, of the person whose death has been caused by the accident. In this context, he cited judgment of this Court in the case of Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation, Ahmedabad vs. Raman Bhai Prabhatbhai & Anr.[1]. In that case, covered by the Motor Vehicles Act of 1939, the claimant was a brother of a deceased killed in a motor vehicle accident. The Court rejected the contention of the appellant that since the term `legal representative’ is not defined under the Motor Vehicles Act, the right of filing the claim should be controlled by the provisions of Fatal Accident Act. It was specifically held that Motor Vehicles Act creates new and enlarged right for filing an application for compensation and such right cannot be hedged in by the limitations on an action under the Fatal Accidents Act. Paragraph 11 of the report reflects the correct philosophy which should guide the courts interpreting legal provisions of beneficial legislations providing for compensation to those who had suffered loss.

“11. We feel that the view taken by the Gujarat High Court is in consonance with the principles of justice, equity and good conscience having regard to the conditions of the Indian society. Every legal representative who suffers on account of the death of a person due to a motor vehicle accident should have a remedy for realisation of compensation and that is provided by Sections 110-A to 110-F of the Act. These provisions are in consonance with the principles of law of torts that every injury must have a remedy. It is for the Motor Vehicles Accidents Tribunal to determine the compensation which appears to it to be just as provided in Section 110-B of the Act and to specify the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid. The determination of the compensation payable and its apportionment as required by Section 110-B of the Act amongst the legal representatives for whose benefit an application may be filed under Section 110-A of the Act have to be done in accordance with well-known principles of law. We should remember that in an Indian family brothers, sisters and brothers’ children and some times foster children live together and they are dependent upon the bread-winner of the family and if the bread-winner is killed on account of a motor vehicle accident, there is no justification to deny them compensation relying upon the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 which as we have already held has been substantially modified by the provisions contained in the Act in relation to cases arising out of motor vehicles accidents. We express our approval of the decision in Megjibhai Khimji Vira v. Chaturbhai Taljabhai, (AIR 1977 Guj.195) and hold that the brother of a person who dies in a motor vehicle accident is entitled to maintain a petition under Section 110-A of the Act if he is a legal representative of the deceased.”

12. From the aforesaid quoted extract it is evident that only if there is a justification in consonance with principles of justice, equity and good conscience, a dependant of the deceased may be denied right to claim compensation. Hence, we find no merit in the submission advanced on behalf of the respondent-Insurance Company that the claim petition is not maintainable because of the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act.

13. On behalf of the appellants it has been rightly contended that proceeding before the Motor Vehicle Claims Tribunal is a summary proceeding and unless there is evidence in support of such pleading that the claimant is not a legal representative and therefore the claim petition be dismissed as not maintainable, no such plea can be raised at a subsequent stage and that also through a writ petition. The objection filed on behalf of the Insurance Company, contained in annexure P.2, does not raise any such objection nor there is any evidence led on this issue. As noted earlier, the Tribunal did frame any issue regarding maintainability of the claim petition on law and fact as issue no.1 but the findings recorded by the Tribunal at page 41 of the paper book show that this issue together with issue nos. 2 and 3 were not pressed by the opposite parties during trial and were accordingly decided in favour of the claimants.

14. In the aforesaid circumstances, the order under appeal dated 20.8.2002 allowing the writ petition suffers from apparent mistake in not noticing the relevant issue decided by the Tribunal and also the fact that the Insurance Company, which was the writ petitioner, had not pressed this issue. It had neither raised pleadings nor led evidence relevant for the said issue.

15. On coming to know about the High Court judgment the appellants filed a review petition in which they gave all the relevant facts including the constitution of the society appellant no.1 in support of their claim that a `Brother’ of the Society renounced his relations with the natural family and all his earnings and belongings including insurance claims belonged to the society. These facts could not have been ignored by the High Court but even after noticing such facts the review petition was rejected.

16. A perusal of the judgment and order of the Tribunal discloses that although issue no.1 was not pressed and hence decided in favour of the claimants/appellants, while considering the quantum of compensation for the claimants the Tribunal adopted a very cautious approach and framed a question for itself as to what should be the criterion for assessing compensation in such case where the deceased was a Roman Catholic and joined the church services after denouncing his family, and as such having no actual dependants or earning? For answering this issue the Tribunal relied not only upon judgments of American and English Courts but also upon Indian judgments for coming to the conclusion that even a religious order or organization may suffer considerable loss due to death of a voluntary worker. The Tribunal also went on to decide who should be entitled for compensation as legal representative of the deceased and for that purpose it relied upon the Full Bench judgment of Patna High Court reported in AIR 1987 Pat. 239, which held that the term `legal representative’ is wide enough to include even “intermeddlers” with the estate of a deceased. The Tribunal also referred to some Indian judgments in which it was held that successors to the trusteeship and trust property are legal representatives within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

17. In the light of the aforesaid discussions, we have no hesitation in holding that the High Court erred in law in setting aside the judgment of the learned Tribunal by ignoring the fact that the respondent-Insurance Company had not pressed issue no.1 nor it had pleaded and led evidence in respect to the said issue. The Court explained that the appellants were the legal representatives of the deceased. Such an issue of facts could not be decided by the High Court for the first time in a writ petition which could only be entertained under Article 227 of the Constitution for limited purpose.

18. Accordingly, orders of the High Court dated August 20, 2002 and December 10, 2003 are set aside and the judgment and order of the Tribunal dated July 14, 1994, is restored. The dues of compensation including interest, as per judgment of the Tribunal, shall be deposited by the respondent-Insurance Company with the Tribunal within eight weeks from the date of this order. The Tribunal shall permit the claimants to withdraw the same in the light of its order",1
STATE (NCT OF DELHI),"The State of Delhi, aggrieved by the order dated 28th of November, 2011 passed by the Delhi High Court in Criminal M.C. No. 2540 of 2011, whereby it had directed for release of the vehicle bearing Registration No. HR-56-7290 to the registered owner on security, has preferred this special leave petition.

Leave granted.

Shorn of unnecessary details, facts giving rise to the present appeal are that while constables Raghmender Singh and Sunil were on night patrolling duty at Kirari Nithari turn on 17th of April, 2011, they saw a vehicle coming from the side of the Nithari Village. Constable Raghmender Singh signalled the driver to stop the vehicle, but he did not accede to his command and turned the vehicle into the Prem Nagar Extension Lane. Both the constables chased the vehicle on their motorcycle and the driver of the vehicle, apprehending that he would be caught, left the vehicle and ran away from the place, taking advantage of the darkness. The vehicle abandoned by the driver was “Cruiser Force” and had registration No. HR-56- 7290. After opening of the windows of the vehicle, 27 Cartons, each containing 12 bottles of 750 ml. Mashaledar country-made liquor and 20 Cartons, each containing 48 quarters of Besto Whisky were found inside the vehicle. All the 47 Cartons were embossed with ‘Sale in Haryana only’. Constable Raghmender Singh gave a report to the police and on that basis FIR No. 112 of 2011 dated 17.04.2011 was registered at Aman Vihar Police Station under Section 33(a) and Section 58 of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009. During the course of investigation, Narender, respondent herein, claiming to be the owner of the vehicle, filed an application for its release on security, before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini, who, by his order dated 24th of May, 2011 rejected the same, inter alia, holding that he has no power to release the vehicle seized in connection with the offence under the Delhi Excise Act. The respondent again filed an application for the same relief i.e. for release of the vehicle on security before the Metropolitan Magistrate but the said application also met with the same fate. By order-dated 14th of July, 2011, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate declined to pass the order for release, inter alia, observing that any order directing for release of the vehicle on security would amount to review of the order dated 24th of May, 2011, which power the court did not possess.

Aggrieved by the same, the respondent filed an application before the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Code’), assailing the order dated 24th May, 2011 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. The High Court, by its impugned order dated 28th of November, 2011 directed the vehicle to be released in favour of the registered owner on furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Metropolitan Magistrate. While doing so, the High Court has observed as follows:

“………The vehicle in question was seized by the Police and not confiscated and if that was so, Section 58, Delhi Excise Act would not apply with regard to the vehicle in question and the procedure that was to be followed regarding the vehicle was to be found in Chapter VI of Delhi Excise Act and also Section 451, Cr.P.C………” Mr. Mohan Jain, Additional Solicitor General appears on behalf of the appellant whereas the respondent is represented by Mr. Harish Pandey. Mr. Jain submits that in view of the embargo put by Section 61 of the Delhi Excise Act, the High Court had no jurisdiction to pass an order for release of the vehicle on security. Mr. Pandey, however, submits that the High Court has the power under Section 451 of the Code to direct for release of the vehicle on security and the same is legal and valid.
Rival submissions necessitate examination of the scheme of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’). Section 33 of the Act provides for penalty for unlawful import, export, transport, manufacture, possession, sale etc. of intoxicant and Section 33(a), which is relevant for the purpose reads as follows:

“33. Penalty for unlawful import, export, transport, manufacture, possession, sale, etc.- (1) Whoever, in contravention of provision of this Act or of any rule or order made or notification issued or of any licence, permit or pass, granted under this Act-
(a) manufactures, imports, exports, transports or removes any intoxicant;
xxx xxx xxx shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees.” Section 58 of the Act provides for confiscation of certain things and Section 58(d) thereof, with which we are concerned in the present appeal, reads as follows:
“58. Certain things liable to confiscation.- Whenever an offence has been committed, which is punishable under this Act, following things shall be liable to confiscation, namely-
xxx xxx xxx
(d) any animal, vehicle, vessel, or other conveyance used for carrying the same.” From a plain reading of Section 33(a) of the Act, it is evident that transportation of any intoxicant in contravention of the provisions of the Act or of any rule or order made or notification issued or any licence, permit or pass, is punishable and any vehicle used for carrying the same, is liable for confiscation under Section 58(d) of the Act. Section 59 of the Act deals with the power of confiscation of Deputy Commissioner in certain cases. Section 59(1) thereof provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law where anything liable for confiscation under Section 58 is seized or detained, the officer seizing and detaining such thing shall produce the same before the Deputy Commissioner. On production of the seized property, the Deputy Commissioner, if satisfied that the offence under the Act has been committed, may order confiscation of such property. Therefore, under the scheme of the Act any vehicle used for carrying the intoxicant is liable to be confiscated and on seizure of the vehicle transporting the intoxicant, the same is required to be produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the power of its confiscation.
Section 61 of the Act puts an embargo on jurisdiction of courts, the same reads as follows:
“61. Bar of jurisdiction in confiscation.- Whenever any intoxicant, material, still, utensil, implement, apparatus or any receptacle, package, vessel, animal, cart, or other conveyance used in committing any offence, is seized or detained under this Act, no court shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force, have jurisdiction to make any order with regard to such property.” According to this section, notwithstanding anything contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force, no court shall have jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used in committing any offence and seized under the Act.
It is relevant here to state that in the present case, the High Court, while releasing the vehicle on security has exercised its power under Section 451 of the Code. True it is that where any property is produced by an officer before a criminal court during an inquiry or trial under this section, the court may make any direction as it thinks fit for the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, as the case may be. At the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, the court may also, under Section 452 of the Code, make an order for the disposal of the property produced before it and make such other direction as it may think necessary. Further, where the property is not produced before a criminal court in an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate is empowered under Section 457 of the Code to make such order as it thinks fit. In our opinion, the general provision of Section 451 of the Code with regard to the custody and disposal of the property or for that matter by destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person entitled to possession thereof under Section 452 of the Code or that of Section 457 authorising a Magistrate to make an order for disposal of property, if seized by an officer and not produced before a criminal court during an inquiry or trial, however, has to yield where a statute makes a special provision with regard to its confiscation and disposal. We have referred to the scheme of the Act and from that it is evident that the vehicle seized has to be produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the power of its confiscation or release to its rightful owner. The requirement of production of seized property before the Deputy Commissioner under Section 59(1) of the Act is, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, and, so also is the power of confiscation. Not only this, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force, no court, in terms of Section 61 of the Act, has jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used in commission of any offence under the Act. In the present case, the Legislature has used a non-
obstante clause not only in Section 59 but also in Section 61 of the Act. As is well settled, a non-obstante clause is a legislative device to give effect to the enacting part of the section in case of conflict over the provisions mentioned in the non-obstante clause. Hence, Section 451, 452 and 457 of the Code must yield to the provisions of the Act and there is no escape from the conclusion that the Magistrate or for that matter the High Court, while dealing with the case of seizure of vehicle under the Act, has any power to pass an order dealing with the interim custody of the vehicle on security or its release thereof. The view which we have taken finds support from a judgment of this Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. K.A. Kunchindammed, (2002) 9 SCC 90, which while dealing with somewhat similar provisions under the Karnataka Forest Act held as follows:-

“23……….The position is made clear by the non obstante clause in the relevant provisions giving overriding effect to the provisions in the Act over other statutes and laws. The necessary corollary of such provisions is that in a case where the Authorized Officer is empowered to confiscate the seized forest produce on being satisfied that an offence under the Act has been committed thereof the general power vested in the Magistrate for dealing with interim custody/release of the seized materials under CrPC has to give way. The Magistrate while dealing with a case of any seizure of forest produce under the Act should examine whether the power to confiscate the seized forest produce is vested in the Authorized Officer under the Act and if he finds that such power is vested in the Authorized Officer then he has no power to pass an order dealing with interim custody/release of the seized material. This, in our view, will help in proper implementation of provisions of the special Act and will help in advancing the purpose and object of the statute. If in such cases power to grant interim custody/release of the seized forest produce is vested in the Magistrate then it will be defeating the very scheme of the Act. Such a consequence is to be avoided.
24. From the statutory provisions and the analysis made in the foregoing paragraphs the position that emerges is that the learned Magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge were right in holding that on facts and in the circumstances of the case, it is the Authorized Officer who is vested with the power to pass order of interim custody of the vehicle and not the Magistrate.
The High Court was in error in taking a view to the contrary and in setting aside the orders passed by the Magistrate and the Sessions Judge on that basis.” From a conspectus of what we have observed above, the impugned order of the High Court is found to be vulnerable and, therefore, the same cannot be allowed to stand.

To put the record straight it is relevant here to state that the counsel for the respondent had not, and in our opinion rightly, challenged the vires of the provisions of the Act in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Oma Ram v. State of Rajasthan, (2008) 5 SCC 502, which upheld a somewhat similar provision existing in the Rajasthan Excise Act.

In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and hold that the High Court exceeded in its jurisdiction in directing for release of the vehicle on security.",1
Praful Manohar Rele,"This appeal arises out of a judgment and order dated 16th October, 2009 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay whereby the High Court has allowed Civil Second Appeal No.90 of 1992 set aside the judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge in Civil Appeal No.33 of 1987 and restored that passed by the Trial Court dismissing Regular Civil Suit No.87 of 1984. The factual backdrop in which the dispute arose may be summarized as under:

3. Manohar Narayan Rele owned a house bearing Panchayat No.105 situate in village Ravdanda, Taluka Alibag, District Raigad, in the State of Maharashtra. In RCS No.87 of 1984 filed by the said Shri Rele before the Civil Judge (Junior Division), Alibag, the plaintiff prayed for a decree for possession of the suit premises comprising a part of the house mentioned above on the ground that the defendants who happened to be the legal heirs of one Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar, a Goldsmith by profession, residing in Bombay was allowed to occupy the suit premises as a gratuitous licensee on humanitarian considerations without any return, compensation, fee or charges for such occupation. Upon the demise of Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar in February 1978, the defendants who stepped into his shoes as legal heirs started abusing the confidence reposed by the plaintiff in the said Ghosalkar and creating nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff with the result that the plaintiff was forced to terminate the licence granted by him in terms of a notice assuring for delivery of vacant possession of the premises w.e.f. 1st February, 1984. Upon receipt of the notice, the defendants instead of complying with the same sent a reply refusing to vacate the premises on the false plea that they were occupying the same as tenants since the time of Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar and were paying rent although the plaintiff had never issued any receipt acknowledging such payment. In a rejoinder sent to the defendants, the plaintiff denied the allegations made by the defendants and by way of abundant caution claimed possession of the suit premises even on the grounds permitted under the Rent Control Act of course without prejudice to his contention that the defendants could not seek protection under the Rent Act. Time for vacation of the premises was also extended by the said rejoinder upto the end of April, 1984.

4. The defendants did not vacate the premises thereby forcing the plaintiff to file a suit for possession against them on the ground that they were licensees occupying the premises gratuitously and out of humanitarian considerations. It was alternatively urged that the plaintiff was entitled to vacation of the premises on the ground of bona fide personal need, nuisance, annoyance and damage allegedly caused to the premise and to the adjoining garden land belonging to him.

5. In the written statement filed by the defendants they stuck to their version that the suit property was occupied by Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar as a tenant and upon his demise the defendants too were in occupation of the same as tenants.

6. On the pleadings of the parties the Trial Court framed as many as eight issues and eventually dismissed the suit holding that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendants were gratuitous licensees. The Trial Court also held that the defendants had proved that they were occupying the premises as tenants on a monthly rent of Rs.13/- and that the plaintiff had failed to prove that he required the premises for his bona fide personal use and occupation. Issues regarding the defendants causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff and damage to the property were also held against the plaintiff by the Trial Court while declining relief to the plaintiff.

7. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court, the plaintiff preferred Civil Appeal No.33 of 1987 before the Additional District Judge, Alibag who formulated six points for determination and while allowing the appeal filed by the plaintiff decreed the suit in favour of his legal representatives as the original plaintiff had passed away in the meantime. The First Appellate Court held that the plaintiff had successfully established that the suit premises was occupied by Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar on gratuitous and humanitarian grounds. It also held that the defendants-respondents had failed to prove the existence of any tenancy in their favour and that since the license granted to the defendants had been validly terminated, the legal heirs substituted in place of the original plaintiff were entitled to a decree.

8. Second appeal No.90 of 1992 was then filed by the respondent against the judgment of the First Appellate Court before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay which was allowed by a Single Judge of that Court in terms of its judgment impugned in the present appeal. Apart from three substantial questions of law which the High Court had formulated for consideration, it framed a fourth question for consideration which was to the following effect:

“Whether the plaintiff could raise two contradictory pleas in the plaint, namely, that (i) the defendants were permitted to occupy the suit premises gratis; and (ii) that the defendants should be evicted from the suit premises under the provisions of the Bombay Rent Act?”
9. Significantly, the decision rendered by the High Court rests entirely on the fourth question extracted above. The High Court has taken the view that while the plaintiff could indeed seek relief in the alternative, the contentions raised by him were not in the alternative but contradictory, hence, could not be allowed to be urged. The High Court found that the plaintiff’s case that the defendant was a gratuitous licensee was incompatible with the plea that he was a tenant and, therefore, could be evicted under the Rent Act. The High Court observed:

“It is now well settled that a plaintiff may seek reliefs in the alternative but in fact the pleadings are mutually opposite, such pleas cannot be raised by the plaintiff. There is an essential difference between contradictory pleas and alternative pleas. When the plaintiff claims relief in the alternative, the cause of action for the reliefs claimed is the same. However, when contradictory pleas are raised, such as in the present case, the foundation for these contradictory pleas is not the same. When the plaintiff proceeds on the footing that the defendant is a gratuitous licensee, he would have to establish that no rent or consideration was paid for the premises. Whereas, if he seeks to evict the defendant under the Rent Act, the plaintiff accepts that the defendant is in possession of the premises as a tenant and liable to pay rent. Thus, the issue whether rent is being paid becomes fundamental to the decision. Therefore, in my opinion, the pleas that the defendant is occupying the suit premises gratuitously is not compatible with the plea that the defendant is a tenant and therefore can be evicted under the Rent Act.”
10. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length. The case of the plaintiff appellant herein primarily was that the original defendant and even his legal representatives were occupying the suit premises as gratuitous licensees upon termination whereof the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for possession. While the Trial Court found that the defendants were tenants and not licensees as alleged by the plaintiff the First Appellate Court had recorded a clear finding to the contrary holding that the defendants were indeed occupying the premises as licensees whose license was validly terminated by the plaintiff. Whether or not the defendants were licensees as alleged by the plaintiff was essentially a question of fact and had to be answered on the basis of the evidence on record which the First Appellate Court had reappraised to hold that the defendants were let into the suit property by the plaintiff on humanitarian grounds and as gratuitous licensees. Absence of any rent note evidencing payment of rent or any other material or circumstance to suggest that the relationship between the parties was that of landlord and tenant, abundantly supported the conclusion of the First Appellate Court. That finding also negatived the defence of the defendants-respondents that they were occupying the premises as tenants which assertion of the defendant- respondent was held not proved by the First Appellate Court. There is no gainsaid that while considering the question whether the relationship between the parties was that of licensor and licensee as alleged by the plaintiff or landlord and tenant as asserted by the defendants, the First Appellate Court took into consideration the totality of the evidence on record with a view to finding out as to which of the two versions was factually correct. That doubtless was the correct approach to adopt in a suit based on an alleged license where the defendant’s logical defence was bound to be that he is in occupation not as a licensee but as a tenant. There was, in that view, nothing special or novel about the plea raised in defence by the defendants-respondents. What is important is that the First Appellate Court on facts found that the defendants and even their predecessor were licensees in the premises which stood validly terminated. The High Court could not have interfered with that finding of fact leave alone on the ground that since the alternative case set up by the plaintiff in the plaint was contradictory to the primary case pleaded by him, he was entitled to relief even on proof of the primary case.

11. That apart the alternative plea of the plaintiff and the defence set up by the defendants was no different from each other. The only question that would fall for determination based on such a plea was whether the plaintiff had made out a case on the grounds permissible under the Rent Control Act. An adjudication on that aspect would become necessary only if the plaintiff did not succeed on the primary case set up by him. The alternative plea would be redundant if the plaintiff’s case of the defendants being gratuitous licenses was accepted by the Court. That is precisely what had happened in the instant case. The First Appellate Court accepted the plaintiff’s case that defendants were in occupation as licensees and not as tenants. The High Court has not set aside that finding of fact on its merits. It may have been a different matter if the High Court had done so for valid reasons and then declined to entertain the alternative case set up by the plaintiff based on tenancy. One could in that case perhaps argue that the Court had declined to go beyond the principal contention to examine the alternative plea which was contradictory to the principal plea. That, however, is not what the High Court has done. Without finding fault with the findings recorded by the First Appellate Court on the question of a license and its termination the High Court has dismissed the suit simply because the plea of tenancy was, in its opinion, contradictory to the plea of license set up in the earlier part of the plaint. That was not, in our opinion, a proper approach or course to follow.

12. The upshot of the above discussion is that the order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained. Having said that we may deal with the question whether the plea of license and tenancy could be together urged by the plaintiff for grant of relief in a suit for possession.

13. The general rule regarding inconsistent pleas raised in the alternative is settled by a long line of decisions rendered by this Court. One of the earliest decisions on the subject was rendered by this Court in Srinivas Ram Kumar v. Mahabir Prasad and Ors. AIR 1951 SC 177, where this Court observed :

“It is true that it was no part of the plaintiff's case as made in the plaint that the sum of Rs. 30,000 was advanced by way of loan to the defendant second party. But it was certainly open to the plaintiff to make an alternative case to that effect and make a prayer in the alternative for a decree for money even if the allegations of the money being paid in pursuance of a contract of sale could not be established by evidence. The fact that such a prayer would have been inconsistent with the other prayer is not really material…An Appellant may rely upon different rights alternatively and there is nothing in the Civil Procedure Code to prevent a party from making two or more inconsistent sets of allegations and claiming relief thereunder in the alternative.”
14. In Bhagwati Prasad v. Chandramaul AIR 1966 SC 735 the plea of licence was accepted against the plea of tenancy although the plea of licence was not set up by the appellant. The appellant in that case contended that the land and the construction over the land belonged to him and that he had let the constructed portion to the respondent on a monthly rental basis. The respondent, however, alleged that although the land belonged to the appellant the building standing over the same was constructed by the respondent out of his own money and, therefore, he was entitled to occupy the same till his money was recovered from the appellant. Since the plea of tenancy set up by the appellant could not be proved, the Court held that the respondent was staying in the house with the leave and licence of the appellant. What is important is that the Court clearly recognised the principle that if the plea raised by the tenant in his written statement was clear and unambiguous in a suit where one party alleged the relationship between the two to be that of licensor and licensee, while the other alleged the existence of a tenancy, only two issues arose for determination, namely, whether the defendant is tenant of the plaintiff or is holding the property as a licensee. If the Court comes to the conclusion after the parties lead their evidence that the tenancy had not been proved then the only logical inference was that the defendant was in possession of the property as a licensee. This Court said:

“In such a case the relationship between the parties would be either that of a landlord and tenant, or that of an owner of property and a person put into possession if it by the owner's license. No other alternative is logically or legitimately possible. When parties led evidence in this case, clearly they were conscious of this position, and so, when the High Court came to the conclusion that the tenancy had not been proved, but the defendant's argument also had not been established, it clearly followed that the defendant was in possession of the suit premises by the leave and license of the plaintiff………………………………….. In our opinion, having regard to the pleas taken by the defendant in his written statement in clear and unambiguous language, only two issues could arise between the parties: is the defendant the tenant of the plaintiff, or is he holding the property as the license ,subject to the terms specified by the written statement?.... we are unable to see any error of law in the approach by the High Court in dealing with it.” (emphasis supplied)
15. In G. Nagamma and Anr. v. Siromenamma and Anr. (1996) 2 SCC 25, this Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to plead even inconsistent pleas especially when, they are seeking alternative reliefs.

16. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in B.K. Narayana Pillai v. Parameswaran Pillai 2000(1) SCC 712. In that case the appellant- defendant wanted to amend the written statement by taking a plea that in case he is not held to be a lessee, he was entitled to the benefit of Section 60(b) of the Indian Easements Act, 1882. Allowing the amendment this Court held that the plea sought to be raised was neither inconsistent nor repugnant to the pleas raised in defence. The Court further declared that there was no absolute bar against taking of inconsistent pleas by a party. What is impermissible is taking of an inconsistent plea by way of an amendment thereby denying the other side the benefit of an admission contained in the earlier pleadings. In cases where there was no inconsistency in the facts alleged a party is not prohibited from taking alternative pleas available in law.

17. Reference may also be made to the decision of this Court in J.J. Lal Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. M.R. Murali and Anr. (2002) 3 SCC 98 where this Court formulated the following tests for determining whether the alternative plea raised by the plaintiff was permissible:

“To sum up the gist of holding in Firm Sriniwas Ram Kumar's case: If the facts stated and pleading raised in the written statement, though by way of defence to the case of the plaintiff, are such which could have entitled the plaintiff to a relief in the alternative, the plaintiff may rely on such pleading of the defendant and claim an alternate decree based thereon subject to four conditions being satisfied, viz., (i) the statement of case by defendant in his written statement amounts to an express admission of the facts entitling the plaintiff to an alternative relief, (ii) in granting such relief the defendant is not taken by surprise, (iii) no injustice can possibly result to the defendant, and (iv) though the plaintiff would have been entitled to the same relief in a separate suit the interest of justice demand the plaintiff not being driven to the need of filing another suit.”
18. The plaintiff-appellant in the case at hand had set up a specific case that the defendant as also his legal representative after his demise were occupying the suit premises as licensees which licence had been validly terminated. In the reply to the notice the case of the defendants was that were in occupation of the suit premises not as licensees but as tenants. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled on that basis alone to ask for an alternative relief of a decree for eviction on the grounds permissible under the Rent Control Act. Such an alternative plea did not fall foul if any of the requirements/tests set out in the decision of this Court in J.J. Lal’s case (supra). We say so because the written statement filed by the defendant contained an express admission of the fact that the property belonged to the plaintiff and that the defendants were in occupation thereof as tenants. At the trial Court also the question whether the defendants were in occupation as licencee or as tenants had been specifically put in issue thereby giving the fullest opportunity to the parties to prove their respective cases. There was no question of the defendants being taken by surprise by the alternative case pleaded by the plaintiff nor could any injustice result from the alternative plea being allowed and tried by the Court. As a matter of fact the trial Court had without any demurrer gone into the merits of the alternative plea and dismissed the suit on the ground that the plaintiff had not been able to prove a case for eviction of the defendants. There was thus not only a proper trial on all those grounds urged by the plaintiff but also a judgment in favour of the defendant respondents. Last but not the least even if the alternative plea had not been allowed to be raised in the suit filed by the appellant he would have been certainly entitled to raise that plea and seek eviction in a separate suit filed on the very same grounds. The only difference may have been that the suit may have then been filed before the Court of Small Causes but no error of jurisdiction was committed in the instant case as the finding recorded by the Civil Court was that the defendants were licensees and not tenants. Superadded to all these factors is the fact that the appellate Court had granted relief to the appellant not in relation to the alternative plea raised by him but on the principal case set up by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff succeeded on the principal case set up by him whether or not the alternative plea was contradictory or inconsistent or even destructive of the original plea paled into insignificance.

19. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is, hereby allowed, the impugned judgment passed by the High Court is set aside and that passed by the first appellate Court is restored. The respondents are granted time till 30th April 2014 to vacate the premises subject to their filing undertakings on usual terms before this Court within six weeks from today. In case the undertakings are not filed, as directed, the decree passed in favour of the appellant shall become executable forthwith. No costs",1
Varinder Singh,"This appeal is filed by the appellant questioning the correctness of the judgment and final order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in petition Crl. Misc. No. M-13296 of 2011 (O & M) urging various facts and legal contentions in support of his case.

3. Necessary relevant facts are stated hereunder to appreciate the case of the appellant and also to find out whether the appellant is entitled to the relief prayed for in this appeal.

The appellant had gone as a visitor to the Central Jail, Ferozepur on 17.09.2009. There, on being searched, a mobile phone was recovered from his turban and a charger was recovered from his shoes. An FIR dated 24.09.2009 was filed at the Police Station Ferozepur, under Sections 42 and 45 (12) of the Prisons Act, 1894 (in short “the Act”). The Chief Judicial Magistrate of Ferozepur charged him on 01.05.2010 under Sections 42 and 45 of the Act. The appellant approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana by way of a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, praying that the FIR be quashed. The High Court of Punjab and Haryana by way of impugned judgment and final order dated 19.07.2013 dismissed the petition, and inter alia held that “….the accused is at liberty to take all pleas available to him during the trial”.

4. The High Court in its impugned order has interpreted Section 42 of the Act, and held that whoever communicates or attempts to communicate with any prisoner is liable for punishment. It said that the appellant herein was entering the jail with a mobile phone and its charger, apparently to enable communication with a prisoner. It was held that “ After presentation of challan, charges have already been framed against the petitioner. In these circumstances, at this stage, no ground for quashing of the FIR in question is made out.”

5. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the High Court had not appreciated the contention that the offence under Sections 42 and 45 of the Act is not made out, and that mobile phone and charger are not included in the list of the prohibited articles. It was also contended that section 52-A, which prohibited the carrying of a mobile phone, has not been notified yet, and that it is still a Bill. It was further contended that even if the notification were to be taken as implementable, it was dated 08.03.2011. The offence is admittedly of 2009, and thus, this notification will not apply to the case as the same is prospective in nature.

6. The learned counsel for the respondents contended that the appellant was hiding a mobile phone in his turban and a charger in his shoe, thus, prima facie, the case under Section 42 of the Act has been made out against him. The counsel also contended that the sections mentioned in the charge sheet are attracted, and that there is no reason for the courts to interfere at this stage.

7. We have heard the rival legal contentions and perused the documents produced on record. Two issues arise for our consideration:

1) Whether an offence is made out under Sections 42 and 45 (12) of the Prisons Act?

2) Whether the High Court was justified in rejecting the petition to quash the FIR?

Answer to Point no.1

8. We have to examine Sections 42 and 45 of the Act in detail in order to understand the issue at hand. Section 45 of the Act provides for acts which are declared to be prison offences when committed by a prisoner. Clause (12) makes receiving, possessing or transferring any prohibited article a prison offence.

9. The appellant was not a prisoner at the date of the commission of the offence. He could thus, not have committed a ‘prison offence’ as defined under Section 45 of the Act. Hence, no offence is made out under Section 45 of the Act. Insofar as Section 42 of the Act is concerned, it provides that only that communication, which is contrary to the rules made under Section 59 of the Act is prohibited. Section 42 of the Act reads as under :

“42. Penalty for introduction or removal of prohibited articles into or from prison and communication with prisoners.— Whoever, contrary to any rule under section [59] introduces or removes, or attempts by any means whatever to introduce or remove, into or from any prison, or supplies or attempts to supply to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, any prohibited article, and every officer of a prison who, contrary to any such rule, knowingly suffers any such article to be introduced into or removed from any prison, to be possessed by any prisoner, or to be supplied to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, and whoever, contrary to any such rules, communicates or attempts to communicate with any prisoner, and whoever abets any offence made punishable by this section, shall, on conviction before a Magistrate, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to fine not exceeding two hundred rupees, or to both.”
10. The Punjab Jail Manual lists the prohibited articles in Punjab prisons. Para 606 of the Manual lists the following Prohibited Articles:

“…..

1) Spirituous liquors of every description

2) Tobacco and all other substances whatsoever which are or may be intended to be used for the purpose of smoking, chewing or snuffing, and all instruments and appliances whatsoever, which may be used for or in connection with smoking, chewing or snuffing,

3) All explosive, intoxicating or poisonous substances, and chemicals whether fluid or solid of whatever description.

4) All arms and weapons, and articles which are capable of being used as weapons of whatever description.

5) All bullion, metal, coin, jewellery, ornaments, currency notes, securities and articles of value of every description.

6) All books, paper and printed or written matter and materials and appliances for printing or writing of whatever description.

7) String, rope, chains and all materials, which are capable of being converted into string or rope or chains, of whatever description.

8) Wood, bricks, stones and earth of every description.” This list does not mention Mobile phone or charger as one of the prohibited articles. Thus, the communication, even if it was attempted to being done, was not contrary to the prison rules, and thus, is not an offence under Section 42 of the Act.

11. The Prisons (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2011 provides for the addition of section 52-A to the Act. This Section reads thus :

“52-A. (1)-Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if any prisoner is found guilty of possessing, operating or using a mobile phone or their component parts as like SIM card, memory card, battery or charger or if the prisoner or any other person assists or abets or instigates in the supply thereof, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, not exceeding one year or with fine not exceeding Rs 25,000 or with both……” This Section, thus, makes the possession of the mobile phone by the prisoner and supplying the phone by any person an offence. The notification by the Punjab Government that this section is in force is dated 08.03.2011.
The FIR for the offence was dated 24.09.2009. This notification will obviously not apply to the case in hand as the alleged offence was committed in 2009, and retrospective effect will not apply in the case of criminal laws. Hence, there is no offence made out against the appellant and we cannot accept the reasoning of the High Court in the impugned judgment. We hereby hold that this section cannot be made applicable to the facts of the present case.

Answer to point no.2

12. It is our view that in light of the settled legal principles, the High Court has erred in dismissing the petition to quash the FIR.

13. Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as under :-

“482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court: Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.” Under this Section, the High Court has the power to quash an FIR. This court in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1] has laid down the following categories of cases in which the High Court can exercise its power under Section 482 and quash the FIR:-
“1. Where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima-facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.
2. Where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers Under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.
4. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated Under Section 155(2) of the Code.
5. Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.”[2]
14. These principles were further reiterated by a three judge bench of this Court in the case of Sunder Babu v. State of Tamil Nadu[3].
15. The case of the appellant clearly falls under category (1) of the grounds of quashing of FIR mentioned in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra). On the date of the offence, mobile phone was not listed as one of the prohibited articles under the Punjab Prison Manual. Thus, no offence is made out under Section 42 of the Act, as there was no communication which was done or was attempted to being done contrary to the rules. Further, the appellant was not a prisoner on the date of the offence. Hence, he could not have committed a prison offence as defined under Section 45 of the Act.

16. In view of the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside. The FIR dated 24.09.2009 and the proceedings against the appellant are quashed. There will be no order as to costs",0
State of Gujarat,"The present appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 14th September 2006 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat in Criminal Confirmation Case No.9 of 2004 with Criminal Appeal No.1915/2004, setting aside the judgment and order passed by the Ld. Additional Sessions Judge and second Fast Track Court in Sessions Case No.4/2004 convicting the respondent under Section 376,302 and 201 IPC for the offence of rape and murder of a seven year old girl and punishing him with sentence of death. The High Court found severe loopholes and shortcomings in the prosecution story, rendering it unbelievable and thereby acquitted the respondent in the aforesaid case.

2. The prosecution case, in nutshell, was that the respondent/accused was the neighbour of the deceased girl Komal aged 7 years r/o village Bhammiya. On the day of incident i.e. 16.8.2003 the victim was playing with her two friends viz. Parul and Saroj in the courtyard of the respondent. The respondent/accused came to his house between 15.00 to 15.30 hrs. and scolded the girls for playing there. Parul and Saroj ran away whereas, however, the deceased girl was forcibly caught by the respondent and pushed her into his house and he shut the door. Shakriben Chandrasinh, a neighbour who was washing clothes, heard the cries of victim which got silent after sometimes. Thereafter Savitaben mother of the deceased girl, who returned from work at about 16.00 hrs. and not finding her daughter started searching for the victim along with Shakriben. A day after the incident, dead body of the victim was recovered from a nearby field wearing a white frock with undergarment missing, which was later found from the hedge falling between the house of the respondent and Shakriben Chandrasinh. A complaint was lodged and FIR registered by Arvindbhai Khatubhai, the father of the victim. The police started investigation and recorded the statements of witnesses. Necessary samples were also collected during the investigation and sent to FSL. The dead body of the deceased was sent for the post mortem which was conducted by Dr. Shashikant Nagori between 16.45 hrs. & 17.45 hrs. on 17.8.2003. The post mortem report mentioned following injuries:-

* Abrasion on both thighs, both knees and bruises over the legs.
* The injuries found on labia majora had a swelling of 3 x 2 cms. on right majora and abrasion on left majora, such injuries were possible in an attempted rape. There was penetration on the private parts of the victim girl.
* The presence of injuries on left mastoid region, which was bone deep and brain matter had come out of the wound.
* There was haematoma over whole skull on both parietal and frontal region and blood was oozing out of the left ear.
* There was a depressed fracture of skull on frontal and left parietal region.
The doctor opined that the injuries were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death and it was homicidal death.
3. The respondent was arrested after two days i.e. on 19.8.2003 from a nearby village, who had allegedly fled after committing the offence. On search, a suicide note purportedly written by the respondent was recovered from his pocket. Besides, blood stained clothes and blood group of the deceased was noticed on other articles. He was found to have sustained injuries on his person, which was recorded in the arrest panchnama. Upon disclosure of the accused, the grinding stone used in inflicting injuries on head of the deceased was recovered from his house. After the recovery of the stone, a panchnama of recovery of the stone was drawn in the presence of panch witnesses on 20.8.2003. Thereafter discovery panchnama of the articles was drawn which were concealed beneath the steel cupboard. After the completion of investigation, the charge sheet was filed before the Ld. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Godhra on 22.8.2003. After committal, the case was registered as Sessions Case No.4 of 2004 and charge against the respondent accused was framed under Sections 376,302 and 201 of the IPC. The respondent denied the charge and claimed to be tried. The prosecution examined 23 witnesses in support of its case. None was examined by the accused in his defence. The statement of the respondent was recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. On 7.10.2004 the learned Sessions Judge after examining the oral and documentary evidence, returned the finding of guilt and convicted the respondent for the offence of rape and murder. The learned Sessions Judge awarded capital punishment for the offence of murder u/s 302 and imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1000/- for the offence of rape u/s 376 and in default to undergo SI for 3 months. The record of the case was forwarded to the High Court u/s 366 of the Cr.P.C. for approval of the death sentence awarded by the Sessions Court. The accused also preferred Criminal Appeal No.1915/2004 before the High Court of Gujarat against the judgment and order dated 7.10.2004.

The Impugned Judgment:

4. As is clear from the above, the precise charge against the respondent was of raping the minor girl Komal and thereafter murdering her. The High Court, on the basis of medical evidence namely the post-mortem report of the deceased found that it was case of homicidal death. There is no quarrel about the same and this aspect is not disputed by the respondent before us as well.

5. As far as charge of rape is concerned, the High Court observed that there was no direct evidence and medical evidence was the only circumstantial evidence which could be relied upon. It discussed the evidence of Dr. Nagori to this effect, who had conducted the post mortem on the dead body. It was found that there was swelling of 3x2 cms on right labia majora and abrasion over left labia majora. It is also recorded in the postmortem notes that as per vagina examination, it was found that little finger passed with difficulty and there was no internal injury. The post mortem notes also indicated abrasions on both thighs, both knees and bruises over legs. In his deposition, the doctor has deposed, after describing the injuries, that the injuries found on labia majora were possible in an attempted rape. During cross-examination he deposed that, if there was penetration of penis in the vagina, there was possibility of internal injuries. He stated, in terms, that from the post mortem examination, in the instant case, there was no penetration of penis in the vagina.

6. On the basis of aforesaid, the High Court acquitted that offence of rape was not proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt and it could, at the most, be considered an attempted rape. The finding of the trial court recording the conviction for offence of rape under section 376 of the IPC has, accordingly, been set aside. It is primarily on the ground that even if it is to be accepted that in a case of rape of a minor, complete penetration of penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen is not necessarily to be established, in the instant case, the medical evidence clearly suggests that there was no penetration at all i.e. the factor which influenced the High Court to set aside the conviction based on section 376, IPC.

7. The High Court, thus, proceeded on the basis that the deceased was murdered and there was an attempted rape on her. It then addressed the central issue viz. whether the respondent could be connected with the said murder and attempted rape. It was a case of circumstantial evidence, in the absence of any eye witness. After discussing the evidence, the High Court found that prosecution had failed to establish the chain of circumstances could connect the accused with the crime. There were material contradictions and inconsistencies in the depositions of various witnesses etc. which did not form a complete chain. The High Court has, accordingly, set aside the order of conviction of the trial court as unsustainable and acquitted the accused of the charges. It is, inter-alia, held that the evidence led by the prosecution on last seen together cannot be accepted. It is not only contradictory, inconsistent and improbable, but also suffers from vice of improvements and therefore, it sounds unreliable. As regards injuries found on chest and back of the person of accused are concerned, which the prosecution tried to show as injuries caused with nail, possibly by the deceased, the High Court has discounted this prosecution version on the ground that the Post Mortem note does not indicate presence of any traces of skin of the accused in the nail of the deceased. As per the High Court the investigation is not found to be independent, trustworthy or reliable, the evidence does not establish a complete chain of circumstances to connect the accused with the crime. There are major defects in the investigations which render it doubtful when the case is founded on circumstantial evidence. It, thus, set aside the judgment of the Trial Court on the ground that the conviction cannot be recorded on such scanty, weak and incomplete evidence.

The Arguments:

8. The learned counsel for the State argued that High Court committed grave error in holding that there was no complete chain of the circumstances connecting the respondent to the incident. He pointed out that certain samples of blood, clay etc. were collected from the spot and FSM report (Ex.54) was obtained therefrom which was duly proved in the trial court through witness No.20-Chandubhai Nagjibhai Pargi who had stated in his deposition that on receiving the message from control room on 17.8.2003 he along with FSL Mobile Van had gone to the place of incident and collected the following samples:

            -    Clay with blood from the place of incident.

      Clay bearing doubtful spot recovered from the  place  in       between
                 two legs.

           -     Control clay recovered from the place at the distance of 5
                 feet from the dead body.

           -     Clay bearing pan padiki spittle recovered from  the  place
                 at the distance of 7 feet from the dead body.

           -     One red colour knickers bearing spots from the vada behind
the house of Chandrasinh Laxmansinh Chauhan, situated in the south direction from the dead body.

9. He further drew the attention of this Court to post mortem report (Ex.7) containing external examination of the deceased. As per the said post mortem report, the following aspects were established:

|1.  |Condition of the clothes whether |                             |
|    |wet with water, stained with     |Stained with blood           |
|    |blood, soiled with vomit or      |                             |
|    |foecal matter.                   |                             |
|2. |Injuries to external genitals, |Swelling (hemetomal) 3x2 cm | | |indication of purging. |over Rt.Labia mejora abrasion| | | |over lt.labia mejora. | |3. |Surface wounds and injuries their|a.Abrasions over medical | | |natural position, dimensions |upper of both thighs. | | |(measured) and directions to be |b.Abrasions over both knee. | | |accurately stated: their probable|c.Bruises over both legs. | | |ages and cause to be noted. | |

10. He also pointed out that opinion as to the cause or probable cause of death recorded by the Medical Officer was “cause of death is shocked due to head injury leading to skull injury over brain”. He also pointed out that cloth of the deceased was stained with blood and there were abrasions over medial upper both thighs, over both knees and bruises over both legs. According to the learned counsel, this shows that the deceased was subjected to sexual assault and murdered.

11. In order to connect the accused with the said incident, the learned counsel referred to the testimony of PW12, Saroj who was playing along with Parul and deceased on the fateful day, on the courtyard of the residence of the accused when the accused reached there and scolded these girls. His submission was that there was no cross-examination by the defence on this aspect and from this testimony it stood proved that the deceased was last seen with the accused, as PW12 had categorically stated that she and Parul left the place but the deceased remained there. He further submitted that this was corroborated by the neighbour Shakriben Chandrasinh (PW16) as well.

12. In nutshell, the submission of the learned counsel for the State was that the circumstances formed a complete chain of events connecting the crime to the accused inasmuch as: (1) the victim was last seen in the company of the accused; (2) certain samples were collected from the residence of the accused including plaster bearing blood, blood taken on thread by rubbing from ground floor of western wall, support (datto) of wooden plate bearing blood spots, pieces of paper affixed on the metal barrel, bearing blood spots etc.; the blood on the aforesaid as found was of “B” Group which is the blood group of the deceased; (3)clay from thighs with semen from the deceased was collected and semen was found to be of “O” Group which is that of the accused; (4) the medical evidence, which clearly nails the respondent and there could be no other person who would have committed this crime.

Our Analysis:

13. Since it is a case of circumstantial evidence and the prosecution case starts with the theory of last seen, the first place is as to whether the prosecution has been able to conclusively and beyond reasonable doubt prove that the deceased was last seen in the company of the respondent. For this purpose, as already noted above, the prosecution has relied upon the testimonies of PW12,PW16,PW17 and PW18. The paramount question is as to whether testimonies of these witnesses is reliable. The High Court has found certain inherent contradictions in the depositions of the aforesaid witnesses on the basis of which it has come to the conclusion that it is difficult to accept their version, which is even contrary to each other about the details of the events. No doubt PW12, Sarojben was playing with the deceased and Parul on the grounds of the residence of the accused and when respondent reached the spot, he asked them to left. However, thereafter whether the deceased remained there and was not seen at all thereafter till her dead body was found , is a pertinent question. As per the prosecution version itself the deceased had left that place; elbeit at the asking of the respondent who had sent her to the market to purchase Vimal Gutka and she returned back to the respondent after purchasing the said Gutka, to hand it over to the deceased. Whether it is conclusively proved that she returned back to the respondent? Here, according to the High Court, there are various contradictions in the depositions of the witnesses. As per PW7, the shopkeeper from where the deceased had gone to purchase Gutka, the deceased had come to his shop on that date at about 3 p.m. She purchased eatable ( and not Gutka) for Rupee one and then she went away. During cross-examination, he stated that it had not happened that the victim had come to his shop to purchase Vimal Gutka. So according to him deceased had come to his shop to purchase some eatable. He also admitted that in his statement before the police on 19th August 2003, he had not stated that the deceased had come to his shop to purchase eatable. On specific question put to him in the cross-examination as to why he did not tell the police about the victim’s visit to his shop to purchase eatable, he did not give any specific reply.

14. As per PW16(Shakriben),who is the neighbour of the respondent, she had seen the three girls playing in the courtyard of the respondent. She further stated that the respondent drove away Parul and Saroj and then caught the victim and pushed her into his house. Thereafter she heard cries of the victim and then she heard sound of beating. She has further stated that she went into the house thereafter but was threatened by the respondent that if she talked to anyone in the town, he would kill her and her son. She has further stated that the accused had arrived at about 2.30 p.m. on the day of the incident and he was drunk. He tried to push open the rear door of the house. The witness said that mother of the accused, Divaliben had given the key of the house to her and, therefore, she gave the key to the accused. The witness has further stated that on the next day when mother of the victim was searching the victim, she told her that she had not seen the victim and she joined the search. During cross- examination, the witness has admitted that she had not stated in her statement before police that the accused had intimidated her. She says that she does not know whether the victim had gone to purchase Gutka packet. The distance between her house and the house of the accused is 25 to 30 feet. She says that she did not tell her husband or her son about the incident. She admits that she did not state before police that, at the time of the incident, she went into the house after washing clothes and sat in the house and, at that time, accused had intimidated her that, if she tells anyone in the village, he would kill her and her son. She admits that, on the day of incident as well as on the next day, when people were searching for the girl, she did not tell anyone about the incident.

15. Apart from the aforesaid omissions on the part of PW16 and PW17 in not mentioning to the police when they gave their statements, immediately after the incident, the High Court has also analyzed their statements along with deposition of PW12 and found them to be inconsistent and self- contradictory in the following manner:

“From depositions of these three witnesses, the prosecution has tried to establish the circumstances of the accused having been seen in company of the deceased last. But scrutiny of this evidence leads us to negative this aspect. According to PW12- Saroj, she was playing with the victim and Parul. Accused arrived around 3O’ clock and shouted “Ladidiyo” (meaning young girls). Therefore, she and Parul ran away and the victim was left behind. She says that accused sent the victim to purchase a packet of Vimal. She also says that, thereafter, she went home and was doing lesson. She saw the victim going with a packet of Vimal to give it to the accused. Therefore, necessarily, if her say is taken at face value, then also the victim was seen going to the house of accused with a packet of Vimal and if she did factually reach there, at that point of time, neither Saroj nor Parul was present.
Against the above situation emerging from deposition of Saroj, if deposition of Shakariben (Ex.49) is seen, she says that when Saroj, the victim and Parul were playing in the courtyard of the accused, the accused arrived and drove away Parul and Saroj and caught hold of the victim and pushed her into the house, whereafter she heard cry of the victim and then sound of beating, meaning thereby that when the deceased was taken into the house, that was the last point of time when she was seen in company of the accused and, at that point of time, both Saroj and Parul were present, which is just contrary to what Saroj says. Viewed from another angle, Shakariben does not speak of any even taking place before the victim was pushed into the house and thereafter the incident has occurred, as against the say of Saroj that the accused sent the victim to get a packet of Vimal. Necessarily, therefore, what Shakariben saw was not the last point of time when the victim and the accused were together. The victim was seen by Saroj at a later point of time and also by witness-Himatbhai. Parul has not been examined by the prosecution as a witness. Therefore, the evidence regarding the accused seen last in company of the deceased, as led by the prosecution, is inconsistent and self-contradictory.
That apart, the conduct of PW16 seems to be unnatural and thus unworthy of reliance. The High Court has rightly observed that it does not inspire confidence for several reasons, namely: (1) though she claims to have the witness the accused pushing the victim into the house and then hearing her cry followed by sound of beating, she did not take any steps to rescue her. (2) She did not even tell about this incident to anyone, including her husband and son till 19th August 2003 when her statement was recorded. (3) Even in her statement to the police she has omitted to state the aforesaid purported facts.(4) On the next day of the incident, when the search for the victim was on, she still kept quite and did not disclose the incident to anybody. Strangely, she joins the group searching for the victim.(5) There is no explanation as to when and why the respondent could have intimidated her. As per the sequence of events narrated by her, the respondent came; she gave him the key of his house; the respondent went to his house and shouted at girls; the two other girls went away and respondent pushed the victim into house; and thereafter she (the witness went to her house). If these sequences are to be seen, there was no occasion for the accused to intimidate her.
As far as evidence of PW12,Saroj is concerned, she stated that she had lastly seen the deceased going with packet of Vimal. She simply presumed that the victim was going to give the said packet to the accused. However, she did not see the deceased going with packet of Vimal Gutka to the respondent as she specifically stated that after seeing the deceased carrying the packet of Vimal she went home and started doing her lesson. There is no evidence to show that the deceased reached the house of the accused and met him. In fact, there is some contradiction even on the purchase of the item inasmuch as as per PW17 the deceased had purchased eatable whereas PW-12 says that she was carrying Vimal Gutka. PW17 has specifically said that the deceased had not purchased Vimal Gutka from him. From the aforesaid testimonies of Saroj Shakariben the High Court has also observed that from both the evidence taken together, prosecution story cannot be believed inasmuch as if the situation is examined from a different angle, if what Saroj says had happened, then what Shakariben says could not have happened, because according to Shakariben, on arrival, the accused shouted at the girls and drove away Parul and Saroj and pushed the deceased into the house and, if what Shakariben says is correct, what Saroj says could not have happened. The doubt assumes greater strength because of certain circumstances which would be discussed in the paragraphs to follow.
Examined from any angle, the evidence led by the prosecution on last seen together aspect cannot be accepted. It is not only contradictory, inconsistent and improbable, but it also suffers from vice of improvements and, therefore, to us, it sounds unreliable. The case is founded on circumstantial evidence. This is one of the major circumstances pressed by the prosecution. We also find that the investigation is not carried out properly and does not inspire confidence. The evidence on last seen together aspect, therefore, cannot be accepted as a link in the chain of circumstances leading to exclusive hypothesis of guilt of the accused.”
16. We are in agreement with the aforesaid analysis of the evidence by the High Court and, therefore, hold that prosecution has not been able to establish, with clinching evidence that the deceased was seen lastly in the company of the accused.

17. Even the medical evidence on which strong reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the State, is of no help to arrive at the conclusion that guilt of the respondent stands proved beyond reasonable doubt. When the respondent was arrested on 19th August 2003 a Panchnama (Ex.14) was drawn. In that it is recorded that the accused had abrasions on chest, back and shoulder caused by nail and also that there was swelling on his penis and swelling on skin with abrasion. Immediately after his arrest, the respondent was sent for medical check up. As per the medical report (Ex.17) there were injuries on chest and back which is described by the doctor as linear abrasions. There were no foreign particles in his nails. The doctor also admitted in his cross-examination that he did not notice any injury on the penis of the accused. Therefore, this shows contradiction between the recording of medical condition in the Panchnama and the medical examination conducted by the doctor, in so far as they relate to the injury on the penis of the respondent. High Court has rightly observed that the Panchnama has recorded abrasions and therefore it could not have disappeared within such a short time. It reflects adversely on the prosecution case. As regards injuries found on chest and back of the respondent, they are tried to be shown as injuries caused with nail of the deceased. However, the post mortem note does not indicate presence of any traces of skin of the accused in nail of the deceased. Further, comments of the High Court in the impugned judgment about the medical evidence, pertinent for our purposes, are reproduced below as we entirely agree with the said analysis:

“From the above discussion of evidence, it is clear that even according to doctor, there was no bleeding injury on penis of the accused. There was no bleeding injury to the deceased either. There were no internal injuries in the vagina of the deceased. Against this, if the results of vaginal swab are seen, presence of blood and semen is found. How this could have been found is a question which has remained unexplained and unanswered. This would cast heavy doubt about the reliability of investigation. That apart, the group has remained unidentified so far as vaginal swab is concerned.
If evidence of Shakariben is seen and, even as per prosecution case, the incident occurred in the house of the accused and this is tried to be proved through deposition of Shakariben, who says that accused pushed the deceased into his house and, thereafter, she heard cry of the deceased and then sound of beating. As per the prosecution case, blood stains of the group of the deceased were found in the house of the accused at various places. No trace of semen was found in the house of the accused. But, surprisingly, at the place where the dead body was found, semen was found on the ground. That was of the group of the accused. If the incident occurred in the house, the traces of semen ought to have been found in the house and not at the place where the dead body was found. No motive is indicated for the accused to murder the deceased immediately after pushing her into the house and, if the rape or attempted rape was committed in the house followed by alleged murder, there would have been traces of semen in the house. These factors have remained unexplained and seem to have gone unnoticed by the trial court.”
18. The High Court has also expressed its doubts on recovery of grinding stone from the house of the respondent which was allegedly used for committing murder of the deceased. It is pointed out by the High Court that evidence suggests that the officer of the FSL was summoned on 19th August 2003 who inspected the place of incident and instructed the Inquiry Officer to recover the stone which was, accordingly, recovered. It is so stated in his report as well as in his deposition. Thus, as per the deposition of the officer of FSL, stone was recovered on 19th August 2003. As against this, as per discovery Panchnama drawn on 23rd August 2003 the said grinding stone was recovered from beneath steel cupboard at the instance of the respondent. How this recovery could have taken place if the stone had already been recovered on 19th August 2003. This casts doubt about the aforesaid documents and the discovery of stone itself.

19. There is another aspect highlighted by the High Court which is very pertinent and cannot be ignored. After the incident when sniffer dog was brought to the site. The said dog had tracked to the house of PW16 and not the respondent. In fact, on this basis the son of PW 16 was even taken into custody by the police and was detained for 2 days. Thereafter, he was allowed to go inasmuch, as per the police he had not committed any offence. This version has come from the testimony of PW16 herself. On the other hand, I.O. has totally denied that son of PW16 was ever detained for 2 days. There is no such entry in the daily diary as well. From this evidence appearing on record, the High Court has concluded that investigation cannot be considered as honest inasmuch as it would indicate to two possibilities, namely:

(1) The investigating officer did not detain or interrogate the son of PW16 for 2 days. If that is so he failed in his duty when the sniffer dog tracked to the house of PW16.
(2) If I.O. had detained the son of PW16, then case diary does not record the events correctly and he is not telling the truth before the Court.
That apart, it also speaks volumes about the reliability of the investigation and evidence collected, more so when no explanation is coming forward as to why the son of PW16 was released by the police and the respondent arrested.

20. We, thus, agree with the findings of the High Court that the evidence led by the prosecution does not establish a complete chain of circumstances to connect the accused with the murder of Komal, the deceased. There are significant defects and shortcomings in the investigation; witnesses have come out with contradictory version; and have made significant improvements in their versions in their depositions in the Court. In a case of circumstantial evidence, it would be unwise to record conviction on the basis of such a scanty, weak and incomplete evidence. As the prosecution has not been able to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt, agreeing with the conclusions of the High Court we dismiss the present appeal.",0
SH MEDICAL CENTRE HOSPITAL,"The present appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 13th March, 2009 passed by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in W.A. No. 362 of 2007 whereby the High Court dismissed the writ appeal of the appellant holding that the appellant-hospital is not entitled to building tax exemption relying on the judgment of the Kerala High Court in Medical Trust Hospital v. State of Kerala[1]. The appellant had filed writ petition No.605 of 2007 before the High Court of Kerala which dismissed the same by order dated 23.01.2007 on the ground that the building of the appellant is not used principally for charitable purposes, pursuant to which the above said writ appeal was filed which was also dismissed. Hence, this appeal.

3. The facts of the case in brief are stated hereunder:

SH Medical Centre is a charitable institution registered under the Travancore Cochin Literary, Scientific and Charitable Societies Registration Act, 1955. This institution manages the appellant hospital which is managed by nuns of the Christian religious faith who have renounced their worldly existence to serve humanity to render charitable services like free treatment to patients belonging to the lower strata of the society and charges nominal amount for treatment from those who can afford such treatment.

4. The Memorandum of the SH Medical Center states that the object of the institution is purely philanthropic purposes and not profit. It states that the members of the society are not entitled to any share in the net proceeds of the society and in case the society is wound up the assets of the society shall not go to any of the members and shall go to any other charitable trust, society or institution with similar objects or to the Government.

5. The appellant started constructing buildings to house the hospital. Several buildings were constructed from 1987-1988 to 2002-2003 for the functioning of the hospital. On 16.10.1995 the respondent passed an order exempting the appellant from assessment of building tax. The said exemption was in connection with the main building of the hospital.

6. On 16.07.2003, the then Tehsildar, Kottayam called the representatives of the appellant to ascertain as to whether exemption is available to the appellant under the Kerala Building Tax Act, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”). A person from the office of the Tehsildar, Kottayam visited the appellant hospital and stated that the appellant is liable to pay building tax.

7. Thereafter, the appellant filed a detailed representation stating that since it is a charitable institution engaged in charitable activities, the appellant has to be exempted from paying building tax.

8. On 27.02.2004, the appellant received a demand notice purportedly issued by the Assessing Authority by which the appellant was assessed to building tax under Sections 9(2) and 9(4) of the Act wherein building tax was assessed at an amount of [pic]24,77,700/- for a plinth area of 14826.63 Sq. meters to be paid by the appellant.

9. Aggrieved by the aforesaid orders dated 27.02.2004, the appellant filed Writ Petition(C)No. 9968 of 2004 before the High Court of Kerala.

By an order dated 02.04.2004, the learned single Judge of the High Court disposed of the writ petition directing the Tehsildar to reconsider the assessment in the light of the judgments of the High Court but rejected the request of the appellant to refer the issue relating to exemption to the Government under Section 3(2) of the Act. Against this rejection order the appellant filed a Writ Appeal No. 875 of 2004 before the High Court. The Division Bench of the High Court disposed of the writ appeal with a direction to the Tehsildar, Kottayam to refer the matter to the Government for deciding as to whether the building is entitled to get exemption from payment of building tax under Section 3(1) (b) of the Act.

10. By an order dated 01.11.2006, the Government of Kerala rejected the contention of the appellant that they are entitled to exemption under the Act as free medical service is given only in the plinth area of 448.40 Sq. mtrs. in the third floor of the main building and therefore only the said portion is exempt from paying building tax.

11. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the appellant filed a Writ Petition (C) No. 605 of 2007 before the High Court praying to quash the orders dated 01.11.2006 and 27.02.2004 and to declare the appellant to be a charitable institution under the Act. In the petition the appellant had annexed the audited income and expenditure account of the hospital as well as balance sheet for the years 2002 to 2005.

12. The learned single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that the building of the appellant is not used principally for charitable purposes. To arrive at the said conclusion the learned single Judge took into account the gross income of the appellant and compared the gross income vis-a-vis the amount spent on free medical aid and social work. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order the appellant filed a Writ Appeal No. 362 of 2007 before the Division Bench of the High Court. By an order dated 13.03.2009, the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the writ appeal by relying on two Division Bench decisions of the High Court in (1) Medical Trust Hospital (supra) and (2) Thirurangadi Muslim Orphanage Committee v. The Government of Kerala [W.P. (C) No. 4426 of 2009(B)] and held that as long as the appellant is a hospital run on chargeable basis it is not entitled to exemption.

13. Both the single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court interpreted the ‘Explanation’ Clause of Section 3(1) of the Act to hold that the buildings were not used principally for a charitable purpose as the medical services were not rendered free of charge to all patients, but only to those who could not afford it. The rest were charged a nominal fee for services at the Hospital. The explanation to Section 3 of the Act reads as under :

“For the purposes of this sub-section, “charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor and free medical aid.” The High Court, mainly relying on the Medical Trust case (supra) has held that since it has already been held by the Kerala High Court that charitable purpose means rendering medical relief ‘free of charge’ as per the Explanation clause to Section 3(1)(a) of the Act, the appellant was not entitled to exemption from paying building tax as they were charging nominal charges from patients who could afford it and was giving free services to those who could not.

14. The matter is in appeal before us. The learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Bechu Kurian has contended that the Division Bench has erred in relying upon the judgments in the Medical Trust case and the Thirurangadi Muslim Orphanage Committee case (supra) as the said judgments were rendered in the facts of those cases and no proposition of law has been laid down in the said decisions that if a hospital is run on chargeable basis it is not entitled to exemption. Further, it was contended that in the case of State of Kerala v. Gregorious Medical Mission[2], it was held that the fact that some amount is collected from the patients will not be sufficient reason to hold that the building can be excluded from the beneficial provisions contained in Section 3 of the Act if the hospital is intended for the relief of the sick without any motive for making profit. It was submitted that a perusal of the Memorandum of Association as well as the Rules and Regulations of the appellant hospital clearly shows that it has been set up solely for philanthropic purposes without any profit motive, and it also clearly states that in case the society running the hospital is wound up, the assets of the hospital shall go to any other charitable society having similar objects or to the Government. The counsel for the appellant has urged before us to consider that for any hospital to be able to provide free medical relief to poor patients, some income would have to be generated and it would otherwise be virtually impossible for any hospital to undertake free medical service. The counsel then went on to refer to the Income and Expenditure Account of the appellant hospital which shows that for the years 2002-03,2003-04 and 2004-05, the appellant has spent [pic]75.12 lakhs, [pic]78.39 lakhs and [pic]88.33 lakhs respectively for providing free medical services and for charity. For the said years, the net income of the appellant hospital has been [pic]4.2 lakhs, [pic]5.37 lakhs and [pic]8.33 lakhs respectively and it was submitted that the High Court ought to have compared the amount spent for free medical services vis-a-vis net income and not gross income which was what was done to hold that the buildings were not ‘used principally’ for the charitable purpose as required under Section 3(1)(b) of the Act. By doing this, it was contended that the various expenses for running the hospital were ignored.

15. The respondents, on the other hand, through learned senior counsel, Mr. C.S. Rajan, have contended that the appellant is not entitled for exemption from paying building tax as the hospital is making profit and hence cannot be considered a charitable institution. It was submitted that from the perusal of the accounts of the hospital, it is evident that the hospital authorities are not rendering any medical service free of cost and are making profit and is not running under ’no loss no profit’ basis as claimed. The purpose for which the building is used is the only relevant fact for determining whether the appellant is exempt from paying building tax and simply because the income derived from it is used for charitable purpose, it cannot be exempted from paying building tax. The counsel for the respondents relied on the Medical Trust case (supra) in order to show that charitable purpose means free medical relief as held in that case, and since the appellant is not providing free medical relief for all and is instead charging a nominal fee for those who can afford it, it cannot claim exemption from building tax.

16. We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the evidence on record and examined the rival legal and factual contentions. The following questions would arise for consideration : i. Whether the application of income derived from a building for charitable purpose is sufficient to hold that a building is used ‘principally’ for ‘charitable purpose’ as per Section 3(1)(b) of the Act in order to hold it exempt from paying building tax?

ii. Whether the Kerala High Court has correctly interpreted the ‘Explanation’ clause to Section 3(1) in the cases referred (supra) to hold that charitable purpose means solely ‘relief of the poor and free medical relief’?

iii. What order?

17. Answer to Question Nos. i & ii:

In our considered view, the High Court was correct in holding that the application of income derived from a building for charitable purposes does not amount to the building being ‘principally used’ for charitable purpose. In the present case, if we have to rule against the High Court’s judgment, it will be necessary to have more evidence with respect to details such as what the nominal charges are for patients who can afford it and the number of patients offered free medical care vis-a-vis the number of patients who pay for the services. The argument that the income is applied for charitable purposes can be accepted only if it is known what portion of the income goes into charity i.e. free medical services. Does the percentage of patients receiving free medical services increase every year? If we hold that the income derived from a building is applied for charitable purposes then that has to be clearly proved, and the fact that the institution is set up for charitable purposes as stated in its Memorandum of Association cannot be enough to hold that income is necessarily applied for charitable purposes, especially in the light of the fact that the patients who can afford to pay for it are being charged for medical services.

18. Now we will examine the question of what ‘charitable purpose’ means. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘charitable’ as “of or relating to the assistance of those in need”. In the present case, it can be argued that all medical services relate to the assistance of those in need. This is a valid interpretation but cannot be accepted for the purposes of tax. If these medical services in the present case were being offered free to a majority of the patients rather than a minority of patients, then the conclusion could have been reached that the buildings are principally used for charitable purposes. Further, an amount of approximately [pic]28,00,000/- of the expenses are towards ‘social work and charities’ as per the income and Expenditure Accounts provided, whereas ‘free medical aid’ is around [pic]60,00,000/- for the years 2004-05. It is not clearly mentioned what ‘social work and charities’ is. Furthermore, an exemption is provided for that area in which free medical aid is provided by the appellant-hospital. The appellant has not produced cogent material evidence before the competent authority or the State government or before the High Court to show that the entire building has been used for charitable purpose by rendering free medical aid to the needy, poor people of society. The fact is that the details furnished in the documents produced would go to show that the appellant hospital is earning money by charging from patients and therefore the claim of the appellant that the entire area taxed is used for charitable purpose is not reflected in the documents produced. Hence, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned orders. The High Court has correctly interpreted the ‘Explanation’ clause to Section 3(1) of the Act to hold that ‘charitable purpose’ means ‘relief of the poor and free medical relief’.

19. The tax herein is on the ‘building’. The society already has income tax exemption and the question here is whether the building is used principally for ‘charitable purpose’. Only the building utilized for providing free medical aid can be said to be used principally for charitable purpose and it will go against the letter of the law to grant building tax exemption for all the buildings of the hospital irrespective of what it is used for simply on the ground that the overall object of the hospital is charity although it is being predominantly run on a chargeable basis. In this case, the building used for providing free medical aid must be exempted from paying building tax.

20. In view of the foregoing, we uphold the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the appeal of the appellant-hospital, but without costs. The order dated 16.7.2009 of this Court granting stay shall stand vacated.",0
Laxmi Narain Modi,"We, in our order dated 23.8.2012, had highlighted the extreme necessity of constituting State Committees for the purpose of supervising and monitoring the implementation of the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Establishment and Registration of Societies for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) Rules, 2000, the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2000 etc.

2. We passed another order on 10.10.2012 and, following that order, almost all the States and Union Territories have constituted the State Committees. On 27.8.2013, we passed a detailed order directing those Committees to implement the broad framework prepared by the MoEF, which we have incorporated in the said order. We also directed the various State Committees to file an Action Taken Report. Few Committees have filed their Action Taken Reports.

3. We notice that there is no periodical supervision or inspection of the various slaughter houses functioning in various parts of the country. Action Taken Reports would indicate that, in many States, slaughter houses are functioning without any licence and even the licenced slaughter houses are also not following the various provisions as well as the guidelines issued by the MoEF, which we have already referred to in our earlier orders. We feel that the presence of an experienced Judicial Officer in the State Committees would give more life and light to the Committees, who can function as its Convener. The Convener, so appointed, would see that the Committees meet quite often and follow and implement the provisions of the Act as well as the guidelines issued by the MoEF, which has been made a part of our order dated 27.8.2013.

4. In such circumstances, we are inclined to request the Chief Justices of the various High Courts in the country to nominate the name of a retired District Judge for a period of two years as a Convener of the Committee so as to enable him to send the quarterly reports to this Court. First report be sent within two months. Communicate this order to the Chief Justices of the various High Courts in the country, along with a copy of this Court’s orders dated 23.8.2012, 10.10.2012 and 27.8.2013. We fix a consolidated remuneration of Rs.20,000/- per month as honorarium to be paid to the District Judge (Retd.), which will be borne by the respective State Governments/Union Territories, as the case may be. Union of India and various State Governments have raised no objection in adopting such course, so that the Committees could function efficiently and the provisions of the Act and the framework prepared by the MoEF could be given effect to in its letter and spirit",1
Ishwar Chandra Jayaswal,"Leave granted. These Appeals assail the Judgment dated 11.10.2010 of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.38190 of 2004 as well as the subsequent Order dated 28.3.2012 by which a Review Application in respect of the former was dismissed.

2. The Division Bench was confronted with the dismissal from service of the Appellant Dr. Ishwar Chandra Jayaswal against whom three Articles of Charge had been framed. Article-I was that he demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.26/- from Shri Pyare Ram, Khalasi for issuing in his favour a Fit Certificate. Article-II, in similar vein was that the Appellant demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.34/- from Shri Nandlal, Semi-skilled Revetter for issuing him a Fit Certificate. Article-III was that the Appellant had demanded and accepted Rs.18/- from Shri Balroop, Semi-skilled Revetter for issuing of Fit Certificate. The Inquiry Officer, after duly perusing the entire evidence, returned a finding that Charges 1 and 3 had been proved. The Disciplinary Authority, after considering the response of the Appellant, by its Order dated 22.1.1991 imposed the penalty of removal of the Appellant from service.

3. A Revision came to be filed which appears to have attracted the gravamen of challenge before the Division Bench. After considering the manner in which the Revision was heard and decided, the Division Bench in the impugned Order, has come to the conclusion that the President had decided the Revision in accordance with law.

4. In these proceedings, learned counsel for the Appellant has confined his arguments to the ground – “whether the punishment of removal of service of the petitioner on the alleged demand of meagre amount of Rs.18-45 is contrary to the doctrine of proportionality”.

5. It is now well settled that it is open to the Court, in all circumstances, to consider whether the punishment imposed on the delinquent workman or officer, as the case may be, is commensurate with the Articles of Charge levelled against him. There is a deluge of decisions on this question and we do not propose to travel beyond Union of India v. S.S. Ahluwalia (2007) 7 SCC 257 in which this Court had held that if the conscience of the Court is shocked as to the severity or inappropriateness of the punishment imposed, it can remand the matter back for fresh consideration to the Disciplinary Authority concerned. In that case, the punishment that had been imposed was the deduction of 10% from the pension for a period of one year. The High Court had set aside that order. In those premises, this Court did not think it expedient to remand the matter back to the Disciplinary Authority and instead approved the decision of the High Court.

6. The Appellant before us is presently 75 years of age. At the time when the Articles of Charge had been served upon him, he had already given the best part of his life to the service of the Respondent-Indian Railways. It has been contended before us that the three charges that have been sustained against the Appellant reflected only the tip of the iceberg; however, there is no material on record to substantiate this argument of Respondents. In the present case, the Appellant has served the Respondents for a period of twenty three years and removal from service for the two charges levelled against him shocks our judicial conscience. Part III of The Railway Servants (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1968 contains the penalties that can be imposed against a Railway servant, both Minor Penalties as well as Major Penalties. We have already noted that it has not been established that the Appellant had, as a matter of habit or on a wide scale, made illegal demands from Railway servants desirous of obtaining a Fit Certificate. However, since two of the three charges have been proved, we are of the considered opinion that the imposition of compulsory retirement i.e. Penalty 6(vii) would have better and more appropriately met the ends of justice. While this would have instilled sufficient degree of fear in the mind of the employees, it would also not have set at naught several years of service which the Appellant had already given to the Respondent-Indian Railways. We think that deprivation of retiral benefits in addition to loss of service is entirely incommensurate with the charge of the Appellant having taken very small sums of money for the issuance of Fit Certificate to other Railway employees.

7. It is in these premises that the Appeals are accepted and the impugned Order dated 11.10.2010 is set aside. The Appellant shall be deemed to have compulsorily retired under Part-III Penalty 6(vii) of the aforementioned Railway Rules with effect from 22.1.1991. If he is entitled to retiral or other benefits on the said date, the Respondents shall make necessary payment within three months from today. This decision is restricted to the facts of the present case.",1
"HARYANA DAIRY DEVELOPMENT COOPERATIVE
     FEDERATION LIMITED","Inspite of the fact that the Parliament has amended the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 altering the provisions of Section 102 CPC providing that money recovery suit involving less than Rs. 25,000/- shall not be entertained in Second Appeal, we are being burdened with cases where the litigation cost may be hundred times more than the amount involved. It has become the definite attitude of the officials not to take any responsibility even for petty issues and would waste public money approaching this Court. Government departments would spend any amount on litigation instead of paying petty amount to the other party. In the instant case, an amount of Rs. 8,724/- is to be paid to the respondent employee as reimbursement of his medical claim and the petitioner Haryana Dairy Development Cooperative Federation Limited treating the litigation as luxury must have spent the amount already by filing this petition more than the total amount involved herein.

Many a time this Court has felt unhappy about the time of the Court being taken for days together by petty matters. (The Constitution Bench judgment Sukhdev Singh, Oil & Natural Gas Commission, Life Insurance Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation Employees Associations Vs. Bhagat Ram, Association of Class II, Officers, Shyam Lal, Industrial Finance Corporation AIR 1975 SC 1331).

In Kadra Pahadiya and Others Vs. State of Bihar AIR 1997 SC 3750, this Court observed that if the load of such petty cases is taken out of the regular Courts, those Courts would have time to deal with more serious crimes rather than have their time consumed by such petty cases.

The Law Commission of India in its 155th report has observed that what further agitates is the number of pending litigations relating to trivial matters or petty claims, some of which has been hanging for more than fifteen years. It hardly needs mention that in many such cases money spent on litigation is far in excess of the stakes involved, besides wasting valuable time and energy of the concerned parties as well as the Court.

We direct that the expenses of the litigation shall be incurred by the Managing Director personally who has signed affidavit in support of the petition and it shall not be taken from the Federation. A copy of the order be sent to the learned Chief Secretary of the State of Haryana as well as to the Managing Director.

The special leave petition is dismissed. In view of the above, question of law, if any is kept open.",0
HANUMANAGOUDA,"Due to accident involving a goods vehicle, a lorry, two persons died and others received injuries. All the thirteen claim petitions were decided by a common judgment dated 21.01.2002 by the Motor Vehicle Accidents Claim Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as `The Tribunal’) presided by the Principal District Judge at Raichur (Karnataka). This appeal relates only to claim filed by dependents and legal representatives of deceased Hanumanth which included his widow Smt. Mariyamma and three minor children, who are respondents 2 to 4 in this appeal. The Tribunal allowed their claim in MCV No. 616 of 1999 and held them entitled for compensation of Rs.2,55,000/- from the owner-cum-driver of the lorry, the appellant and also from respondent-Insurance Company as they were held responsible jointly and severally. The claim was allowed with 6% interest from the date of claim petition till its realization with costs fixed at Rs.200/-.

3. In appeals preferred by the Insurance Company, the High Court by the order under Appeal dated 17.10.2005 interfered with the Award made against the Insurer in respect of death of Hanumanth and held that the Award was bad in law because the deceased was in a clerical cadre working as a Gumasthe accompanying the goods in transit for the purpose of delivery and as such he could not be covered by the clause under which premium was paid for covering the risk of the persons employed in connection with the operation of loading and unloading of the goods. Against this order passed in MFA No.2451 of 2002, the appellant/owner of the goods vehicle has preferred this appeal.

4. The only issue requiring determination is whether the clause IMT 17 for which premium was paid to the insurer in respect of the concerned lorry will cover the deceased Hamumanth or not.

5. For deciding the above issue, one is simply required to go through the relevant clause IMT 17 of the policy, whose copy has been made available to us. The clause reads thus:

“Add: for LL to persons employed in connection with the operation and/or loading unloading of motor vehicle IMT 17”.

6. The High Court has clearly fallen in error in holding that the insurer is not liable in respect of death of Hanumanth. The clause - “persons employed in connection with the operation” is clearly over and above the coverage provided by the policy to “persons employed in connection with loading/unloading of motor vehicle”. As Gumasthe, the deceased was accompanying the goods in transit for the purpose of delivery of goods. This has been accepted by the High Court. Obviously, as Gumasthe the deceased would be covered by the expression “persons employed in connection with operation of motor vehicle” The operation of the aforesaid clause has wrongly been restricted and limited only to persons employed in connection with loading/unloading of the motor vehicle.

7. In view of the aforesaid error committed by the High Court, the order under appeal is set aside and the order of the Tribunal is restored. As a result, the respondent-Insurance Company will be bound by the Award made by the Tribunal for paying compensation to the claimants for the death of Hanumath as per orders of the Tribunal. The dues of compensation along with due interest should be deposited by the respondent Insurance Company within eight weeks with the Tribunal which will permit the claimants to withdraw the amount as per order of the Tribunal.",1
Krishna Kanta Majhi & Ors,"We may point out that when the matter camp up for hearing on 03.12.2013, we were not inclined to disturb the admissions made in favour of the respondents, and passed an order on the said date directing the State of West Bengal to ascertain whether the seats are available so that the petitioners could be accommodated in the subject of their choice, without disturbing the admissions already made to the respondents.

We are informed by the State counsel that it would not be possible to accommodate the petitioners, especially, in the subject of their choice, without disturbing the admissions already made to the respondents. In such circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed accordingly.",0
"Major General H.M. Singh, VSM","The appellant was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the Indian Army on 15.6.1969. His initial induction was into the Armoured Corps. On 25.5.1983 the appellant changed his cadre. He permanently moved into the Defence Research and Development Organisation (hereinafter referred to as ‘the DRDO’). Having gone through decades of rigorous military service and having consistently earned onward promotions to higher ranks, as were due to him from time to time, he was granted acting rank of Major General on 1.6.2004, after he had been approved for promotion to the rank of Major General by a duly constituted Selection Board.

2. On 31.3.2005 Lieutenant General Ravinder Nath retired from service. Resultantly a vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General became available. On 1.1.2006 the appellant claims to have become eligible for the consideration for promotion to the above vacancy. It would be relevant to mention, that at that juncture, in the cadre of Major Generals, the appellant was the senior most serving officer (as per seniority list dated 29.12.2006) eligible for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. In the Government of India gazette (published on 6.12.2007) the appellant was shown as having been promoted as substantive Major General with effect from 7.1.2004. It would also be relevant to mention, that the name of the appellant was included in the name announced by the President of India for the award of the Vishist Seva Medal on 26.1.2007. The said award was sought to be bestowed upon the appellant, for his having rendered distinguished service of an exceptional order to the nation. It is therefore, that the appellant was desirous, that his claim be considered for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. At that juncture, the appellant had not only held the rank of Major General for more 18 months, he had also earned two confidential reports in the said rank. The record appended to the pleadings indicates, that he had also been granted vigilance clearance. Despite the above, the appellant was not considered eligible for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General as he had not completed two years’ service in the rank of Major General at that time.

3. Under the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, AVM R. Yadav, an officer from the Indian Air Force was inducted into the DRDO on 29.12.2005, against the vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General created by Lieutenant General Ravinder Nath. AVM R. Yadav retired from service with effect from 31.12.2006. As such, a vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General became available with effect from 1.1.2007.

4. On 30.4.2007, the appellant addressed a representation to the Director General DRDO asserting, that he was eligible for promotion against the existing vacancy of Lieutenant General, as he fulfilled the laid down criteria. He expressly pointed out in his above representation, that in the event of his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General his age of retirement would stand extended. As Major General he would retire at the age of 59 years, on 29.2.2008 (as the appellant date of birth is 2.2.1949). On his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General his age of retirement would stand extended to 28.2.2009 i.e., to 60 years. The appellant therefore requested the authorities, to immediately constitute and convene a meeting of the Selection Board, for considering his claim for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. For the above purpose, the appellant also met various higher authorities. On all such occasions he was informed, that the action to convene a meeting of the Selection Board was under process. In fact, in November, 2007 the appellant was assured, that the meeting of Selection Board would be held in December, 2007. He was also assured, that in the event of his being considered suitable for promotion by the Selection Board, he will actually be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, before the date of his retirement (29.2.2008) as Major General.

5. Since the date of appellant’s retirement – 29.2.2008 was fast- approaching, and because it seemed to the appellant that nothing was moving, the appellant submitted his grievance to the authorities in writing, praying for immediate action in the matter. In this behalf he also sought personal hearing, to present his case. These pleas were raised by the appellant through separate communications dated 26.12.2007 (to the SA to the Defence Minister, and to the DRDO). On 28.2.2008 he addressed a letter for the same purpose, to the Personal Secretary to the Defence Minister.

6. Two days prior to the appellant’s retirement on superannuation (29.2.2008, as Major General), on 27.2.2008 a meeting of the Selection Board for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was convened. The Selection Board cleared the appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. The Selection Board cleared only the name of the appellant for the above promotion, from out of a panel of 4 names.

7. In order to ensure that the appellant’s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General is not frustrated, the President of India by an order dated 29.2.2008, was pleased to grant the appellant extension of service, for a period of three months. A relevant extract of the above order is being reproduced hereinunder:

“I am directed to convey the sanction of the President to the grant of extension in service to IC-23289 Maj Gen H.M. Singh, VSM, AC, CVRDE, Avadi a permanently seconded officer of Defence Research & Development Organisation, for a period of three months with effect from 01 Mar 2008 or till the approval of ACC, whichever is earlier.
This issues with the concurrence of MOD/Fin(R&D) vide their Dy No. 582/Fin (R&D) dated 29 Feb 2008.” (emphasis is ours) A perusal of the above communication reveals, that the aforesaid extension of service was granted to the appellant, to await the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. In this behalf it would be relevant to mention, that in the process of consideration for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, the recommendation made by the Selection Board requires the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, before it is given effect to. It is apparent that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, could not finalise the matter during the appellant’s extended tenure of three months. As such, for the same reasons, the President of India was pleased to grant the appellant a further extension in service (as Major General) for a period of one month i.e., up to 30.6.2008 or till the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, whichever was earlier.

8. On 2.6.2008, the Secretariat of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training) issued a communication with the following observations:

“2. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has not approved the promotion of IC-23289 Maj Gen H.M. Singh, a permanently seconded officer of DRDO, to the rank of Lieutenant General.” In consonance with the order granting extension in service, the DRDO issued an order dated 3.6.2008, retiring the appellant from the rank of Major General with immediate effect. The appellant assailed the above order dated 2.6.2008 (denying the appellant promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General), and the order dated 3.6.2008 (by which the appellant was retired from service) by filing Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008 before the High Court of Judicature at Madras (hereinafter referred to as ‘the High Court’). Convening a meeting of the Selection Board on 27.2.2008 i.e., just two days before the appellant was to retire on attaining the age of superannuation, as also, the consideration of the recommendation made by the Selection Board at the hands of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, more than three months after the date on which the appellant would retire from service, were vigorously referred to, to demonstrate the apathy at the hands of the authorities, which according to the appellant, had resulted in denial of promotion to him.
9. In response to the alleged delay in the matter of considering the appellant’s claim for promotion, it was pointed out that the DRDO had a large number of high value projects viz. design, development and production of Light Combat Aircraft, design and development of Kaveri Engine, design and development of Airborne Early Warning System and a number of projects related to upgradation of avionics and electronics warfare system, Sukhoi, MIG-27 and LCA; accordingly a decision was taken by the DRDO i.e., the appellant’s controlling authority, to earmark the vacancy of Lieutenant General (against which the appellant was claiming consideration), for an officer of equivalent rank from the Indian Air Force, who would be in a position to oversee, provide guidance and coordinate all the abovementioned highly sensitive and intricate projects. The above tentative determination for filling up the vacancy of Lieutenant General from the Indian Air Force was, however, subsequently reviewed in consultation with the Government of India. The Government of India on 14.2.2008 finally decided to fill up the vacancy of Lieutenant General by promotion of a permanently seconded service officer of the DRDO. It was therefore asserted, that non-holding of the meeting of the Selection Board, and the non-finalisation of the consideration of the appellant’s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, could not be described as a deliberate and intentional attempt by the authorities to deprive the appellant of his promotional opportunity.

10. In its pleadings the Union of India adopt a clear stand, that the appellant having attained the age of superannuation on 29.2.2008, could not be promoted as Lieutenant General “while he was on extension”. It was also the contention of the Union of India, that since the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had not approved the appellant’s promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, the same could not be challenged specially because the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had given valid reasons to defer the recommendation of the Selection Board / Departmental Promotion Committee. The Union of India acknowledged, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was the competent authority to approve the recommendation for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General (made by the Selection Board). It was admitted, that the Selection Board in its meeting held on 27.2.2008 had recommended the appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Pending approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, the appellant had crossed the age of his retirement on superannuation (in the rank of Major General, on 29.2.2008). Thereafter, the appellant was granted extension in service beyond the period of his retirement up to 30.6.2008.

11. Having considered the contentions and prayers made by the appellant, a Single Bench of the High Court while disposing of the Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008, recorded the following observations:

“40. When the petitioner’s extension of service was not on the ground of exigency, DRDO being mainly civilian, Rules do not permit promotion on extension. ACC’s action in not granting approval to the recommendation made by Selection Board is in accordance with the Rules and the same cannot be assailed. Petitioner cannot contend that he has been discriminated in not granting promotion while on extension.
41. There is no substance in the contention that the Petitioner having been extended his service, he ought to have been granted promotion. Extension of service does not give rise the legitimate expectation for promotion. The extensions in tenure were given to the petitioner to ensure that procedure relating to approval of competent authority on the recommendation of Selection Board was completed in an objective manner by following prescribed process. On culmination of process, ACC is the competent authority came to the decision not to promote the petitioner. As such there is not incoherence and arbitrariness in the decision warranting exercise of judicial review.” In the light of the above observations Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008 was dismissed on 5.5.2009.

12. Dissatisfied with the dismissal of Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008, the appellant filed an intra court Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009. In the process of adjudicating upon the controversy raised in the abovementioned Writ Appeal, a Division Bench of the High Court framed two questions for its consideration. Firstly, whether the appellant Major General H.M. Singh had any fundamental right for promotion solely on the basis of the recommendation of the Selection Board. And secondly, whether Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was liable to accept the recommendation made by the Selection Board in favour of the appellant, and consequently, order the appellant’s promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Relying on paragraph 108 of the Regulation of Army which delineates the constitution and duties of the Selection Board, the Division Bench concluded that the recommendations of the Selection Board were merely recommendatory in nature, and therefore, answered the first question in the negative. The Division Bench further held, that a legitimate claim for the promotion would arise, only if a recommendation made by the Selection Board gets the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. Relying on the judgments rendered by this Court in Dr. H. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India and others, 1994 Supp. (1) SCC 250, Union of India and others Vs. N.P. Dhamania and others, 1995 Supp. (1) SCC 1, and Food Corporation of India and others Vs. Parashotam Das Bansal and others, (2008) 5 SCC 100, the Division Bench of the High Court further concluded, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was not bound by the recommendation of the Selection Board. It accordingly held, that for justifiable reasons, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had the right to either accept, or to refuse the recommendation of the Selection Board. In sum and substance it came to be concluded, that unless it was shown that the determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet suffered from arbitrariness or malafides and capriciousness, the same could not be interfered with. The Division Bench of the High Court having found none of the above noted vices in the determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, answered the second question also in the negative.

13. Based on its aforementioned determination, the High Court dismissed Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009, on 21.7.2009. Dissatisfied with the order dated 5.5.2009 (passed by the Single Judge of the High Court, dismissing Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2009), and the order dated 21.7.2009 (passed by the Division Bench of the High Court dismissing Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009), the appellant approached this Court by filing Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 2008 of 2010. On 11.1.2010 this Court issued notice in this matter. On completion of pleadings the matter was listed for final disposal.

14. Leave granted.

15. On 29.8.2013 while hearing the matter this Court passed the following order:

“Before we proceed for further hearing in the matter, we would like to go through the deliberations of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet [for short ‘the ACC’] by which the recommendations of the Selection Board was not accepted in the case of the petitioner.
Hence the records of the Selection Board and the final orders passed therein in the case of the petitioner be placed before the Court on the next date of hearing, i.e., 10th September, 2013.” Thereafter on 12.9.2013 this Court passed the following order:

“We have perused the record produced before us and we have also heard the arguments of learned Additional Solicitor General” Ld. A.S.G. has sought time to seek instructions.
On the next date, Ld. A.S.G. will ensure that a copy of the note put up to the A.C.C. and the decision of A.C.C. as well as a copy of the recommendation dated 27th February, 2008 of the Selection Board are made available to the Court List this matter on 23rd September, 2013.” The summoning of the record referred to in the orders extracted hereinabove, had become essential for two reasons. Firstly, the appellant did not contest the findings recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court on the two questions framed by the High Court, for the disposal of Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the determination rendered by the High Court, on the two questions framed by it, we must acknowledge that the High Court was fully justified in drawing its conclusions. We therefore hereby affirm the above findings recorded by the High Court. According to the appellant, the High Court had misdirected itself in its above determination. It was the submission of the appellant, that the determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, was not supported by justifiable reasons. It was asserted, that the determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was arbitrary, and based on extraneous consideration. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, it was the vehement submission of the appellant, that the High Court had not addressed the issue at all.

16. The solitary contention advanced at the hands of the appellant, was based on the recommendation made by the Selection Board on 27.2.2008, and the consideration of the above recommendation by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (leading to the rejection of the appellant’s claim for the promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General). For effectively understanding and determining the solitary contention at the hands of the appellant, it is essential to extract the minutes of the meeting of the Selection Board dated 27.2.2008, as also, the proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. Without understanding the tenor and effect of the above deliberations, it would not be possible to express our findings and the reasons. Had the above proceedings revealed sensitive material, improper for public consumption, or detrimental to national interest, we would have chosen to tread cautiously. The deliberations which resulted in denial of promotion to the appellant (to the rank of Lieutenant General), however, have no such misgivings. We have therefore no hesitation in extracting the minutes of the meeting of the Selection Board dated 27.2.2008. The same are being reproduced hereinunder:-

“MINUTES OF (1/2008) DRDO SELECTION BOARD MEETING HELD ON 27 FEB 2008 The Selection Board comprising the following, met on 27 Feb 08 in the office of the Scientific Advisor to Raksha Mantri, Room No. 532, DRDO Bhawan, New Delhi:-
           (a)   Shri M. Natarajan, SA to RM           - Chairman

           Secretary


2. Defence Secretary did not attend the meeting due to other prior commitments.
3. SA to RM briefed the Board to say that only one vacancy in the rank of Lt. Gen exists. The other vacancy in lieu of Scientist ‘H’ has been referred back to the RM for reconsideration and therefore will be considered only after a decision.
4. The Board considered the following 04 officers for promotion to the acting rank of Lt. Gen:-
           |Ser No. |IC No., Rank, Name & Corps                        |
|(i)     |MR-03539 Maj Gen J.K. Bansal, AMC                 |

|(iv)    |IC-24631 Maj Gen Umang Kapoor, EME                |


5. Based on deliberations and record of service, past performance, qualities of leadership as well as vision, the Board recommends IC-23289 Maj Gen HM Singh, VSM, AC for promotion.

                                                          (emphasis is ours)


The proceedings recorded by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet while rejecting the appellant’s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General are also being set out below:-
“The Ministry of Defence has, with the approval of the Raksha Mantri proposed the promotion of IC-23289 Maj Gen HM Singh, a permanently seconded officer of the DRDO, to the rank of Lieutenant General.
2. Maj Gen HM Singh (dob: 02.02.1949) was due for superannuation on 29th February, 2008 on attaining the age of 59 years which is the age of superannuation for officers of the rank of Major Generals who are permanently seconded to the DRDO. A Selection Board which met on 27th February, 2008 to consider eligible officers of the rank of Major General permanently seconded to the DRDO for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, recommended Major General Singh for promotion. As the officer was due for retirement on 29th February, 2008 approval of the Raksha Mantri was obtained for giving him extension of service of three months in the rank of Major General or till the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet to his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, whichever is earlier. Officers in the rank of Lieutenant General retire on attaining the age of 60 years.
3. The propriety of grant of extension to the officer at the verge of his superannuation and also, that of grant of promotion to the officer while on extension has been examined. The matter has been discussed, separately, with officers from the Department of Personnel and Training; the DRDO, and also, the Ministry of Defence (Military Secretary’s Branch). This apart, a legal notice has been received alleging perjury on the basis of information secured from the Ministry of Defence under the Right to Information Act. A representation has also been received from an officer, Maj Gen PP Das, alleging discrimination.
4. In terms of the provisions of Section 16A(4) of the Army Act an officer who has attained the age of retirement or has become due for such retirement on completion of his tenure, may be retained in the service for a further period by the Central Government, if the exigencies of the service so require.
5. It is evident from the above provisions that for grant of extension in service, the requirement to be fulfilled, primarily, is the exigencies of service. In the note which was put up to the Raksha Mantri soliciting approval to the proposal for grant of extension, no such exigency has been cited. The only issue that was mentioned in support of the proposal for extension was that the officer had been recommended for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. This in the background of the provisions of the Act mentioned above, is no sufficient ground for extension.
6. The Chief Controller Research & Development with whom the matter was discussed has provided copies of orders issued in the years 1995 and 1996 when officers of the rank of Major General were granted extensions. Extensions in service were granted with the approval of the Integrated Finance Division in the Ministry of Defence though approval of the finance angle is not strictly relevant to the grant of extensions. The other two instances cited are of Shri P. Venugopalan, Outstanding Scientist in the DRDL, Hyderabad who was granted extension pending a decision on the question of his regular extension under FR.56 as a Scientist; and of the post retirement appointment of Vice Admiral PC Bhasin on contract basis in the ATVP. These two cases are not relevant to the case of Maj Gen Singh, present under consideration.
7. An instance has been cited, during discussions, of extension of service granted in the year 1997 or thereabouts to Major General Malik who was due for superannuation, and his promotion to the rank of Lt. Gen while on extension.
8. The orders issued by the Department of Personnel and Training lay down that while extension could be granted in exceptional circumstances, there can be no promotion during the period of such extension. These orders apply to the civilian establishment. The instructions which apply to the Defence forces permit extension in service only if the exigencies so demand. DRDO is mainly civilian, and the Rules, as mentioned above, do not permit promotion on extension.
9. The above apart, the plea taken the representation of Maj Gen P.P. Das, and also the legal notice needs to be kept in view. Instances of officers in the Armed Forces retiring just before the vacancies coming their way and being denied empanelment are not uncommon. Extensions motivated by reasons of promotion being close at hand can have repercussions.
10. The above part, the ACR format which is followed for the officers of this rank, seconded to the DRDO, which has been applied for recording of ACRs in the present case reveal that fitness for promotion should be specifically recorded in the ACr. A perusal of the ACR of Maj Gen Singh reveals that specific record of fitness for promotion has not been made.
11. More pointedly, two questions stand out, firstly, the doubtful authority and grounds for granting extensions, taking into account that there was no exigency and, secondly, extensions, motivated by a promotion in the offing during the extension period cannot be allowed. It cannot be ignored also that such situations trigger litigation, which should best be avoided in such instances.
12. Under the above circumstances, it would be appropriate not to approve the promotion of Maj Gen H.M. Singh to the rank of Lieutenant General.

17. The appellant points out, that the determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, overlooked the factual position stated in the counter affidavit, filed jointly on behalf of respondent nos. 1 and 2 (respondent no.1 – the Union of India, through Secretariat of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet; and respondent no. 2 – the DRDO through its Director General). In this behalf our attention was drawn to paragraphs 3 (xvii) and 3 (xviii) which are being extracted below:
“3 (xvii) A meeting of the Selection Board was held on 27.2.2008 and the Selection Board recommended the name of the petitioner for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. The post of Lieutenant General then carried the pay scale of Rs.22400-525- 24500. Any appointment against this post requires the approval of Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) (Respondent No.1), which is a high power body consisting of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Hon’ble Union Home Minister, Hon’ble Union Minister of Department of Personnel and Hon’ble Union Defence Minister. As such, the recommendation of the Selection Board were sent to ACC. In DRDO, the retirement age of an officer of the rank of Maj Gen/equivalent which the petitioner held at that time is 59 years. The petitioner was due to retire from service w.e.f 29.2.2008. Under these circumstances, he was given an extension of service for a period of three months or till the decision of ACC was received whichever was earlier. As the decision of ACC was not received till 31.5.2008, his service was extended further for a period of one month w.e.f 1.6.2008 on the same terms and conditions.
3 (xviii) The decision of ACC (Respondent No.1) regarding non- approval of promotion of the petitioner to the rank of Lieutenant General communicated vide letter dated 2.6.2008 was received by respondent no. 2 on 3.6.2008 and the latter had to issue orders of the petitioner’s retirement from service from 3.6.2008.” (emphasis is ours)
18. Referring to the factual position depicted in the joint counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 and 2, it was the vehement submission of the appellant, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet exceeded its jurisdiction in examining the validity of the orders by which the appellant was granted extension in service. It was the submission of the appellant, that the only question before the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, consequent upon the recommendations made by the Selection Board on 27.2.2008, was in connection with the merits of the claim of the appellant, for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General.
Adding to the above contention, it was also the submission of the appellant, that the Selection Board, consequent upon its deliberations held on 27.2.2008, arrived at its findings based on the appellant’s service record, past performance, qualities of leadership, as well as, vision, that the appellant was worthy of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, during the course of its deliberations, did not find fault with the above conclusion drawn by the Selection Board. As such, it was sought to be asserted, that even the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet must be deemed to have endorsed the merit and suitability of the appellant, for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General.

19. In order to contest the submissions advanced at the hands of the appellant, learned senior counsel representing (respondent nos. 1 and 2) emphatically relied upon the proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. The proceedings under reference have been extracted by us hereinabove. Referring to the above proceedings, learned senior counsel for the respondents laid great emphasis on the observations recorded in paragraphs 8 and 9 thereof. It was pointed out, that in terms of the orders issued by the Department of Personnel and Training, promotion during the period of extension was unquestionably barred. In this behalf it was the contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondents, that with effect from 1.3.2008, the appellant (who had attained the age of retirement on superannuation on 29.2.2008), was on extension in service. There was, therefore, no question of his being considered for promotion during the period of such extension. In addition to the aforesaid categoric stand adopted by the learned senior counsel for the respondents, it was sought to be reiterated, that the orders dated 29.2.2008 and 30.5.2008, by which the appellant was granted extension in service, for periods of three months and one month respectively, were not sustainable in law, inasmuch as, they were in violation of Rule 16A of the Army Rules which postulates, that an officers who has attained the age of retirement or has become due for such retirement on completion of his tenure, may be retained in service for a further period by the Central Government, only if the exigencies of service so require. It was the submission of learned senior counsel for the respondents, that retention in service of the appellant was not on account of any exigency of service.

20. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the rival parties. First and foremost, we have no hesitation in endorsing the submission advanced at the hands of the appellant, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet did not in any manner upset the finding recorded by the Selection Board, in respect of the merit and suitability of the appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. On the instant aspect of the matter, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has maintained a sullen silence. Even in the pleadings filed on behalf of the respondents, there is an ironic quiescence. Therefore, all other issues apart, the appellant must be deemed to have been found suitable for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, even by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.

21. We have extracted hereinabove the factual position noticed by the respondents in paragraphs 3(xvii) and 3(xviii) of their counter affidavit. If the aforesaid averments are read in conjunction to the factual position, that the vacancy against which the claim of the appellant was considered, had arisen on 1.1.2007, it clearly emerges, that the appellant was the senior most eligible officer holding the rank of Major General whose name fell in the zone of consideration for promotion. The Selection Board having conducted its deliberations singularly chose the name of the appellant from the panel of four names before it. The proceedings of the Selection Board reveal, that its recommendations were based on record of service, past performance, qualities of leadership, as well as, vision. No other name besides the appellant’s name was recommended for promotion. Having been so recommended, the President of India, in the first instance, by an order dated 29.2.2008, extended the service of the appellant, for the period of three months with effect from 1.3.2008 “or till the approval of the ACC whichever is earlier”. Since the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet did not render its determination within the extended period expressed in the order dated 29.2.2008, yet another order to the same effect was issued by the President of India on 30.5.2008 extending the service of the appellant for a further period of one month with effect from 1.6.2008 “or till the approval of the ACC whichever is earlier”. The President of India, therefore, was conscious of the fact while granting extension in service to the appellant, the appellant’s case for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was under consideration. Therefore, to ensure that the aforesaid consideration fructified into a result one way or the other, extensions were granted to the appellant twice over. The aforesaid determination at the hands of the President of India in granting extension in service to the appellant, stands noticed in the factual position expressed in paragraphs 3(xvii) and 3(xviii) of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents 1 and 2. It is not possible for us to accept, that the aforesaid determination in allowing extension in service to the appellant can be described as being in violation of the norms stipulated in Rule 16A of the Army Rules. It is necessary in this behalf, for us to test the above conclusion drawn by us, on the touchstone of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It is not a matter of dispute, that the appellant was promoted to the rank of substantive Major General with effect from 7.1.2004. It is also not a matter of dispute, that the substantive vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General, against which the appellant was eligible for consideration, became available with effect from 1.1.2007. Even though the appellant had nearly 14 months of military service remaining at the aforesaid juncture, the procedure contemplated for making promotions to the rank of the Lieutenant General was initiated for the first time just two days before the date of retirement of the appellant, on 27.2.2008. Although it is the contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondents, that the delay in convening the Selection Board and conducting its proceedings was not deliberate or malafide, yet there can be no doubt about the fact, that the appellant was not responsible for such delay. For all intents and purposes, he was repeatedly seeking consideration orally as well as in writing. He had been repeatedly informing the authorities about the approaching date of his retirement. In response, he was always assured, that if found suitable, he would be actually promoted prior to the date of his retirement. It was for the respondents to convene the meeting of the Selection Board. Since the Selection Board came to be convened for the vacancy which had arisen on 1.1.2007 only on 27.2.2008, the respondents must squarely shoulder the blame and responsibility of the above delay.

22. The question that arises for consideration is, whether the non- consideration of the claim of the appellant would violate the fundamental rights vested in him under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The answer to the aforesaid query would be in the affirmative, subject to the condition, that the respondents were desirous of filling the vacancy of Lieutenant General, when it became available on 1.1.2007. The factual position depicted in the counter affidavit reveals, that the respondents indeed were desirous of filling up the said vacancy. In the above view of the matter, if the appellant was the senior most serving Major General eligible for consideration (which he undoubtedly was), he most definitely had the fundamental right of being considered against the above vacancy, and also the fundamental right of being promoted if he was adjudged suitable. Failing which, he would be deprived of his fundamental right of equality before the law, and equal protection of the laws, extended by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We are of the view, that it was in order to extend the benefit of the fundamental right enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, that he was allowed extension in service on two occasions, firstly by the Presidential order dated 29.2.2008, and thereafter, by a further Presidential order dated 30.5.2008. The above orders clearly depict, that the aforesaid extension in service was granted to the appellant for a period of three months (and for a further period of one month), or till the approval of the ACC, whichever is earlier. By the aforesaid orders, the respondents desired to treat the appellant justly, so as to enable him to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, (in case the recommendation made in his favour by the Selection Board was approved by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet), stands affirmed. The action of the authorities in depriving the appellant due consideration for promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant General, would have resulted in violation of his fundamental right under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Such an action at the hands of the respondents would unquestionably have been arbitrary. We are therefore of the view, firstly, that the order allowing extension in service of the appellant for a period of three months, dated 29.2.2008, and the order allowing further extension in service by one month to the appellant, dated 30.5.2008, so as to enable his claim to be considered for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, cannot be held to be in violation of the statutory provisions. Rule 16A of the Army Rules, postulates extension in service, if the exigencies of service so require. The said parameter must have been duly taken into consideration when the Presidential Orders dated 29.2.2008 and 30.5.2008 were passed. The respondents have neither revoked, nor sought revocation of the above orders. Therefore, it does not lie in the mouth of the respondents to question the veracity of the above orders. The above orders were passed to ensure due consideration of the appellant’s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Without rejecting the above claim on merits, the appellant was deprived of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Besides the above, we are also of the considered view, that consideration of the promotional claim of the senior most eligible officer, would also fall in the parameters of the rule providing for extension, if the exigencies of service so require. It would be a sad day if the armed forces decline to give effect to the legitimate expectations of the highest ranked armed forces personnel. Specially when, blame for delay in such consideration, rests squarely on the shoulders of the authorities themselves. This would lead to individual resentment, bitterness, displeasure and indignation. This could also undoubtedly lead to, outrage at the highest level of the armed forces. Surely, extension of service, for the purpose granted to the appellant, would most definitely fall within the realm of Rule 16A of the Army Rules, unless of course, individual resentment, bitterness, displeasure and indignation, of army personnel at the highest level is of no concern to the authorities. Or alternatively, the authorities would like to risk outrage at the highest level, rather than doing justice to a deserving officer. Reliance on Rule 16A, to deprive the appellant of promotion, to our mind, is just a lame excuse. Accordingly, extension in service granted to the appellant, for all intents and purposes, in our considered view, will be deemed to satisfy the parameters of exigency of service, stipulated in Rule 16A of the Army Rules.

23. While dealing with the issue of consideration of the appellant’s claim for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, it is necessary for us to also conclude by observing, that had the claim of the appellant not been duly considered against the vacancy for the post of Lieutenant General, which became available with effect from 1.1.2007, we would have had to hold, that the action was discriminatory. This because, of denial of due consideration to the appellant, who was the senior most eligible serving Major General, as against the claim of others who were junior to him. And specially when, the respondents desired to fill up the said vacancy, and also because, the vacancy had arisen when the appellant still had 14 months of remaining Army service. Surely it cannot be over looked, that the Selection Board had singularly recommended the name of the appellant for promotion, out of a panel of four names. In such an eventuality, we would have no other alternative but to strike down the action of the authorities as being discriminatory and violative of Article 16 of the Constitution of India.

24. The deliberations recorded by us hereinabove are incomplete, inasmuch as, we have not answered the pointed objection raised by the learned senior counsel for the respondent nos. 1 and 2, namely, that an officer is not entitled to promotion during the period of extension in service. For the instant objection raised at the hands of the respondents, it is necessary to refer to the deliberations of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, and specially paragraphs 8 and 9 thereof. A collective reading of the paragraphs 8 and 9 reveals an extremely relevant objective, namely, situations wherein an officer attains the age of retirement without there being a vacancy for his consideration to a higher rank, even though he is eligible for the same. Such an officer who is granted extension in service, cannot claim consideration for promotion, against a vacancy which has become available during the period of his extension in service. The above conclusion drawn by us is clearly apparent from the paragraph 9 of the proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. In fact in the operative part of the proceedings recorded in paragraph 11, it has been noticed, that .”…extensions motivated by a promotion in the offing during the extension period cannot be allowed…” We can derive only one meaning from the above observations, namely, extension being granted for promotion against a vacancy in the offing. That is to say, retention in service, so as to consider an officer for a vacancy which has not become available prior to his retirement, but is in the offing. The above reason recorded in the operative part of the proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, is laudible and legal. Insofar as the present controversy is concerned, there is no doubt whatsoever, that a clear vacancy against the rank of Lieutenant General became available with effect from 1.1.2007. At that juncture, the appellant had 14 months of service remaining. It is not as if the vacancy came into existence after the appellant had reached the age of retirement on superannuation. The present case is therefore, not covered by the technical plea canvassed at the hands of the learned senior counsel for the respondents. The denial of promotion to the appellant mainly for the reason, that the appellant was on extension in service, to our mind, is unsustainable besides being arbitrary, specially in the light of the fact, that the vacancy for which the appellant was clamouring consideration, became available, well before the date of his retirement on superannuation. We have, therefore, no hesitation in rejecting the basis on which the claim of the appellant for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was declined, by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.

25. In view of the fact, that we have found the order of rejection of the appellant’s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, on the ground that he was on extended service to be invalid, we hereby set aside the operative part of the order of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. It is also apparent, that the Selection Board had recommended the promotion of the appellant on the basis of his record of service, past performance, qualities of leadership, as well as, vision, out of a panel of four names. In its deliberations the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, did not record any reason to negate the aforesaid interference, relating to the merit and suitability of the appellant. We are therefore of the view, that the appellant deserves promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, from the date due to him. Ordered accordingly. On account of his promotion to the post of Lieutenant General, the appellant would also be entitled to continuation in service till the age of retirement on superannuation stipulated for Lieutenant Generals, i.e., till his having attained the age of 60 years. As such, the appellant shall be deemed to have been in service against the rank of Lieutenant General till 28.2.2009. Needless to mention, that the appellant would be entitled to all monetary benefits which would have been due to him, on account of his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General till his retirement on superannuation, as also, to revised retiral benefits which would have accrued to him on account of such promotion. The above monetary benefits shall be released to the appellant within three months from the date a certified copy of this order becomes available with the respondents.

26. Allowed in the aforesaid terms.",1
State of Rajasthan,"These are appeals by way of Special Leave under Article 136 of the Constitution against the judgment dated 21.11.2003 of the Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur Bench, setting aside the judgment of the trial court convicting the respondents of the offences punishable under Sections 366 and 376(2)(g) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ‘IPC’). Facts

2. The facts very briefly are that on 28.04.1999 Ruliram lodged a complaint at the Bhadra Police Station in District Hanumangarh, stating as follows: There was a marriage of the daughter of his brother Gyan Singh for which a feast was arranged by him on 27.04.1999. His 15-16 years old daughter, who was slightly weak- minded, disappeared. When she did not return for quite some time, he and others started searching her. At about 9.00 p.m., a milkman informed him that he had seen six boys taking away a girl towards Kalyan Bhoomi. About 1.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999, when Ruliram was on a scooter with Gyan Singh still looking for his daughter, he noticed five boys in the light of the scooter near the old dilapidated office building of the Sheep and Wool Department and all the five, seeing the light of the scooter fled. When they went into the old building, they found Akbar having sexual intercourse with his daughter and she was shouting. They caught hold of Akbar who later informed them that all the remaining five had also performed sexual intercourse with his daughter and they knew the remaining five persons. The police registered a case under Sections 147 and 376, IPC, and carried out investigation and filed a charge-sheet against the six respondents under Sections 376/34, IPC, and the case was committed for trial.

3. In the course of trial before the Additional Sessions Judge, Nohar Camp, Bhadra, the prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses. Ruliram was examined as PW-1, his daughter (prosecutrix) was examined as PW-2, and Dr. Ramlal, who had medically examined the prosecutrix, was examined as PW-7 and the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory was marked as Ext.P-39. The Additional Sessions Judge relied on the evidence of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-7 and the Ext.P- 39 and convicted the six respondents under Section 376(2)(g) and Section 366, IPC, by judgment dated 18.11.2000, and after hearing them on the question of sentence, sentenced them for rigorous imprisonment for ten years each and a fine of Rs.5,000/- each, in default a further sentence of two months rigorous imprisonment each for the offence under Section 376(2)(g), IPC, and rigorous imprisonment for four years each and a fine of Rs.3,000/- each, in default a further sentence of one month rigorous imprisonment each for the offence under Section 366, IPC. The Additional Sessions Judge, however, directed that the sentences for the two offences are to run concurrently and upon deposit of fine by the accused persons, a compensation of Rs.25,000/- be paid to the prosecutrix.

4. The respondents filed criminal appeals before the High Court and the High Court held in the impugned judgment that the deposition of the prosecutrix (PW-2) was not believable and the evidence of Dr. Ramlal (PW-7) did not corroborate the prosecution story in some respects. The High Court further held that the evidence given by Ruliram (PW-1) that the prosecutrix was only aged 14 years cannot be believed and that she could be aged up to 19 years and there were circumstances to suggest that she went with the respondents on her own. The High Court was also of the view that the delay on the part of Ruliram (PW-1) to lodge the FIR on 28.04.1999 at 11.00 a.m. when the incident came to his knowledge at 1.00 a.m. cast serious doubts on the prosecution case. The High Court accordingly set aside the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge, allowed the appeals and acquitted all the six respondents of the charges.

Contentions of learned counsel for the parties:

5. Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned counsel for the State submitted that the High Court should not have disbelieved the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 as there was no enmity between these witnesses and the accused persons. He referred to the evidence of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-7 as well as FSL report (Ext.P-39) to show that a case of gang rape by the six accused persons had been established beyond reasonable doubt. He further submitted that the High Court could not have held that there were circumstances to suggest that the prosecutrix could have gone on her own with the accused persons. He relied on Section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which provides that where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the question is whether it was without the consent of the woman alleged to have been raped and she states in her evidence before the Court that she did not consent, the Court shall presume that she did not consent. He submitted that the High Court has lost sight of this presumption under Section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act.

6. Dr. Singhvi next submitted that the High Court should not have entertained doubts about the prosecution story on the ground of delay in lodging the FIR. He submitted that no father would like to lodge a complaint making a false allegation of rape of his daughter. He relied on the decision of this Court in Balwant Singh and Others v. State of Punjab [(1987) 2 SCC 27] in which a similar contention that the father of the prosecutrix had lodged the FIR on account of previous enmity with the accused was rejected on the ground that a father of the proscutrix would not falsely involve his daughter in a case of rape by the accused.

7. Dr. Singhvi finally submitted that the prosecutrix in this case was a mentally deficient girl and was vulnerable to sexual abuse and, therefore, the High Court should have been sensitive while deciding the case. He cited the decisions of this Court in State of H.P. v. Gian Chand [(2001) 6 SCC 71] as well as in Tulshidas Kanolkar v. State of Goa [(2003) 8 SCC 590] in support of this submission. He submitted that in the present case the trial court had rightly convicted the respondents under Sections 366 and 376(2)(g), IPC but the High Court reversed the conviction of the respondents and acquitted them of the charges. He submitted that on almost similar facts this Court in State of Rajsthan v. N.K. [(2000) 5 SCC 30] has set aside the judgment of the High Court and restored the conviction of the accused persons by the trial court.

8. In reply, Mr. Mukesh Sharma, learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, submitted that Dr. Ramlal (PW-7) has not found any injury on the private parts of the prosecutrix and that he has found only some marks of eczema. He further submitted that PW-1 has only stated that with the help of the scooter light, he saw five persons running away but he has not been able to properly identify these five persons, namely, respondents Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. He submitted that as he had only found Akbar (respondent No.5) having sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix, no case of gang rape under Section 376(2)(g), IPC, is made out.

9. Mr. Sidharth Dave, amicus curiae for respondent No.5, submitted that the prosecution story that the prosecutrix was a mentally deficient girl has not been proved. He argued that, on the contrary, the doctor (PW-7) has opined that the mental condition and equilibrium of the prosecutrix were normal. He next submitted that the High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that the FIR was actually lodged at 11.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999 and had been ante timed to 6.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999. He argued that this manipulation casts serious doubts on the prosecution story that rape has been committed on the prosecutrix. He submitted that Dr. Ramlal (PW-7) has found on examination of the prosecutrix that there was one posterior perineal tear of the size 1/4” x 1/8” x 1/8” caused within 24 hours and had also given his opinion that this injury may result from the fall on some hard surface and, therefore, a case of rape by Akbar had not been established beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that the view taken by the High Court was a plausible one on the facts of this case and should not be interfered with an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. He relied on the judgment of this Court in State of Rajasthan vs. Shera Ram [(2012) 1 SCC 602] in support of this submission.

Findings of the Court

10. We have perused the evidence of informant (PW-1). He has stated that 28.04.1999 was the date of marriage of Manju, the daughter of his brother Gyan, and during dusk time on 27.04.1999, his daughter (the prosecutrix), who was 14 years old and not mentally balanced, had gone to call the ladies of the locality but did not return. He searched the entire village and thereafter he went on the scooter driven by his brother Gyan Singh towards village Rajpura and on the way a milkman told them that six boys catching the hand of a girl were taking her towards the cremation ground. They went searching for the prosecutrix in the cremation ground but did not find her there. Thereafter, they turned the scooter towards village Motipura and they found that five persons were standing in the cluster of keekar trees near the Bhedia Daftar (an old dilapidated building) and on seeing them, five persons fled away. When they went inside the dilapidated building they found that the prosecutrix was crying and Akbar was lying over her and having sexual intercourse with her. PW-1 has also stated that the five persons who fled away are Roshan, Jangsher, Yakoob, Shafi and Kadar. He has also said that all the aforesaid six persons are residents of his Mohalla (locality) and were present in Court. PW-1 has further stated that by the time they reached the Bhedia Daftar, it was about 1.00 a.m. of 28.04.1999 and he took the prosecutrix and Akbar to the Police Station and submitted the complaint (Ext.P-1) at 6.00 a.m. of 28.04.1999.

11. We have also perused the evidence of prosecutrix (PW-2). She has stated that when the marriage of the daughter of his uncle Gyan was to take place, she had gone out at dusk time from her house to call ladies to sing songs and on the way she met Akbar who told her that her uncle was looking for her. Then she accompanied with Akbar proceeded further and met Jangsher near the railway crossing who also told her that her uncle was looking for her. She then started walking and Akbar and Jangsher followed her and after some time she found Shafi and Yakoob and all the four persons started following her and after some time she saw Kadar and Roshan and all the six persons took her to a bridge on the road and from there they brought her to the tree of Tali in the field. Thereafter, all the six persons made her fall beneath the Tali tree forcibly and removed her salwar, caught hold of her and took her to a distance of two-three fields and then to a hut. Then they took her to Bhedia Daftar where also they committed sexual intercourse with her and when Akbar was committing rape on her, PW-1 and her uncle came and the remaining five persons fled away. She has stated that all these six accused persons belong to her Mohalla (locality) and they were present in Court. She has also identified six accused persons in Court. She has categorically stated that all the six persons committed rape on her without her consent and forcibly.

12. We have also read the evidence of Dr. Ramlal (PW-7) He has stated that he has examined the prosecutrix and prepared the medical examination report (Ext.P-15) and he had not found any mark of injury on her hidden parts, breast, thighs and forearm. He has further stated that her hymen was already ruptured and there was one posterior perineal tear of the size 1/4” x 1/8” x 1/8” caused within 24 hours. His opinion is that prosecutrix was habitual to sexual intercourse and there was nothing to suggest that she had not been raped but the vaginal swab and smear slides could be tested to find out the presence of sperms. PW-7 has also examined all the six accused persons and also stated that their pants and underwears were taken into possession and sealed and delivered to the SHO, Bhadara. The SHO, Bhadara, has been examined as PW-9 and he has stated that he handed over the pieces of medical evidence received from the Medical Officer of Govt. Hospital, Bhadara to the in-charge of the Malkhana and later on he got all such evidence in eight packets sent to the FSL, Rajasthan for test and the FSL, Rajasthan, submitted the test report (Ext.P-39).

13. Ext. P-39, which is the report under Section 293, Cr.P.C. of the FSL, Rajasthan, gives the following descriptions of the articles and result of examination:

“Description of Articles |Packet Parcel No. |Exhibit No. marked by|Details of exhibits | | |me | | |A. |1 |Vaginal Swab | |“ |2 |Vaginal smear | |B. |3 |Salwar | |“ |4 |Kameej | |1. |5 |Pants | |2. |6 |Pants | |“ |7 |Underwear | |3. |8 |Pants | |4. |9 |Pants | |“ |10 |Underwear | |5. |11 |Pants | |“ |12 |Underwear | |A. |13 |Underwear | Result of Examination Human semen was detected in exhibit No.1, 2 (from packet marked A), 3, 4 (from B), 5 (from 1), 7 (from 2), 8 (from 3) & 10 (from 4).

Semen was not detected in exhibit No.6 (from 2), 9 (from 4), 11, 12 (from

5) & 13 (from A).

Exhibit No.1, 2 (from A) have been consumed during the examination.

(Dr. PRABHA SHARMA)”

14. Thus, the evidence of the prosecutrix (PW-2) is clear that all the six respondents, Akbar, Jangsher, Roshan, Yakoob, Kadar and Shafi, committed rape on her without her consent and forcibly. This evidence of the prosecutrix (PW-2) is also corroborated by the evidence of the informant (PW-1), who had himself witnessed Akbar committing rape on the prosecutrix. PW-2 had also informed PW-1 soon after the rape by the accused persons that not only Akbar but the other five respondents also had forcibly committed rape on her. The evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 that all the six respondents had committed rape on the prosecutrix is also corroborated by the complaint (Ext.P-1) made by PW-1 to the police within a few hours of the incident as provided in Section 157 of the Indian Evidence Act. Dr. Ramlal (PW-7) has opined after medically examining the prosecutrix that there was nothing to suggest that she had not been raped. To confirm whether rape was committed on the prosecutrix by the six accused persons, the vaginal swab and vaginal smear as well as salwar and kameej of the prosecutrix and the pants and underwears of the accused persons were sent by the letter (Ext.P-31) to the FSL, Rajasthan, and as per the report of the FSL, Rajasthan (Ext.P-39), human semen was detected in the vaginal swab and vaginal smear (Exts.1 & 2 from packet ‘A’), salwar and kameej of the prosecutrix (Exts.3 & 4 from packet ‘B’), two pants (Ext.5 from packet 1, and Ext. 8 from packet 3) and two underwears (Ext.7 from packet 2, and Ext.10 from packet 4). The medical evidence, therefore, also corroborates the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 that there was sexual intercourse between the prosecutrix and the accused persons.

15. We cannot accept the submission of Mr. Siddharth Dave, learned amicus curiae for respondent No.5 that the finding given by the High Court that the prosecutrix may have gone with the accused persons on her own is a plausible one and should not be interfered with under Article 136 of the Constitution. As we have already noticed, the prosecutrix (PW-2) has deposed categorically that all the six persons had raped her without her consent and forcibly. Section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 clearly provides that in a prosecution for rape under clause (g) of sub-section (2) of Section 376, IPC, where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the question is whether it was without the consent of the woman alleged to have been raped and she states in her evidence before the Court that she did not consent, the Court shall presume that she did not consent. Since the prosecutrix (PW-

2) has categorically said that sexual intercourse was committed by the accused without her consent and forcibly, the Court has to draw the presumption that she did not give consent to the sexual intercourse committed on her by the accused persons. The defence has not led any evidence to rebut this presumption. In our considered opinion, the High Court could not have, therefore, held that there were circumstances to show that PW-2 had gone on her own and on this ground acquitted the respondents.

16. From Ext.P-31 read with Ext.P-39, it is also clear that human semen was detected from the pants of Akbar and Jangsher and the underwears of Safi and Yakub. As per the medical evidence, four persons had committed rape on the prosecutrix. Explanation 1 to Section 376(2)(g), IPC, states that where a woman is raped by one or more in a group of persons acting in furtherance of their common intention, each of the persons shall be deemed to have committed gang rape within the meaning of the sub-section. This Court has, therefore, consistently held that where there are more than one person acting in furtherance of their common intention of committing rape on a victim, it is not necessary that the prosecution should adduce clinching proof of a completed act of rape by each one of the accused on the victim. (see Om Prakash v. State of Haryana [(2011) 14 SCC 309], Ashok Kumar v. State of Haryana [(2003) 2 SCC 143], Bhupinder Sharma v. State of H.P. [(2003) 8 SCC 551], Pardeep Kumar v. Union Admn. [(2006) 10 SCC 608] and Priya Patel v. State of M.P. [(2006) 6 SCC 263]). Thus, we cannot accept the submissions of Mr. Mukesh Sharma, learned counsel for respondent nos.1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, and Mr. Siddharth Dave, learned amicus curiae for respondent No.5, that the medical evidence do not establish a case of gang rape under Section 376(2)(g), IPC.

17. The High Court, however, has considered the delay on the part of informant (PW-1) to lodge the FIR as a relevant factor to doubt the prosecution story. We find that PW-1 has explained the delay in his evidence. He has stated that after he found his daughter at about 1.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999 at the Bhedia Daftar with Akbar and after the five other accused persons had fled, they returned to their house at 2.00 a.m. and remained at their house till before sunrise and thereafter lodged the FIR at the Police Station. He has further stated that the delay from 2.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m. in lodging the report was on account of the fact that his wife was sick and he was also frightened and there was no other person to go to the police station. He has also stated that he returned home from the police station at about 9.00 a.m. The SHO of Bhadara Police Station has in his evidence stated that on 28.04.1999 the informant appeared in the police station and produced a written report (Ext.P-1) before him. In cross- examination on behalf of the accused-Roshan, Shafi and Yakoob, PW- 9 has stated that Ext.P-1 was produced before him at 6.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999. Yet the High Court has come to the conclusion that the report (Ext.P-1) must have been filed at about 11.15 am. and was ante timed to 6.00 a.m. For this conclusion, we do not find any evidence, but only a surmise that Ext.P-1 must have been typed at the court premises after 11.00 a.m. Thus, the report (Ext.P-1) was filed by PW-1 at 6.00 a.m. in the morning reporting an incident that he had witnessed between 1.00 a.m. and 2.00 a.m. on 28.04.1999 and the period from 2.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m., in our considered opinion, has been sufficiently explained by PW-1 in his evidence that he could not leave his wife alone until sunrise. As has been rightly submitted by Dr. Singhvi, no father would lodge a false complaint that his daughter has been gang-raped. The High Court should not have doubted the prosecution story on the ground of delay in lodging the FIR.

18. The judgment of the High Court is thus contrary to the evidence on record and is liable to be set aside. We accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court acquitting the respondents and restore the judgment of the trial court convicting the respondents for the offences under Sections 366 and 376(2)(g), IPC, and maintain the sentences imposed for the two offences on the respondents by the trial court.

19. The appeals are accordingly allowed. The respondents will be taken into custody forthwith to undergo the remaining sentence.",1
Tulip Star Hotels Ltd,"In these two appeals, the challenge is to a common judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in FEMA Appeal Nos.3 & 4 of 2008, dated 14th October 2010.

3. Brief Facts which led to the culmination of the present appeals are required to be stated. The Appellant in SLP No.7655 of 2011 is the company and the Appellant in SLP No.7657 of 2011 was also proceeded against as the Executive Director of the company. The Respondent issued a show cause notice against the Appellants dated 29th April 2002, wherein it was alleged that the Appellant in SLP No.7655 of 2011 sold foreign currency to the value of 1,47,000 US$ and 1000 Sterling £ of UK between 29.4.1997 to 5.6.1997 through unauthorized persons deputed by M/s Hotel Zam Zam in violation of Sections 6(4), 6(5), 7 & 8 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (hereinafter called “FERA”) as well as paragraph 3 of the Memorandum of FLM issued by RBI. The Appellants were called upon to show-cause why penalty should not be imposed against them under Section 50 of FERA read with Section 49 (3) & (4) of Foreign Exchange Management Act (hereinafter called “FEMA”). Subsequently, by order dated 28.10.2004 the Respondent imposed a penalty of Rs.50,000/- each on both the Appellants. The Appellants preferred appeals before the Appellate Tribunal for Foreign Exchange in Appeal Nos.1259 and 1260 of 2004, which were also dismissed by order dated 2.7.2008. The above said orders of the Original Authority, as well as the Appellate Authority, were the subject matter of challenge before the Division Bench of the High Court in FEMA Appeal Nos.3 & 4 of 2008. The Division Bench having confirmed the orders of the lower authority, as well as the tribunal, the Appellants have come forward with these appeals.

4. We heard Mr. H.N. Salve, learned Senior Advocate for the Appellants and Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned Addl. Solicitor General for the Respondent. We also perused the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant as well as the respondent. We also perused the order of the Original Authority, the Tribunal, as well as the Division Bench and having heard the counsel for the respective parties we proceed to decide these appeals.

5. Mr. Salve, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the Appellants in his submissions mainly contended that there was no violation at all in the matter of Sale and Purchase by the Appellant company to M/s Hotel Zam Zam in relation to the sale of 1,47,000 US$, as well as 1000 Sterling £ of UK in between 29.4.1997 and 5.6.1997, inasmuch as both the Appellant company, as well as M/s Hotel Zam Zam are duly licensed Full Fledged Money Changers, in short FFMC. According to the learned senior counsel, such transactions as between the licensed FFMCs are wholly authorized under the provisions of FERA, as well as the Memorandum of FLM of the Reserve Bank of India. The learned senior counsel further contended that in the confiscation proceedings initiated against the Appellants, as well as M/s Hotel Zam Zam, as per the order dated 21.8.1998 it was found that no statutory violation can be attributed to the Appellants and therefore, the imposition of penalty as against the Appellants by the Original Authority and the confirmation of the same by the Tribunal and the Division Bench are therefore liable to be set aside.

6. As against the above submissions, Mr. Bagaria, learned Addl. Solicitor General would contend that by virtue of the statutory stipulations contained in sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 6, Section 7 and 8 of FERA read along with paragraph 3 of the Memorandum of FLM of the RBI, there was a clear violation of the statutory provisions committed by the Appellants, hence the penalty imposed by the Original Authority as confirmed by the Appellate Authority, as well as the High Court cannot be faulted. It was also submitted that the Original Authority, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court have reached a concurrent finding based on documents, materials, as well as statements on record and the said conclusions are not perverse and therefore, the same do not call for interference. Reliance was placed upon the decisions in Collector of Customs vs. Swastic Woollens Pvt. Ltd. - 1988 (Supp) SCC 796, Commissioner of Central Excise vs. Charminar Non-Wovens Ltd. – (2009) 10 SCC 770 and Ghisalal vs. Dhapubai (dead) by LRs & Ors. – (2011) 2 SCC

298. It was also contended that Hotel Zam Zam purchased the foreign exchange from the appellant at a higher rate than the exchange rate fixed by the RBI and on this ground as well the proceedings initiated against the appellant and the imposition of penalty was justified. To support the said contention, reliance was placed upon the decision in P.V. Mohammad Barmay Sons vs. Director of Enforcement – 1992 (61) ELT 337.

7. When we consider the submissions of the respective counsel we find Sections 6(4), 6(5), 8(2) of FERA and Para 3 and 9 of the Memorandum of FLM of RBI, are required to be noted which are as under:

“Section 6 Authorised dealers in foreign exchange:-

6(4) An authorized dealer shall, in all his dealings in foreign exchange and in the exercise and discharge of the powers and of the functions delegated to him under Section 74, comply with such general or special directions or instructions as the Reserve Bank may, from time to time, think fit to give, and except with the previous permission of the Reserve Bank, an authorized dealer shall not engage in any transaction involving any foreign exchange which is not in conformity with the terms of his authorization under this section.

6(5) An authorized dealer shall, before undertaking any transaction in foreign exchange on behalf of any person, require that person to make such declaration and to give such information as will reasonably satisfy him that the transaction will not involve, and is not designed for the purpose of, any contravention or evasion of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, notification, direction or order made thereunder, and where the said person refuses to comply with any such requirement or makes only unsatisfactory compliance therewith, the authorized dealer shall refuse to undertake the transaction and shall, if he has reason to believe that any such contravention or evasion as aforesaid is contemplated by the person report the matter to the Reserve Bank.

Section 8: Restrictions on dealings in foreign exchange:-

(2) Except with the previous general or special permission of the Reserve Bank, no person, whether an authorized dealer or a money- changer or otherwise, shall enter into any transaction which provides for the conversion of Indian currency into foreign currency or foreign currency into Indian currency at rates of exchange other than the rates for the time being authorized by the Reserve Bank.

Paragraphs 3 and 9 of the FLM Authorised Officials

3. All money-changers should arrange to forward lists giving full names and designations of their representatives who are authorized to buy and sell foreign currency notes, coins and travelers cheques on their behalf together with their specimen signatures, at the end of each calendar year to the office of Reserve Bank under whose jurisdiction they are functioning. Any changes in their list should also be brought to the notice of Reserve Bank. No person other than the authorized representative should be allowed to transact money- changing business on behalf of the money-changer Purchases from other Money-changers and Authorized Dealers:-

9. Money-changers may freely purchase from other money-changers and authorized dealers in foreign exchange or their exchange bureau, any foreign currency notes and coins tendered by the letter. Rupee equivalent of the amount of foreign currency purchased should, however, be paid by way of a cross cheque drawn on their bank account or if made by way of a bankers’ cheque/pay order/demand draft, it should be accompanied by a certificate from the bank issuing the relative instrument certifying that the funds for the instrument have been received by it by debit to the applicants bank account. In no circumstances should payments in respect of such sale be made in cash.”

8. Under Section 6(4) it is stipulated that a full fledged money changer (FFMC) as an authorized dealer in foreign exchange should strictly comply with the general or special directions or instructions that may be issued by the RBI and that except with the previous permission of the RBI, authorized dealers should not engage in any transaction involved in any foreign exchange, which is not in conformity with the terms of his authorization. Under Section 6(5) it is stipulated that an authorized dealer should before undertaking any transaction in foreign exchange should ensure verification on certain aspects in order to ensure that there is no contravention of the provisions of FERA and if the FFMC has any reason to believe that any such contravention or evasion is contemplated by a person who seeks to indulge in any transaction in foreign exchange, the FFMC should report the matter to the RBI.

9. Section 8 of FERA imposes restrictions on dealings in foreign exchange. The said provision imposes restriction to the effect that no person other than the authorized dealer in India, shall purchase or otherwise acquire or borrow any foreign exchange. Under sub section 2, it is stipulated that except with the previous general or special permission of RBI, an authorized dealer or a money changer should enter into any transaction providing conversion of Indian currency into foreign currency or vice versa, at rates of exchange other than the rates for the time-being authorized by RBI.

10. De hors the above provisions, the other relevant provisions are paragraphs 3 & 9 of the Memorandum of FLM issued by the RBI. A close scrutiny of paragraph 3 disclose that the said paragraph has been issued by the RBI to state as to who can be called as ‘authorized officials’ of money changers. The said paragraph also imposes a restriction to the effect that other than an authorized representative, nobody else should be allowed to transact money changing business on behalf of the money changer.

11. Paragraph 9 virtually gives a free hand for the money changers to indulge in purchase of foreign currency etc., and the only restriction is that while making such purchase, the purchase value should be paid only by way of an instrument and not by way of cash.

12. Keeping the above provisions in mind, when we refer to the nature of transaction that had taken place as between the Appellants and M/s Hotel Zam Zam, the following facts are not in controversy:

a) The Appellants, as well as M/s Hotel Zam Zam, are licensed FFMC.
b) The Appellants sold foreign exchange of 1,47,000 US $ and 1,000/- sterling £ of UK as between April 1997 to June 1997 to M/s Hotel Zam Zam.
c) The purchase value of the above foreign currency was at a higher rate than the existing retail rate that prevailed in the market.
d) The purchase value was paid by M/s Hotel Zam Zam by way of Pay Orders.
e) Prior to the transaction, at the instance of the Appellants, a Xerox copy of the RBI license of M/s Hotel Zam Zam was produced and based on which the transaction was effected.
f) The transactions were effected on 29.04.1997, 06.05.1997, 29.05.1997 and 05.06.1997 and the amounts transacted were 7,000 US$, 1000 Sterling £ of UK, 40,000 US$ and 1,00,000 US$ on the respective dates. In all 1,47,000 US$ and 1000 Sterling £ of UK were sold by the Appellants to M/s Hotel Zam Zam.
g) All the above transactions were made and the foreign currency was handed over to Shri Rakesh Mahatre, a representative of M/s Hotel Zam Zam.
13. Based on the above undisputed facts relating to the transaction as between the Appellants and M/s Hotel Zam Zam, the Original Authority reached a conclusion that the Appellants failed to verify the authorization in favour of the persons concerned to buy/sell foreign exchange on behalf of the said money changers as contemplated under the relevant provisions. In other words, it was concluded that it was incumbent upon the Appellants by virtue of the terms of instructions contained in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum of FLM issued by RBI to have verified the bonafides of the persons deputed to them by M/s Hotel Zam Zam before handing over the foreign currencies to such persons. It was, therefore, ultimately concluded that the said failure on the part of the Appellants resulted in contravention of the directions contained in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum of FLM read with Section 6(4), 6(5) and 7 of FERA. Ultimately the Appellants were found guilty for the said contraventions and the penalty came to be imposed. The said order of the Original Authority was confirmed by the Tribunal, as well as the Division Bench of the High Court.

14. The above impugned orders disclose that the only violation or contravention related to the stipulations contained in paragraph 3 read with Section 6(4) and 6(5) of FERA. It will be relevant to note that the variation in the rates of purchase value of the foreign currency was not the basis for the ultimate conclusion about the contravention held against the Appellants. Therefore, keeping aside the said aspect, when we examine the contravention held proved against the Appellants, we feel it appropriate to make a reference to paragraph 9 in the forefront. Under paragraph 9 of the FLM as between the money changers, a free hand has been given for purchase and sale of any foreign currency notes etc. in rupee value. The only restriction imposed therein is that the Indian rupee value of the foreign currency should not be paid by way of cash, but should always be paid in the form of an instrument such as banker’s cheque/pay-order/demand draft etc., or by debiting to the purchasers’ bank account. Therefore, if under paragraph 9 such a free hand has been given to the money changers, namely, FFMCs in the matter of purchase of foreign currency etc., by making payments in the form of negotiable instruments under the relevant statutes, the question that would arise for consideration would be whether in a case of this nature where such a transaction had taken place in between two licensed FFMCs and the said transaction was carried on by exchange of foreign currency by way of payment in the form of pay-orders and that the sale effected by the Appellants and the purchase made by the other FFMC, namely, M/s Hotel Zam Zam was not disputed, can it still be held that there was any violation at all in order to proceed against the Appellants for imposing a penalty? When we examine the said issue, we are unable to accede or countenance the stand of the Respondent that the foreign currencies to the values mentioned in the earlier paragraphs were handed over to the representative of M/s Hotel Zam Zam by one Mr. Rakesh Mahatre and, therefore, the whole transaction was in contravention of Sections 6(4) and 6(5) of FERA and paragraph 3 of FLM.

15. When we examine paragraph 3 of FLM, we find that the caption of the said paragraph is “Authorized Officials”. The purport of the said paragraph was to ensure that any licensed money changers should allow transaction of its money changing business in its premises only through such persons who are the listed authorized officials as certified by the office of the Reserve Bank under whose jurisdiction such money changers operate their business. The last part of paragraph 3 makes the position a little more clear which states that “no person other than the authorized representative should be allowed to transact money-changing business on behalf of the money-changer”. Apparently when a money changer operates its business from its premises, any transaction by way of sale or purchase as part of its money changing business should be carried out only through an authorized representative.

16. When we extend the application of the said stipulation to the case of present nature, it can only be said that if such transaction had taken place as between the Appellants and the purchaser M/s Hotel Zam Zam, it should have been carried on only through their respective authorized representatives. The statement of Mr. Peter Kerkar, the Appellant in SLP (C) No.7657 of 2011, disclose that on each occasion the transaction was negotiated by the Branch Manager of the Appellant with one Ms. Pinky of M/s Hotel Zam Zam. It is not the case of the Respondent that neither of these two persons who indulged in the transaction of money changing business were not the authorized officials of their respective establishments. If the said factum relating to the business transactions, which had taken place as between the Appellants and M/s Hotel Zam Zam is not in controversy, we fail to see how a violation of paragraph 3 can be alleged as against the Appellants.

17. It is stated that after the transaction as between the Appellants and M/s Hotel Zam Zam concluded, M/s Hotel Zam Zam stated to have indulged in some transaction, which was in violation of the provisions of FERA with which the Appellants were not in any way concerned. It can also be safely held that for any violation or contravention of the provisions of FERA or FEMA at the instance of M/s Hotel Zam Zam after the money changing transaction as between the Appellants and the said concern had come to an end, the Appellants cannot in any way be held responsible or proceeded against.

18. In our considered opinion that in the peculiar facts of this case and having regard to the nature of transactions which had taken place as between the Appellants and M/s Hotel Zam Zam in the manner in which it has been narrated in the impugned order of the Original Authority as noted by the Tribunal, as well as the Division Bench of the High Court, we are convinced that there was no scope to allege a violation of paragraph 3 of the FLM or for that matter Sections 6(4) and 6(5) of FERA, 1973. Based on the interpretation of Sections 6(4), 6(5) of FERA, 1973 and paragraphs 3 & 9 of the FLM, we have held that the Original Authority, the Appellate Tribunal as well as the Division Bench of the High Court failed to appreciate the issue in the proper perspective while holding the appellant guilty of the violation alleged. Therefore, none of the judgments relied upon by the respondents for the proposition that concurrent findings of fact should not be interfered with does not apply to the facts of this case.

19. Once we steer clear of the above position, we come to the question of the higher value at which the foreign currency was alleged to have been sold by the Appellants to M/s Hotel Zam Zam. As pointed out by us earlier, the said act was not the basis for the contravention and imposition of the penalty as against the Appellants. To rule out any controversy, the conclusion of the Original Authority as recorded in its order for finding the Appellants guilty of paragraph 3 of the FLM read with Sections 6(4), 6(5) and 7 of FERA, can be usefully extracted which reads as under:

“…….Thus by not insisting on the authorization from the said Hotel Zam Zam disclosing the names, address and other particulars of the persons deputed by them for purchasing foreign exchange from M/s Cox and Kings Travel & Finance Ltd., the said M/s Cox and Kings Travel & Finance Ltd. has contravened the directions contained in para 3 of the Memorandum FLM R/w SEC. 6(4), 6(5) and 7 of the FERA, 1973. I, therefore hold them guilty for the said contraventions.”

20. This apart, when we refer to the confiscation order passed by the Commissioner of Customs in its order dated 21.08.1998, it has been specifically stated as under:

“The statements of Mr. Chitrang Mehta, Manager of M/s LKP dated 06/7- 08-97 indicated that there is transaction at prices higher than those prevailing market rates. However, it is also a known fact that the rates for the foreign exchange can be fluctuating and there is hardly any transaction effected at the rates which are recorded for that day to be prevailing in the market not only for the foreign currency but also for to be other goods e.g. shares in the stock market or the metals and other commodities being traded in the specific markets. It is also to be considered that large transactions were being entered into by them and profit made on the sales of such large transactions would not ipso facto induce me to conclude that the mere fact of sales at higher prices would be a preconcerted knowledge that the dollars sold are to be smuggled out of India. I find that the price at which Ms. Pinky Jaisinghani was purchasing the dollars from other FFMCs were settled between her mentor Shri Suleman Tajuddin Patel and not considerations of any other kind.”

21. Therefore, in the impugned orders of the Original Authority, as well as the Tribunal and the Division Bench, the sale effected by the Appellants on a rate higher than the rate prevailing in the market was not the basis for the alleged violation of paragraph 3 of the FLM read with Sections 6(4), 6(5) and 7 of FERA. In the confiscation order passed by the Customs Authorities, where again the Appellants were also one of the noticees, no fault was found as against the Appellants on that ground. In the light of our above conclusions, as regards the higher value at which foreign currency alleged to have been sold by the appellant to Hotel Zam Zam, the reliance placed upon the decision in P.V. Mohammad Barmay Sons (supra) has also no application. The said decision came to be rendered entirely under different facts which cannot be applied to the facts of the present case.

22. Having reached the above conclusions, we are convinced that the impugned orders by which the Appellants were found guilty of the violation of paragraph 3 of FLM read with Sections 6(4), 6(5) and 7 of FERA and the consequential imposition of penalty of Rs.50,000/- was wholly unjustified. The impugned orders are liable to be set aside and they are accordingly set aside. If the Appellants have parted with the penalty amount imposed under the impugned orders, the Respondent is directed to refund the same to the Appellants along with simple interest at the rate of 6% per annum, within two months from the date of this judgment. The appeals are allowed with the above directions",1
SHEESH RAM AND ORS,"The appellants are original Accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 respectively in S.T. No.12 of 1993. The appellants were convicted, inter alia, under Section 302 of the IPC for the murder of one Balram and sentenced to life imprisonment. They have challenged judgment and order dated 29/5/2003 passed in Criminal Appeal No.322 of 1998 by the Rajasthan High Court, confirming their conviction and sentence.

2. One Heera son of Surajmal lodged a complaint (Ex. P-7) at Jagal Tan, Village Lapawali on 04/02/1991 at around 3.50 p.m., stating that on 04/02/1991 at 8.00 a.m., he and his son Rameshwar accompanied his other sons Balram and Bhagwan Singh who were going to Hindaun School to see them off. They were standing on the road near the turn between Lapawali and Dhara. While they were waiting for the bus, Rajdhar of village Lapawali, along with others, arrived there in a tractor. Accused-1 Sheesh Ram, Accused-2 Radhey, Accused-3 Battu, Accused-4 Rameshwar (in S.T. No.12 of 1993), Accused-Ram Kunwar, Accused-Hansey and Accused-Har Sahai (in S.T. No.350 of 1992) stopped the tractor. Accused-3 Battu exhorted “do not let this opportunity slip off”. All the persons jumped from the tractor. Complainant Heera and his son Rameshwar saved their life by fleeing towards the village. His elder son Balram fled towards the south from the road. The accused followed them. Accused-2 Radhey caught hold of Balram and assaulted him with a Kulhari. Balram fell down. Later on, Accused-3 Battu dealt an axe blow on his throat. Others too continued assaulting Balram. Balram was badly injured. He succumbed to the injuries. Accused-1 Sheesh Ram followed Bhagwan Singh, caught hold of him and inflicted injuries on him. Other accused also inflicted injuries on him. Under the impression that Bhagwan Singh had died, all the accused left the place. Bhagwan Singh was admitted in the hospital at Karauli. On the basis of this report, a case under Sections 147, 148, 324, 326, 302, 307 read with Section 149 and Section 341 of the IPC was registered. Accused Ram Kunwar was arrested on 23/6/1991. On completion of investigation, charge-sheet was laid against Ram Kunwar. Another charge-sheet was laid against accused Hanse, Har Sahai and Rajdhar. The case was committed to the Sessions Court and numbered as S.T. No.356 of 1992. Against the appellants, charge-sheet was laid on 3/2/1993. After committal of the said case to the Sessions Court, it was numbered as S.T. No. 12 of 1993. Both the cases were tried together as they arose out of the same FIR.

3. In support of its case, the prosecution examined 20 witnesses out of which, four are eye-witnesses. The eye-witnesses are PW-2 Khushiram, PW-3 Rameshwar, PW-4 Yadram and PW-5 Bhagwan Singh, who is an injured witness. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and examined seven witnesses in their defence. The trial court convicted all the accused under Sections 148, 302 read with Section 149 and Section 307 read with Section 149 of the IPC. On appeal, the High Court acquitted Hansey, Har Sahai, Rajdhar and Ram Kunwar. The High Court acquitted Accused Battu of the charges under Sections 148 and 307 of the IPC. His conviction and sentence under Section 302 of the IPC was confirmed. He has not appealed against the order convicting and sentencing him. Appellant–Sheesh Ram was acquitted of the charges under Sections 148, 302 and 307 of the IPC. Instead, he was convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC. He was sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, to further suffer six months rigorous imprisonment and to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and fine of Rs.2,000/-, in default, to further suffer simple imprisonment for three months, respectively. Appellant–Rameshwar was acquitted of the charges under Sections 148, 307 and 302 read with Section 149 of the IPC. Instead, he was convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC. He was sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, to suffer further six months rigorous imprisonment and to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs.2,000/-, in default, to further suffer simple imprisonment for three moths, respectively. Appellant-Radhey was acquitted of charges under Sections 148, 302 and 307 read with Section 149 of the IPC. Instead, he was convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34 and Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC. He was sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.1,000/-, in default, to suffer six months rigorous imprisonment and to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs.2,000/-, in default, to further suffer simple imprisonment for three months, respectively. This judgment is challenged in the instant appeal.

4. Mr. P.C. Agarwala, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that out of the eight accused, the High Court acquitted four accused. The High Court has, in fact, observed that the four acquitted accused have been falsely implicated. Counsel submitted that it is, therefore, risky to rely on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to convict the appellants. These witnesses exaggerated the prosecution story and involved the acquitted accused. It is possible that even so far as the appellants are concerned, they have not come out with the truth. This is a case where truth and falsehood are inextricably mixed and truth cannot be separated from falsehood. The doctrine of ‘falsus in uno falsus in omnibus’, is clearly attracted to this case. Counsel pointed out that the eye-witnesses appear to be tutored. They are related to each other and, hence, are interested witnesses. Their evidence will have to be read cautiously. Moreover, complainant Heera has not been examined. Admittedly, there is enmity between the two sides. There is a land dispute between complainant Heera and accused Rajdhar. Ram Kunwar’s son Kamal was murdered and, in that connection, complainant Heera and others, are facing trial. During the pendency of this trial, complainant Heera’s son Balram was murdered. False involvement on account of long standing enmity cannot be ruled out. The conviction of the appellants, therefore, deserves to be set aside.

5. Mr. S.S. Shamshery, learned Addl. Advocate General appearing for the State, on the other hand, submitted that the evidence of four eye-witnesses is consistent. PW-2 Khushiram and PW-4 Yadram are independent witnesses. There is no reason to cast any doubt on their testimony. Counsel submitted that in a catena of judgments, this Court has held that the doctrine ‘falsus in uno falsus in omnibus’ is not applicable in India. Even if some portion of the evidence of a witness is found to be deficient, the remaining portion can be relied upon, if it is sufficient to establish prosecution case. In this connection, he relied on Rizan & Anr. v. State of Chhattisgarh[1]. Counsel submitted that there is enough credible evidence on record which bears out the prosecution case. The appeal, be therefore, dismissed.

6. Deceased Balram was most brutally murdered. According to PW-12 Dr. Meena, the cause of death was haemorrhage and shock due to head injury leading to injury to brain and injury to carotid artery in neck. PW-5 Bhagwan Singh was also brutally attacked. He received four incised wounds. He suffered a fracture of left parietal bone. Being an injured witness, he is the most important witness in this case. He has described the incident in question. The defence has not made any dent in his evidence by cross-examining him. In fact, in the cross-examination, he has given more details about the incident in question, which are consistent with what he has stated in the examination–in-chief. He has stated that he, deceased Balram, his father Heera and his other brother Rameshwar were standing near the road near the boundaries of village Dehra and Lapawali. At that time, a tractor driven by Rajdhar came from village Lapawali side. Rajdhar halted the tractor near them. The appellants, who were sitting in the tractor, got down. Accused Battu was armed with an axe. Appellant Radhey was also armed with an axe. Appellant Sheesh Ram was armed with a sword. Appellant Rameshwar was armed with a dhariya and others were having lathis. They encircled PW-5 Bhagwan Singh, his father and brothers. His father and brother Rameshwar ran towards the village. Balram also ran towards the village. He ran towards Katara village. Accused Radhey caught hold of the collar of Balram and dealt an axe blow on Balram’s head. Balram fell down. Appellant Sheesh Ram dealt an axe blow on Balram when he had fallen down. Accused Rameshwar dealt a blow with a dhariya on the right hand of Balram. According to PW-5 Bhagwan Singh, thereafter, appellant Sheesh Ram caught hold of him (Bhagwan Singh). Appellant Rameshwar hit on his left temple with a dhariya. He fell down. Appellant Sheesh Ram dealt an axe blow behind his ear when he had fallen down. Accused Hanse dealt a lathi blow on his face. Thereafter, he became unconscious.

7. PW-2 Khushiram, PW-3 Rameshwar and PW-4 Yadram have corroborated this witness. It is submitted that all these witnesses are related and therefore their evidence cannot be drelied upon. Assuming they are related to each other and, hence, interested witnesses, it is well settled that the evidence of interested witnesses is not always suspect. It has to be scrutinized with caution and can be accepted if it is found reliable. Presence of PW-5 Bhagwan Singh at the scene of offence can hardly be disputed since he is an injured witness. His evidence has strengthened the prosecution case. Evidence of PWs-3, 4 and 5 also inspires confidence. So far as the acquitted accused are concerned, the evidence of these witnesses qua them is found to be exaggerated. But, on account of that, their entire evidence cannot be discarded. All these witnesses stated that the acquitted accused had lathis and they dealt lathi blows on PW-5 Bhagwan Singh. This part of their evidence is disbelieved. It is true that these witnesses have improved the prosecution story to some extent. But, that improvement or that exaggerated version can be safely separated from the main case of the prosecution. So far as the main prosecution case is concerned, all the witnesses are consistent. This is not a case where truth and falsehood are inextricably mixed up. Witnesses tend to exaggerate the prosecution story. If the exaggeration does not change the prosecution story or convert it into an altogether new story, allowance can be made for it. If evidence of a witness is to be disbelieved merely because he has made some improvement in his evidence, there would hardly be any witness on whom reliance can be placed by the courts. It is trite that the maxim ‘falsus in uno falsus in omnibus’ has no application in India. It is merely a rule of caution. It does not have the status of rule of law. In Balaka Singh v. State of Punjab[2], this Court has said that where it is not feasible to separate truth from falsehood, because the grain and the chaff are inextricably mixed up, and in the process of separation, an absolutely new case has to be reconstructed by divorcing essential details presented by the prosecution completely from the context and background against which they are made, the Court cannot make an attempt to separate truth from falsehood. But, as we have already noted, this is not a case where the grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up. The evidence of eye-witnesses is not discrepant on the material aspect of the prosecution case. Reliance can, therefore, be placed on them. In this connection, reliance placed by the counsel for the State on Rizan is apt. The same principle is reiterated by this Court in Rizan. We may quote the relevant paragraph from Rizan.

“Even if a major portion of evidence is found to be deficient, in case residue is sufficient to prove guilt of an accused, notwithstanding acquittal of a number of other co-accused persons his conviction can be maintained. It is the duty of the court to separate the grain from the chaff. Where the chaff can be separated from the grain, it would be open to the court to convict an accused notwithstanding the fact that evidence has been found to be deficient to prove guilt of other accused persons. Falsity of a particular material witness or material particular would not ruin it from the beginning to end. The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus has no application in India and the witnesses cannot be branded as liars. The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus has not received general acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy the status of a rule of law. It is merely a rule of caution. All that it amounts to, is that in such cases testimony may be disregarded, and not that it must be disregarded. The doctrine merely involves the question of weight of evidence which a court may apply in a given set of circumstances, but it is not what may be called “a mandatory rule of evidence”. (See Nisar Ali v. State of U.P AIR 1957 SC 366.)”

8. The appellants examined defence witnesses. Testimony of defence witnesses is not believed by the trial court as well as the High Court. We find no reason to take a contrary view. It is pertinent to note that Kamal, the brother of the appellants was murdered and for that murder, complainant Heera and some of the witnesses are facing trial. There is, therefore, strong motive to kill Balram, son of Heera. It is not possible, however, to come to a conclusion that because of this enmity, the appellants have been falsely implicated. We have already discussed the evidence on record. The evidence of eye-witnesses, particularly the evidence of PW-5 Bhagwan Singh, the injured eye-witness, is trustworthy. Therefore, the argument that on account of previous enmity, the appellants have been involved in this case is rejected. Taking an overall view of the matter and examined in light of Balaka Singh and Rizan, we are of the opinion that no interference is necessary with the impugned judgment. The appeal is dismissed",0
National Insurance Co. Ltd.," The short question that falls for determination in these appeals is whether the respondents who opted for voluntary retirement from the service of the appellant-companies are entitled to claim pension under the General Insurance (Employees) Pension Scheme 1995. The High Court having answered the question in the affirmative, the appellant-Insurance Companies have appealed to assail that view.

3. The controversy arises in the following backdrop:

4. In exercise of its powers under Section 17A of the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972, the Central Government made what is described as General Insurance Employee’s Special Voluntary Retirement Scheme, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as “SVRS of 2004”). Para 3 of the scheme stipulating the eligibility conditions for employees who could opt for voluntary retirement from the services of the insurance company is as under:

“Eligibility
1) All permanent full time employees will be eligible to seek special voluntary retirement under this Scheme provided they have attained the age of 40 years and completed 10 years of qualifying services as on the date of notification.
2) An employee who is under suspension or against whom disciplinary proceedings are pending or contemplated shall not be eligible to opt for the scheme;
Provided that the case of an employee who is under suspension or against whom disciplinary proceeding is pending or contemplated made be considered by the Board of the Company concerned having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case and the decision taken by the Board shall be final.”
5. In para 5 of the scheme those seeking voluntary retirement were held entitled to ex-gratia amount to be determined according to the said provision. In Para 6 of the scheme were stipulated other benefits to which the employees opting for voluntary retirement under the scheme would be entitled. It reads as under:

“6. Other benefits.-
1) An employee opting for the scheme shall also be eligible for the following benefits in addition to the ex-gratia amount mentioned in para 5 namely:-
a) Provident Fund,
b) Gratuity as per Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (39 of 1972) or gratuity payable under the Rationalisation Scheme, as the case may be;
c) Pension (including commuted value of pension) as per General Insurance (Employee’s) Pension Scheme 1995, if eligible. However, the additional notional benefit of the five years of added service as stipulated in para 30 of the said pension Scheme shall not be admissible for the purpose of determining the quantum of pension and commutation of pension.
d) Leave encashment.
2) An employee who is opting for the scheme shall not be entitled to avail Leave Travel Subsidy and also encashment of leave while in service during the period of sixty days from the date of notification of this scheme.” (emphasis supplied)
6. The respondents who opted for voluntary retirement in terms of the SVRS of 2004 afore-mentioned appear to have claimed pension as one of the benefits admissible to them under para 6 above. The claim was rejected by the appellants forcing the respondents to agitate the matter before the High Court in separate writ petitions filed by them. The High Court has by a common order dated 25th January, 2008, allowed the said petitions holding the respondents to be entitled to claim pension. The High Court has taken the view that para 6 of the SVRS of 2004 read with para 14 of the General Insurance (Employees) Pension Scheme 1995 entitled the employees to claim pension so long as they had rendered a minimum of ten years of service in the Corporation/Company from whose service they were seeking retirement. Para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995 reads as under:

“Qualifying Service: Subject to the other condition contained in this scheme, an employee who has rendered a minimum ten years of service in the Corporation or a Company, on the date of retirement shall qualify for pension.”
7. A conjoint reading of para 6 of SVRS of 2004 and para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995, would leave no manner of doubt that any employee retiring from the service of the company/corporation would qualify for payment of pension if he/she has rendered a minimum of ten years of service on the date of retirement. The expression ‘retirement’ has been defined in para 2 (t) of the Pension Scheme 1995 as under:

“2 Definition:- In this Scheme, unless the context otherwise requires:-
           xxx              xxx                    xxx

           (t)   ""retirement"" means –


(i) the retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph 12 of General Insurance (Rationalisation and Revision of Pay Scales and Other Conditions of Service of Supervisory, Clerical and Subordinate Staff) Scheme,1974 notified under the notification of Government of India, in the Ministry of Finance(Department of Revenue and Insurance) number S.O.326(E) dated the 27th May, 1974;
(ii) the retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph 4 of the General Insurance (Termination, Superannuation and Retirement of Officers and Development Staff) Scheme, 1976notified under notification of Government of India, in the Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs) number S.O.627(E) dated 21st September,1976;
(iii) voluntary retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph 30 of this scheme;
8. It was contended on behalf of the appellant-companies that in terms of para 6 of SVRS of 2004 (supra) pension will be admissible to those seeking voluntary retirement only if they were eligible for the same under the Pension Scheme 1995. Para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995 in turn made only such employees eligible for pension who had completed twenty years of qualifying service. Inasmuch as the respondents had not admittedly completed twenty years of qualifying service on the date of their voluntary retirement, they were not eligible for pension under the Pension Scheme 1995.

9. On behalf of the respondents, it was argued that the respondents had not sought voluntary retirement in terms of para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995 which is a general provision and which stipulates twenty years of qualifying service for being eligible to claim pension nor was it a case where the SVRS of 2004 either specifically or by necessary implication adopted para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995 for determining the eligibility of those seeking retirement under the said scheme. The respondents had, it was contended, voluntarily retired pursuant to the SVRS of 2004 which was different from what was envisaged under para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995. The condition of eligibility for pension stipulated under para 30 viz. twenty years of qualifying service had, therefore, no application to the respondents implying thereby that the claim for pension ought to be seen in the light of Para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995 treating retirement under the Special Scheme of 2004 also as a retirement for the purposes of that para.

10. We find considerable force in the contention urged on behalf of the respondents. The Pension Scheme 1995 provides for “superannuation pension” and “pension on voluntary retirement”. Superannuation pension is regulated by para 29 of the Pension Scheme 1995 while voluntary retirement pension is governed by para 30 which read as under:

“29. Superannuation Pension: Subject to the other condition contained in this scheme, an employee who has rendered a minimum ten years of service in the Corporation or a Company, on the date of retirement shall qualify for pension.
30. Pension on voluntary retirement: (1) At any time after an employee has completed twenty years of qualifying service, he may, by giving notice of not less than ninety days, writing to the appointing authority, retire from service.
xxx xxx xxx (5) The qualifying service of an employee retiring voluntarily under this paragraph shall be increased by a period not exceeding five years, subject to the condition that the total qualifying service rendered by the employee shall not in any case exceed thirty years and it does not take him beyond the date of retirement.” (6) The pension of an employee retiring under this paragraph shall be based on the average emoluments as defined under clause
(d) of paragraph 2 of this scheme and the increase, not exceeding five years in his qualifying service, shall not entitle him to any notional fixation of pay for the purpose of calculating his pension”
11. The SVRS of 2004 does not obviously rest the claim for payment of pension on any one of the above two provisions. That is because what is claimed by the employees- respondents before us is not superannuation pension nor is it pension on voluntary retirement within the meaning of para 30 (supra). As a matter of fact, para 6 (1)(c) of the SVRS of 2004 specifically provides that the notional benefit of additional five years to be added to the service of the retiring employee as stipulated in para 30 of the pension scheme shall not be admissible for purposes of determining the quantum of pension and commutation of pension. It follows that the SVRS of 2004 did not for the purposes of grant of pension adopt the scheme underlying para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995. Such being the case, the question is whether the provisions of para 6 of the SVRS of 2004 read with para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995 which stipulates only ten years qualifying service for an employee who retires from service to entitle him to claim pension would entitle those retiring pursuant to the SVRS of 2004 also to claim pension. Our answer is in the affirmative. If paras 29 and 30 do not govern the entitlement for those seeking the benefit of SVRS of 2004, the only other provision which can possibly be invoked for such pension is para 14 (supra) that prescribes a qualifying service of ten years only as a condition of eligibility. The only impediment in adopting that interpretation lies in the use of the word ‘retirement’ in Para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995. A restricted meaning to that expression may mean that Para 14 provides only for retirements in terms of Para (2)(t) (i) to

(iii) which includes voluntary retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in Para 30 of the Pension Scheme. There is, however, no reason why the expression ‘retirement’ should receive such a restricted meaning especially when the context in which that expression is being examined by us would justify a more liberal interpretation; not only because the provision for payment of pension is a beneficial provision which ought to be interpreted more liberally to favour grant rather than refusal of the benefit but also because the Voluntary Retirement Scheme itself was intended to reduce surplus manpower by encouraging, if not alluring employees to opt for retirement by offering them benefits like ex-gratia payment and pension not otherwise admissible to the employees in the ordinary course. We are, therefore, inclined to hold that the expression “Retirement” appearing in Para 14 of the Pension scheme 1995 should not only apply to cases which fall under Para 30 of the said scheme but also to a case falling under a Special Voluntary Retirement Scheme of 2004. So interpreted, those opting for voluntary retirement under the said SVRS of 2004 would also qualify for payment of pension as they had put in the qualifying service of ten years stipulated under Para 14 of the Pension Scheme 1995.

12. We are mindful of the fact that the word ‘means’ used in statutory definitions generally implies that the definition is exhaustive. But that general rule of interpretation is not without an exception. An equally well-settled principle of interpretation is that the use of the word ‘means’ in a statutory definition notwithstanding the context in which the expression is defined cannot be ignored in any forensic exercise meant to discover the real purport of an expression. Lord Denning’s observations in Hotel and Catering Industry Training Board v. Automobile Proprietary Ltd. (1968) 1 W.L.R. 1526 are, in this regard, apposite when he said:

“It is true that 'the industry' is defined; but a definition is not to be read in isolation. It must be read in the context of the phrase which it defines, realising that the function of a definition is to give precision and certainty to a word or phrase which would otherwise be vague and uncertain-but not to contradict it or supplant it altogether”
13. In The Vanguard Fire & General Insurance Co. Ltd. Madras v. Fraser & Ross & Anr. AIR 1960 SC 971 one of the questions that fell for determination before this Court was whether the definition of the word “insurer” included a person intending to carry on a business or a person who has ceased to carry on a business. It was contended that the definition started with the words “insurer means” and, therefore, is exhaustive. This Court repelling that contention held that statutory definitions or abbreviations must be read subject to the qualification variously expressed in the definition clauses which created them and it may be that even where the definition is exhaustive inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible for the word to have a somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the subject or the context. That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin with the qualifying words “unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context”. This Court observed:

“The main basis of this contention is the definition of the word ""insurer"" in the s.2(9) of the Act. It is pointed out that that definition begins with the words ""insurer means"" and is therefore exhaustive. It may be accepted that generally the word ""insurer"" has been defined for the purposes of the Act to mean a person or body corporate, etc., which is actually carrying on the business of insurance, i.e., the business of effecting contracts of insurance of whatever kind they might be. But s.2 begins with the words ""in this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context"" and then come the various definition clauses of which (9) is one. It is well settled that all statutory definitions or abbreviations must be read subject to the qualification variously expressed in the definition clauses which created them and it may be that even where the definition is exhaustive inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible for the word to have a somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the subject or the context. That is why all definitions in statues generally being with the qualifying words similar to the words used in the present case, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. therefore in finding out the meaning to the word ""insurer"" in various sections of the Act, the meaning to be ordinarily given to it is that given in the definition clause. But this is not inflexible and there may be sections in the Act where the meaning may have to be departed from on account of the subject or context in which the word has been used and that will be giving effect to the opening sentence in the definition section, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. In view of this qualification, the court has not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, the collocation and the object of such words relating to such matter and interpret the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Therefore, though ordinarily the word ""insurer"" as used in the Act would mean a person or body corporate actually carrying on the business of insurance it may be that in certain sections the word may have a somewhat different meaning.” (emphasis supplied)
14. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in Paul Enterprises & Ors. v. Rajib Chatterjee and Co. & Ors. (2009) 3 SCC 709 where this Court once again reiterated that the interpretation clause should be given a contextual meaning and that all statutory definitions must be read subject to the qualification variously expressed in the interpretation clause, which created them. In State of Maharashtra & Anr. v. B.E. Billimoria & Ors. (2003) 7 SCC 336 also this Court restated the principle that meaning of an expression must be determined in the context in which the same has been used. Reference may also be made to K.V. Muthu v. Angamuthu Ammal (1997) 2 SCC 53 where this Court made the following apposite observations:

“Apparently, it appears that the definition is conclusive as the word ""means"" has been used to specify the members, namely, spouse, son, daughter, grand-child or dependent parent, who would constitute the family. Section 2 of the Act in which various terms have been defined, open with the words ""in this Act, unless the context otherwise requires"" which indicates that the definitions, as for example, that of ""Family"", which are indicated to be conclusive may not be treated to be conclusive if it was otherwise required by the context. This implies that a definition, like any other word in a statute, has to be read in the light of the context and scheme of the Act as also the object for which the Act was made by the Legislature.
While interpreting a definition, it has to be borne in mind that the interpretation placed on it should not only be not repugnant to the context, it should also be such as would aid the achievement of the purpose which is sought to be served by the Act. A construction which would defeat or was likely to defeat the purpose of the Act has to be ignored and not accepted.
Where the definition or expression, as in the instant case, is preceded by the words ""unless the context otherwise requires"", the said definition set out in the Section is to be applied and given effect to but this rule, which is the normal rule may be departed from if there be something in the context to show that the definition could not be applied”.
(emphasis supplied)
15. We may also gainfully refer to the decision of this Court in Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance (1987) 1 SCC 424 where this Court declared that the best interpretation is the one in which the Court relies upon not only the test but also the context in which the provision has been made. We can do no better than to extract the following passage from that decision:

“Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statutemaker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.” (emphasis supplied)
16. In the case at hand Para 2 of the Pension Scheme 1995 (extracted earlier) defines the expressions appearing in the scheme. But what is important is that such definitions are good only if the context also supports the meaning assigned to the expressions defined by the definition clause. The context in which the question whether pension is admissible to an employee who has opted for voluntary retirement under the 2004 scheme assumes importance as Para 2 of the scheme starts with the words “In this scheme, unless the context otherwise requires”. There is nothing in the context of 1995 Scheme which would exclude its beneficial provisions from application to employees who have opted for voluntary retirement under the Special Scheme 2004 or vice versa. The term retirement must in the context of the two schemes, and the admissibility of pension to those retiring under the SVRS of 2004, include retirement not only under Para 30 of the Pension Scheme 1995 but also those retiring under the Special Scheme of 2004. That apart any provision for payment of pension is beneficial in nature which ought to receive a liberal interpretation so as to serve the object underlying not only of the Pension Scheme 1995 but also any special scheme under which employees have been given the option to seek voluntary retirement upon completion of the prescribed number of years of service and age.

17. In the result these appeals fail and are hereby dismissed but in the circumstances without any order as to costs.",0
M.B. SURESH,"Appellant, besides his father Bhadregowda, was put on trial for offence punishable under Section 302, 114 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 read with Section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. Additional Sessions Judge, Hasan, vide judgment and order dated 24th of February, 2000 passed in Sessions Case No. 24 of 1992, acquitted both the accused of all the charges. Aggrieved by the same, the State of Karnataka preferred an appeal. The High Court, vide judgment and order dated 9th of February, 2007 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 991 of 2000, reversed their acquittal and held the appellant M.B. Suresh guilty of offence punishable under Section 302 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. However, his father Bhadregowda was found guilty of offence punishable under Section 427 of the Indian Penal Code alone. Appellant M.B. Suresh was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and fine of Rs. 5,000/-, and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. He was also sentenced to undergo one year’s imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2,000/- for offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act. Both of them were sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one week for offence under Section 427 of the Indian Penal Code and fine of Rs. 5,000/- each. Sentences were directed to run concurrently. Aggrieved by the same, M.B. Suresh has preferred the present appeal whereas his father Bhadregowda, aggrieved by his conviction and sentence, has preferred Special Leave Petition No. 5363 of 2007.

Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 5363 of 2007.

According to the prosecution there was a long standing enmity between the family of the informant and the accused in respect of land of Survey No. 29/2 and 22 of Marur Village over which the accused Bhadregowda was claiming tenancy rights. According to the prosecution, on 19th of November, 1991 the deceased Chandrashekar, along with his elder brother Raghunath, cousin Krishnegowda, a friend Prakash and one Suresh came to the residence of Halegowda in the Village Marur in a tractor-trailer for unloading the gunny bags. After unloading the gunny bags, they sent the tractor-trailer along with the labourers to the coffee plantation of Ramegowda to pluck coffee seeds. However, the aforesaid persons stayed back at Halegowda’s house to have a cup of coffee and later, at about 10.30 A.M., while they were going to coffee estate by the side of the wetland of Ramegowda, Chandrashekar was ahead of them. At that time, Chandrashekar was shot at by the appellant M.B. Suresh, who was standing near the gate made of bamboo. After the first shot, his father Bhadregowda instigated him to fire again and at that the appellant M.B. Suresh fired for the second time at the deceased and thereafter they left the place. P.Ws. 1 to 3, namely Krishnegowda, Raghunath and Prakash respectively, rushed to the place where Chandrashekar had fallen on the ground and in order to save him, they carried him to the village, but unfortunately he died because of the gun shot injury on their way to the village. On the basis of the report given by Krishnegowda (PW-1), a case was registered at the Bellur Police Station. Post-mortem on the dead body was conducted by Dr. Gunashekar V.C.(PW-10), who found nine injuries on the person of the deceased caused by the appellant.

“1. Three circular pellet wounds present over the left part of the fore head, each measuring 0.5 cm. in diameter bony deep over an area of 4 cm. x 4 cm.

2. Three circular pellet wounds present near the lateral end of the right side of the lip each measuring 0.5 cm. in diameter skin deep over an area of 2 cm. x 2 cm.

3. Two pellet wounds over the left side of the front of the neck 0.5 cm. in diameter the muscle deep, there is an exit lacerated wound over the back of the left side of the neck piercing the skin 2 cm. x 2 cm., with lacerated edges.

4. Three circular pellet wounds present over the anterior aspect of the right arm each 0.5 cm. in diameter muscle deep over an area of 1 ½” x 1 ½”.

Three pellet wounds circular in shapre each measuring 0.5 cm. in diameter in the anterior aspect of the upper third of the right thigh over an area of 6” x 4” skin deep” As regards the cause of death, the doctor has stated that it was because of shock. The trial court, on appreciation of evidence, came to the conclusion that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt and, accordingly, acquitted them of both the charges. However, the judgment of acquittal has been reversed by the High Court in an appeal preferred by the State.

We have heard Mr. Basant R., learned Senior Advocate, on behalf of the appellant whereas the respondent, State of Karnataka is represented by Ms. Anitha Shenoy. Mr. Basant submits that even if the entire case of the prosecution is accepted, the same does not constitute an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He submits that according to the prosecution, the deceased died of shock but there is nothing on record to show that the shock was on account of the injury inflicted by the appellant M.B. Suresh. He further submits that the prosecution has not brought any evidence to show that the deceased suffered any grievous hurt and in that view of the matter, the appellant at most can be held guilty for an offence under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code. He points out that the appellant M.B. Suresh has already remained in jail for more than 10 years.

Ms. Shenoy, however, contends that the very fact that the deceased died within a few hours of the incident, it has to be assumed that the cause of death, i.e. shock had occurred on account of the gun shot injury caused by the appellant M.B. Suresh.

We have bestowed our consideration to the rival submissions and we partly find substance in the submission of Mr. Basant R. Dr. Gunashekar V.C.(PW-10) had conducted the post-mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased Chandrashekar and, as stated earlier, had found nine injuries on his person out of which six were skin deep of the size of 0.5 or less than 0.5 cm., three circular wounds each measuring 0.5 cm. bone deep found over an area of 4 cm. x 4 cm. over the left side of the forehead as also a lacerated wound of the same size over the left side of the front of the neck and another muscle deep wound of the same size on the right arm. The doctor conducting the post-mortem examination was categorical in his evidence that no internal injuries were found and the gun was fired from a distant range. As regards the cause of death, the doctor has opined that it was because of shock but he has nowhere stated that it was due to the injuries caused by the appellant. For holding an accused guilty of murder, the prosecution has first to prove that it is a culpable homicide. Culpable homicide is defined under Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code and an accused will come under the mischief of this section only when the act done by him has caused death. True it is that the deceased died of shock but there is no evidence to show that the shock had occurred on account of the injuries caused by the appellant. We cannot ignore that the case of the prosecution itself is that after the deceased sustained injuries while he was being taken to the hospital for treatment, he died on the way. Any mishandling of the deceased by the person carrying him to the hospital so as to cause shock cannot be ruled out. The doctor had not stated that the deceased profusely bled which could have caused shock. In the absence of any such evidence, we are in doubt as to whether the deceased suffered shock on account of the injuries sustained by him. It is not shown that the injuries found on the person of the deceased were of such nature, which in the ordinary course of nature could cause shock. We cannot assume that those injuries can cause shock in the absence of any evidence in this regard. The doctor has not even remotely suggested that the shock was caused due to the injuries sustained by the deceased. In the face of what we have observed above, we are not in a position of hold that it is the act of the appellant, which caused death. Hence, we are of the opinion that the conviction of the appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be sustained.

Next question which falls for our consideration is as to the offence for which the appellant M.B. Suresh would be liable. What has been proved against this appellant is that he shot at the deceased, but there is no evidence to show that it was the injury inflicted by the appellant which was the cause of death. However, from the facts proved, there is no doubt that he shot at the deceased with an intention to kill him or at least he had the knowledge that the act would cause the death. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the allegations proved constitute an offence under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. The view which we have taken finds support from the judgment of this Court in the case of Bhupendra Singh v. State of U.P., (1991) 2 SCC 750, in which it has been observed as follows:

“9.………The evidence only established that the first appellant shot at the deceased but it is not known where the bullet hit and whether that injury caused by the said bullet shot caused the death. Even in the case of shooting by a rifle unless the evidence shows the particular injury caused by the same and that injury is sufficient to cause death, the offence under Section 302 IPC could not be said to have been made out. In the circumstances, therefore, we are unable to agree with the High Court that the first appellant is guilty of offence under Section 302 IPC of causing the death of Gajendra Singh. However, we are of the view that while the first appellant shot at the deceased there could be no doubt that either he had the intention to kill him or at least he had the knowledge that the act could cause the death.
10. All the witnesses also say that the shot by A 1 brought down the deceased to the ground. There could, therefore, be no doubt that the shot had caused some hurt or injury though we could not predicate what was the nature of the injury and whether that injury could have caused the death. In the circumstances we consider that the offence would come under the second limb or second part of Section 307, IPC. Though imprisonment for life also could be awarded as sentence for such an offence on the facts and circumstances we impose a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment. Accordingly we alter the conviction under Section 302, IPC as one under Section 307 IPC and sentence him to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment.” Accordingly, we alter the conviction of the appellant M.B. Suresh from Section 302 to Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and sentence him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years.

Mr. Basant R. has not assailed the conviction of the appellant M.B. Suresh other than Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. As regards the conviction of the other accused Bhadregowda under Section 427, it is on correct appreciation of evidence, which does not call for interference in the present appeal.

In the result, Criminal Appeal No. 985 of 2007 is partly allowed, the conviction of the appellant M.B. Suresh under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is set aside and is altered to Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and he is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years. However, his conviction under other penal provisions is maintained. Sentences awarded to him shall run concurrently. As the appellant has already remained in custody for more than 10 years, we direct that he be set at liberty forthwith unless required in any other case.

The appeal (arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 5363 of 2007) preferred by the appellant Bhadregowda is, however, dismissed.",0
REVUTAPPA,"This appeal is forwarded to this Court by the Jail Authorities. It is directed against the judgment and order dated 8/10/2012, passed by the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Criminal Appeal No.1721 of 2001, whereby the High Court confirmed the judgment of the Sessions Court convicting the appellant for offences punishable under Sections 302, 323, 506, 201 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code and sentencing him, inter alia, to life imprisonment.

2. The prosecution story could be shortly stated. Complainant Siddakka was married to the appellant, five years prior to 25/8/2000 i.e. from the date of the incident. After the marriage, the appellant started suspecting Siddakka’s fidelity and when she gave birth to a male child, he told her that the child is not of his lineage and is an illegitimate child. Prosecution story further goes on to say that during the relevant time, Siddakka and the appellant were staying in a hut situated in the land belonging to the appellant along with their child. On 25/8/2000, when Siddakka was plucking the green gram fodder along with her son and the appellant was ploughing the other portion of the field, she saw the child going towards the appellant. The appellant stopped ploughing and took the child towards the farmhouse. After sometime, when Siddakka could not find her child, she went near the hut. She overheard the appellant telling his mother that he had thrown the child in the well of Allisab. On hearing this, she ran towards the well of Allisab, picked up the dead child from the well and returned to the hut. The appellant threatened her with dire consequences if she disclosed the incident to anyone. She was forced to tell others that the child died of snake bite. Thereafter the child was buried. Out of fear she did not disclose the incident to anyone. On 27/8/2000, when her close relatives came from Jadarbabaladi to console her, she mustered courage and told them that the appellant had thrown her child in the well which resulted in his death. They immediately took her to the Police Station and lodged a complaint. Offences under Sections 323, 302, 201, 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC were registered. The body of the deceased child was exhumed after getting appropriate permission. The dead body was sent for post-mortem examination. The post-mortem report stated the cause of death as “asphyxia as a result of drowning”.

3. On completion of investigation, the appellant was charged and tried for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 302, 201, 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC along with his mother Kallawwa who was arraigned as Accused 2. The prosecution examined 19 witnesses. It’s most important witness is PW-1 Siddakka, who lost her one-and-half year old son because of the appellant’s cruel act. Her evidence is corroborated by her brother PW- 10 Chanabasappa and uncle PW-13 Ishwarappa. The appellant did not adduce any evidence. He denied all allegations. The defence suggested that the child saw a peacock; followed it; went to the field where the well was situated, fell into it and died.

4. The trial court acquitted Accused 2, the mother of the appellant of the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC. It, however, convicted the appellant for the said offence and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Both of them were found guilty of offences punishable under Sections 323, 506, 201 read with Section 34 of the IPC and were sentenced for the said offences. On appeal, the High Court set aside the conviction and sentence of Accused 2. The appellant’s conviction and sentence was, however, confirmed in its entirety. Hence, this appeal.

5. Shri Mithilesh Singh, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence. However, the circumstances do not point unerringly to the guilt of the appellant. They may at the most raise some suspicion, but suspicion, however, strong cannot take the place of proof. Counsel submitted that the court will have to cautiously examine each circumstance for the purpose of recording a verdict of guilty or giving benefit of doubt to the accused. In support of his submissions, counsel relied on Padala Veera Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.[1] and Tarseem Kumar v. Delhi Administration[2]. Shri V.N. Raghupathy learned counsel for the State of Karnataka, on the other hand, submitted that the evidence adduced by the prosecution leaves no scope for doubt about the appellant’s involvement in the crime in question. Counsel submitted that the appeal be, therefore, dismissed.

6. There is no dispute about the fact that the child died due to drowning. Medical evidence is clear on this point. The question is whether the death was homicidal or accidental. PW-1 Siddakka has, in her evidence, described how she was ill-treated in her matrimonial house. The appellant disowned the paternity of the child. After the birth of the child, PW-1 Siddakka was not allowed to perform ‘Simant’ ceremony of her child. She went to her parent’s house. Her father performed the ceremony and named the child ‘Arun Kumar’. Thereafter, for one year, she was in her parent’s house. She went to her matrimonial house along with her uncle PW- 13 Ishwarappa. She was not allowed to stay there. She went back to her parent’s house. Thereafter, demand for money was made. PW-1 Siddakka’s parents paid the amount. PW-1 Siddakka went back to the appellant’s house because the appellant assured her that he would treat her well. The appellant took her and the child to stay with him in the farmhouse. The harassment, however, continued. On the day of the incident, when the appellant and PW-1 Siddakka were working in their field, she saw the appellant taking the child towards their hut. After 15-20 minutes, she went to the hut to see where her child was. She heard the appellant telling his mother that he had thrown the child in the well. She rushed to the well and removed the dead child from the well. The appellant threatened her and told her not to disclose the true story to anyone. He asked her to tell the people that the child died due to snake bite. Out of fear, PW-1 Siddakka did not inform anyone about the incident. The child was buried. It is only when her relatives came to console her that she told them the true story. A complaint was, then, lodged. Investigation was started. After completion of investigation, the appellant was tried as aforesaid.

7. We have gone through the evidence of PW-1 Siddakka. Her evidence inspires confidence. We have noted that after seeing her son’s clothes, she began to weep in the court and sat down for sometime without saying anything. A mother would never allow the person who killed her child escape punishment. She would also not involve a wrong person. We place implicit reliance on PW-1 Siddakka’s evidence.

8. PW-1 Siddakka’s evidence is corroborated by the evidence of her brother PW-10 Chanabasappa and her uncle PW-13 Ishwarappa, in all respects. We have noted that some of the witnesses have turned hostile. But that does not, in any way, affect the substratum of the prosecution story. The prosecution has successfully proved that there was a strong motive to kill the child because the appellant suspected the fidelity of PW-1 Siddakka. He had disowned the paternity of the child. The prosecution has also proved that the child and the appellant were last seen together. Most clinching circumstance in this case is the conduct of the appellant. PW-1 Siddakka’s parents were informed about the death of the child after the burial. She was threatened and told not to tell the true story to anyone. She was asked to tell everyone that the child died due to snake bite. This conduct of the appellant, examined in the background of the strong motive and the fact that he was last seen with the child, establish that it is he, who threw the child in the well. The medical evidence supports the prosecution case that the child died due to drowning and not due to snake bite.

9. It is surprising how defence suggested that the child went after a peacock; fell in the well and died. The well was an unused well. The scene of offence panchnama discloses that grass and thorny bushes were surrounding it. It would be impossible for a one-and-half year old child to walk such a distance, jump over the thorny bushes and fall in the well. This is, indeed, a far-fetched and astonishing suggestion. Besides, in his statement under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., the appellant has not come out with this explanation. The child was last seen with him. It was for him to explain how the child fell in the well. He has not done so. He has not discharged the burden which had shifted to him under Section 106 of the Evidence Act. Adverse inference needs to be drawn against him. In fact, this silence forms an additional link in the chain of circumstances.

10. It is true that in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the court has to be cautious. Each circumstance must be carefully examined. The chain of circumstances must be complete and it must be unerringly point to the guilt of the accused. It is also true that suspicion, however strong, cannot take the place of proof. Having examined this case in light of the settled principles laid down in Padala Veera Reddy and Tarseem Kumar, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has successfully established its case. The circumstances have been fully established. The established facts are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the appellant. There is absolutely no scope for any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the appellant. There is no merit in the appeal. The appeal is dismissed.",0
Union of India & Ors,"Being aggrieved by the Judgment delivered by the High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (C) No.7816 of 2011 dated 21st January, 2013, whereby the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Principal Bench, in O.A.No.2164 of 2011 dated 12th October, 2011 has been quashed and set aside, has been challenged before this Court.

4. The facts giving rise to the present litigation in a nut-shell are as under:

There was a vacancy in the cadre of Director (Finance) in the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and for filling the vacancy, an advertisement had been published by the Public Enterprises Selection Board on 3rd January, 2008. Somehow, nothing happened in pursuance of the said advertisement and therefore, another advertisement was published on 13th/14th November, 2008. In pursuance of the second advertisement, several applications had been received and ultimately the Public Enterprises Selection Board found two candidates suitable for appointment to the post in question. The first name was of Mrs. Anita Soni and the second name of the respondent herein.

5. After necessary scrutiny and upon getting report from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), it was found that Mrs. Anita Soni was not eligible for appointment to the post whereas the respondent, who was working as General Manager (Finance) with the MTNL, was facing an inquiry initiated by the CBI and therefore, no one was appointed from the said list.

6. As the respondent had not been appointed to the post in question, he had made a representation to the Appointment Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) so that his case might be reconsidered. The representation made by the respondent was considered and rejected by the ACC.

7. Thus, once again the post in question had been advertised on 19th March, 2010 and at that time the respondent herein did not apply for the post.

8. As the respondent was not given appointment to the post in pursuance of the advertisement dated 13th/14th November, 2008, he had filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court. Ultimately, the petition filed by the respondent had been dismissed and he was asked to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) by filing an O.A.

9. The respondent, thereafter, filed an O.A. No.261 of 2011 before the CAT praying that he should be appointed to the post of the Director (Finance) in the BSNL. The said O.A. was also dismissed by an order dated 12th October, 2011 as the CAT found that the process of taking decision with regard to appointment to the post in question was flawless. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the respondent had filed W.P. (C ) No. 7816 of 2011 before the High Court.

10. Subsequently, the inquiry initiated against the respondent by the CBI had been closed in pursuance of an order dated 22nd December, 2012 passed by the Special Judge, CBI. After the inquiry initiated by the CBI was closed, the impugned judgment was delivered on 21st January, 2013 by the High Court in the above- mentioned writ petition filed by the respondent. As at the relevant time no inquiry was pending against the respondent, by the impugned order, the appellants have been directed to appoint the respondent as Director (Finance) in the BSNL immediately after superannuation of an officer who was working as Director (Finance) in the BSNL at the relevant time. The post in question was not vacant at the relevant time and it was to become vacant on 30th November, 2013, as the person holding the said post was to be superannuated on 30th November, 2013.

11. Being aggrieved by the aforestated direction given by the High Court, this appeal has been filed by the appellants praying that the impugned order passed by the High Court of Delhi, giving direction to the appellants to appoint the respondent as Director (Finance) in the BSNL be quashed and set aside.

12. The learned counsel appearing for the BSNL had mainly submitted that the respondent had submitted his application for appointment to the post in question in pursuance of an advertisement published on 13th/14th November, 2008. He had further submitted that none was appointed in pursuance of the said advertisement as Smt. Soni was found to be ineligible and the respondent was facing an inquiry initiated by the CBI. The representation made by the respondent to the ACC had also been rejected and therefore, the matter had rested there. Thereafter, another advertisement inviting applications for appointment to the post in question had been published on 19th March, 2010 and in pursuance thereof Shri K.C.G.K. Pillai had already been appointed as Director (Finance) in the BSNL. Thus, the entire issue with regard to the appointment to the post of Director (Finance) in the BSNL had come to an end. Therefore, the respondent had no right to be appointed to the post in question. He had further submitted that the term of the abovenamed incumbent was also to expire on 30th November, 2013 and in any case, the respondent would not have any right to be appointed as he had never been appointed to the post in question.

13. The learned counsel had submitted that the High Court had made an error by not considering the fact that a fresh appointment to the post in question had already been made and therefore, the respondent had no right to be appointed to the post in question. He had also submitted that an interim relief which had been granted in favour of the respondent in the aforestated writ petition would not be of any help to the respondent that upon completion of the term of Shri Pillai, a fresh effort will have to be made for giving appointment from suitable and eligible persons so as to see that all eligible candidates get an opportunity to compete for an appointment to the post in question. He had, therefore, submitted that the impugned order be quashed and set aside.

14. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent had submitted that the respondent was wrongly denied appointment to the post in question and therefore, subsequent to the completion of the term of the existing incumbent, the respondent should be appointed to the post in question.

15. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent had submitted that the respondent was the only eligible candidate to be appointed to the post in question as Mrs. Soni was found to be ineligible and therefore, the respondent ought to have been appointed to the post. It was unfortunate that the respondent had been wrongly involved in a criminal case which was being looked into by the CBI but ultimately, the respondent was given a clean chit by the court of CBI by an order dated 22nd December, 2012 and therefore, the respondent should not have been prevented from being appointed to the post in question.

16. The learned counsel had relied upon certain judgments to substantiate his case to the effect that if an eligible candidate is not appointed due to any misunderstanding of correct legal position, such a candidate must be given appointment. The learned counsel had relied upon the judgments delivered in the case of Virender S. Hooda and others v. State of Haryana and another 1999 (3) SCC 696, Miss Neelima Shangla, Ph.D. candidate v. State of Haryana and others 1986 (4) SCC 268, A.P. Aggarwal v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and another 2000 (1) SCC 600 and Asha Kaul (Mrs.) and another v. State of Jammu and Kashmir 1993 (2) SCC 573 to substantiate his case.

17. He had finally submitted that the grievance of the respondent can be redressed by giving him appointment at present as the person holding the post in question was to retire on 30th November, 2013.

18. For the aforestated reasons, the learned counsel had submitted that the view expressed by the High Court of Delhi in the impugned judgment is correct and the appeal filed by the Union of India and others should be dismissed.

19. We had heard the learned counsel and had also perused the impugned judgment as well as the judgments referred to by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent.

20. It is unfortunate that the respondent was facing an inquiry at the time when he was selected in pursuance of the process of selection which had been initiated in pursuance of the advertisement published on 13th/14th November, 2008.

21. At the time when the respondent had applied for an appointment to the post in question, though he was found eligible, he could not be appointed as he was facing a CBI inquiry. In the circumstances, the respondent was rightly not appointed to the post in question. The respondent cannot make any grievance on the ground that he was wrongly denied appointment to the post in question because in fact he was facing a CBI inquiry at the relevant time.

22. The representation made by the respondent was also rejected and the Original Application filed before the CAT had also been rightly rejected as the respondent was not found suitable at the time when his case was being considered for appointment to the post in question.

23. It is true that the respondent was given a clean chit by an order of the CBI court on 22nd December, 2012 but by that time the entire process initiated in pursuance of the advertisement dated 13th/14th November, 2008 for appointment to the post in question had come to an end. Nothing with regard to appointment to the post in question was kept pending at the time when the next advertisement for appointment to the post in question had been published. It is unfortunate that the respondent did not apply again for the post in question. Had he applied for the post in question and had he been given a clean chit by the CBI court at the time when his case could have been considered, he might have been appointed to the post in question if he had been found to be the best amongst all candidates who had applied for the post in question. Unfortunately, this had not happened and therefore, the respondent cannot have any right to be appointed to the post in question at this juncture.

24. From the facts stated at the bar, we find that the post in question must have become vacant after 30th November, 2013 and another advertisement might have been published and if the respondent applies for the post in question, we are sure his case would be considered by the appellant authority. Looking at the plight of the respondent, as a special case we direct that if there is any particular age limit for the post in question, the case of the respondent be also considered along with other candidates even if he has crossed the upper age limit.

25. Unfortunately, the High Court did not give importance to the fact that an appointment in pursuance of the subsequent advertisement had already been made by the appellant authorities and therefore, the respondent had no legally subsisting right to be appointed to the post in question as he had not applied for the post in question again. In the circumstances we do not agree with the view expressed by the High Court that even after completion of the term of the person who was appointed to the post in question, the respondent would have a subsisting legal right to be appointed without considering other suitable candidates who might be available at the relevant time. For the aforestated reasons, in our opinion, interim relief granted in favour of the respondent would not be of any help to the respondent because at this stage, the respondent cannot be given appointment without considering other eligible candidates who might have applied for the post in question. If other eligible candidates are not given a chance to compete with the respondent for getting appointment to the post in question, injustice would be caused to the other eligible candidates and it would also not be proper to fill up any public office without giving an opportunity to other candidates who might be eligible and desirous for appointment to the post in question.

26. We had considered the judgments cited by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent but in our opinion the said judgments do not render any assistance to the respondent as facts and circumstances of the present case are quite different.

27. For the above reasons, we quash and set aside the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court. The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs",1
Janatha Dal Party,"We are, in this case, concerned with the ownership and possession of Premises No. 3, Race Course Road, Bangalore, ‘A’ scheduled property, wherein, at present, the political party Office of Janata Dal (Secular) is situated. The suit property originally belonged to one Sri C. Rangaswamy, who was the resident of Property No. 54, Hospital Road, Baleput, Bangalore City, executed a registered Gift Deed dated 22.4.1949 in favour of Bangalore City Congress Committee which was having its office at No. 142, Cottonpet, Bangalore City, which measured 5330 sq. yards. The land was donated by the donor for the purpose of construction of Congress House, wherein the All India Congress Party constructed a building, by name, ‘Congress Bhavan’, in a portion of the suit property. In the year 1969, there was split within the Indian National Congress giving rise to two groups, one led by late Smt. Indira Gandhi, under the Presidentship of late Sri Jagajivan Ram and the other group led by late Sri S. Nijalingappa. The group led by Jagajivan Ram was then called the ‘Indian National Congress (J)’, whereas the other group led by Nijalingappa was called as ‘Indian National Congress (O)’. The split in the party at the centre had its own effect in the State of Karnataka as well. The then Mysore Pradesh Congress Party broke up into Congress (J) and Congress (O) corresponding to those groups in the All Indian Congress Committee at the Centre. Each group claimed itself to be the real Indian National Congress. That dispute came up before the Election Commission of India (ECI).

2. The ECI, applying the test of majority at the organizational level and the legislative wings, by its order 11.1.1971 held that the Congress (J) was the Indian National Congress. The decision of the ECI was upheld by this Court in Shri Sadiq Ali and another v. The Election Commission of India, New Delhi and others (1972) 4 SCC 664. Consequently, Congress (J) group, formed as the Indian National Congress, came to be recognized as the Indian National Congress for all purposes.

3. The General Elections to the Lok Sabha were held in the year 1977. The opposition parties consisting of Congress (O) Group - led by Nijalingappa, Lok Dal headed by late Sri Charan Singh, Jana Sangha – led by Sri A.B. Vajapayee and Congress for Democracy - led by Sri Jagjivan Ram, fought elections together as one front under the name of Janata Party. Congress was defeated in that election. Janata Party formed the Government at the Centre, but did not last long. In the year 1978, there was a further split within the Congress. National Convention of the Congress was held at New Delhi on 1.1.1978 and 2.1.1978, in which members of the All India Congress Committee, Members of Parliament, members of the State Legislatures and Congress candidates participated and they unanimously elected Smt. Indira Gandhi as the President, though Sri K. Brahmananda Reddy was also in the fray. ECI was called upon to examine that dispute as well. Later, Sri D. Devaraj Urs succeeded Sri Brahmananda Reddy as the President of that group, which came to be known as Congress (U). However, Indira Gandhi continued to be the leader of the main body which was identified as the Congress (I). The Election Commission allotted separate symbols to the Congress (U) and (I) groups. The election to the Lok Sabha took place in December 1979 and Congress (I) was voted back to the Lok Sabha.

4. The Election Commission, in the meantime, resolved the dispute pending before it and recognized Indira Gandhi as the President of the Party, known by the name of Congress (I). It was also held that the group led by D. Devaraj Urs, known by the name of Congress (U), was not the Congress, leaving liberty to that group to approach the Commission for its recognition as a party, taking a different name for itself. D. Devaraj Urs, purporting to be the President of Congress (U), filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court against the order of the ECI dated 23.7.1981. This Court, after issuing notices to all the parties and hearing counsel on either side, dismissed the Special Leave Petition on 14.8.1981.

5. We have narrated the above facts to indicate that the suit property, all other properties and funds belonging to or referred to as belonging to the Congress are thus the properties and funds of the 1st Plaintiff herein. Similarly, all properties and funds belonging to or referred to as belonging to the erstwhile Mysore Pradesh Congress Committee or the KPCC thus belong to the 2nd Plaintiff herein. The ‘A’ Schedule property is owned by 2nd and 1st plaintiffs herein. The land comprised therein was acquired by the erstwhile Mysore Pradesh Congress Committee, as it was then called, and it constructed the buildings standing in the suit property, which was earlier known as Congress Bhavan.

6. We have already indicated that Janata Party came into possession of the schedule property in question in the year 1977. During the period, the above mentioned property was under the control of Congress (O) group. Two lease deeds were executed in respect of two portions of the vacant land, vide lease deeds dated 22.1.1971 and 10.4.1971, in favour of 3rd respondent. After the Janata Party came in possession in the year 1977, the previous Janata Party, a unit of 1st defendant, granted lease of a portion of the plaint ‘A’, schedule property in favour of 4th defendant on 04.08.1981, of which defendants 5 to 8 are partners, the portion leased is described in the plaint ‘C’ schedule. The Janata Party or the previous Janata Party had no right, title or interest for granting lease of the plaint ‘C’. Defendants 9-12 are stated to be the tenants in portions of the building constructed in ‘A’ schedule property, having taken the same on lease from the 1st defendant.

7. We have indicated that the plaintiffs instituted the present suit seeking a declaration of their title and for possession of the suit property and also sought to recover Rs.36,000/- towards past mesne profits.

Defendant 1 and 2 filed their written statements on 10.11.1983 contesting the suit, but the factual details were not disputed as such. But, it was pleaded that the decision taken by the ECI or the judgment of this Court in Sadiq Ali (supra) would not confer any title, ownership or possession of the suit property on the plaintiffs. According to the defendants, throughout, the above mentioned property was in the possession of Congress (O), and after its merger, it was in the possession of Janata Party and, at no point of time, the plaintiffs were in possession. Further, it was also pleaded that the suit itself was barred by the law of limitation. Defendants 4 to 6 filed a written statement on 31.7.1984 disputing the plaintiffs’ right to bring the suit on behalf of Indian National Congress. They pleaded that the Congress (O) continued to be in possession as the absolute owner of the suit property. Further, it is also stated that Congress (O) and some other political parties joined together and constituted Janata Party and Congress (O) was one of the constituents of Janata Party, and the property in question became the property of Janata Party and, since 1977, Janata Party has been enjoying the suit property and they were having their rights to lease out the property to other contesting defendants.

8. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed 24 issues. On behalf of the plaintiffs, 5 witnesses were examined and 17 documents were exhibited. On behalf of defendants, 2 witnesses were examined and 18 documents were exhibited. The trial Court, after examining the rival contentions, and, on facts, came to the conclusion that Congress (O), which was led by Nijalingappa, lost its identity as Indian National Congress by virtue of the decision of the Election Commission and as pointed out by this Court in Sadiq Ali case. The trial Court also held that this Court recognized the group led by Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi as the Indian National Congress. Consequently, the properties and funds of Indian National Congress, before its split in 1969, would be of Congress (J) lead by Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi and it would not be the property of the dissident group which was identified as Congress (O). On facts, it was noticed that Congress (O) was subsequently merged with Janata Party and, on account of said merger, Janata Party would not acquire ownership of the suit schedule property. It was held that since Janata Party was not the owner of the suit property, it had no right to grant lease in favour of 4th defendant and grant of such lease by Janata Party would not bind the plaintiffs. Similarly, it was also held that the grant of lease in ‘C’ schedule property in favour of 3rd defendant by the President of Mysore Pradesh Congress Committee, a unit of Congress (O) party, was illegal and was not preceded by approval or permission of Indian National Congress. The trial Court also rejected the plea of adverse possession and limitation and held that the plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing their title over the properties in question and, consequently, held that the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of possession and also mesne profits. Aggrieved by the same, Janata Party filed RFA No. 2011 of 2005 which was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court. The High Court concurred with the findings recorded by the trial Court and dismissed the appeal by its judgment dated 11.10.2013, against which this SLP has been preferred.

9. Shri Gopal Subramanium, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, reiterated all the factual contentions raised before the trial Court as well as the High Court based on the basis of the written statements filed by the contesting respondents and submitted that neither the decision of the ECI nor the judgment of this Court in Sadiq Ali (supra), would confer any title or possession on the plaintiffs over the suit property. Learned senior counsel submitted that the plaintiff could succeed in establishing their title and possession only on the basis of independent documents and not on the basis of the decision of the ECI or the judgment of this Court in Sadiq Ali. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the High Court has erred in noticing that Article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, specifies that the limitation for possession of immovable property or any interest therein based on title is 12 years and the time from which the period begins to run is when the possession of the defendant became adverse to the plaintiff. Learned senior counsel pointed out that, in the instant case, possession of the defendant and their predecessor in title became adverse to that of the plaintiff more than 12 years prior to the filing of the suit and, therefore, the suit was liable to be dismissed solely on the ground of limitation.

10. We have heard the arguments at length and have also gone through the pleadings of the parties as well as the judgments of the Courts below. We find it difficult to accept the contention raised by the learned senior counsel that the decision of the ECI dated 11.1.1971 or the judgment of this Court in Sadiq Ali (supra) would have no bearing, so far as the facts of this case are concerned. The question as to which of the two groups, Congress (J) or Congress (O) (the then Congress Party) should be recognized as the Congress, as already indicated, came before the ECI. ECI, after applying the test of majority at the organizational level and the legislative wings, took the view that Congress (J) group of Congress came to be recognized as the Congress for all purposes. The order of ECI and this Court clearly indicate that the Congress then led by Indira Gandhi had established rights on the properties in question. The Courts below have narrated in detail how the suit property came into the hands of the plaintiffs and how the Congress (O) followed by Janata Party ceased to have any right over the suit property in question. Since, on facts, it was found that the defendants have no right over the property in question, the various lease deeds executed by them also cannot stand in the eye of law.

11. We have noticed that the property in question was gifted vide registered gift deed dated 22.4.1949 by Rangaswamy in favour of Bangalore City Congress Committee. Plaintiffs could successfully trace their title and interest over the suit property towards that gift deed executed in the year 1949, coupled with the various declarations by the ECI recognizing the petitioner as the real Congress and the Judgment of this Court affirming the same.

12. We are also not impressed by the arguments raised by the learned senior counsel on the plea of limitation. So far as Janata Party is concerned, it came into picture only in the year 1977. On facts, it is clearly found that Congress (O) had no right in the suit property. In the instant case, Janata Dal (Secular) was impleaded as defendant only on 14.10.2003 and the disputed property was known as the Congress Bhavan till the formation of Janta Dal in the year 1977. It is relevant to note that the defendants had never accepted plaintiffs as the owner of the property. On the contrary, their specific case was that the 1st defendant was the owner of the property. On facts, it was found that the 1st defendant had no title over the property in question. Further, the entire burden of proving that the possession is adverse to that of the plaintiffs, is on the defendant. On the other hand, the possession of the suit property was throughout of Congress (O) and its successor parties and not that of the petitioner herein. It was after the split in Janata Party and, subsequently before the filing of the suit, Janata Dal continued to be in possession of the suit property. The plea of limitation and adverse possession was elaborately considered by the Courts below and we find no error in the findings recorded by the Courts below on that ground as well. Further, no substantive question of law arises for our consideration. The SLP, therefore, lacks merits and is dismissed.

13. Considering the facts that the petitioner is in possession of the property for a considerable long period, we are inclined to grant time up to 31.12.2014 to vacate the premises, for which the petitioner has to prefer an undertaking before this Court within one month from today stating that the petitioner would vacate the premises within the stipulated time and that the petitioner would pay the entire arrears of rent within a period of three months and will continue to pay the rent without any default. If the petitioner commits two consecutive defaults in payment of monthly rent or fails to file the undertaking, the time granted by this Court would not be available and it will be open to the respondents to get the judgment/decree executed.",0
Anand Agro Chem India Ltd,"This appeal is directed against the interim Order dated 31.7.2013 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ Petition no.14936 of 2013 whereby the Division Bench rejected the prayer of the appellant to stay the arrest of the Directors and occupiers of the appellant company.

-

3. The facts in nutshell are as follows. Respondents 1 to 3 supplied sugarcane to the sugar mill of the appellant in the year 2007-08, for which the appellant has not paid the price in spite of several representations made by the respondents 1 to 3 herein. This led to the filing of Writ Petition in Writ-C no.14936 of 2013 by respondents 1 to 3 seeking for issuance of the Writ of Mandamus directing the appellant herein to release the sugarcane price to them. The Division Bench of the High Court after hearing both sides directed the District Magistrate, Hathras to take immediate action against the Directors and occupiers of the appellant-sugar mill against whom several orders have been passed under the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation and Supply) Act, 1913 and it further observed in the order that the District Magistrate may in exercise of his powers cause arrest of the Directors and occupiers of the sugar mill to recover the dues and in the event of such arrest, they will not be released until they have paid the entire amount due against them. The appellant-sugar mill aggrieved by the said order preferred a Special Leave Petition in SLP(C) no.16633 of 2013 and this Court by order dated 1.5.2013 dismissed the petition by observing thus :

-
“We have heard Shri Sanjay Parikh, learned counsel for the appellant and perused the record.
A reading of the order under challenge shows that the appellant has not paid Rs.16.12 crores to the farmers for the crushing year 2005-06 to 2009-10, which includes the price of sugarcane, the cane development commission and the interest. It is also borne out from the record that vide letter dated 24.11.2012, the Director of the appellant had assured the Cane Commissioner that the company will pay Rs.160 lacs as the price of the cane within two weeks and an amount of Rs.700 lacs in installments, the first of which will be paid on 15.01.2013, but the company did not fulfill its assurance.
In the above backdrop, it is not possible to find any fault with the direction given by the Division Bench of the High Court and there is absolutely no justification for this Court’s interference with the impugned order.
The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.……..” Thereafter the appellant-sugar mill filed an application in the pending Writ Petition in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad seeking for stay of arrest of the Directors pursuant to the order dated 26.4.2013 and the Division Bench of the High Court after -

hearing both sides and after referring to the earlier orders held that no modification/vacation of the order dated 26.4.2013 is required and, accordingly, rejected the prayer of stay of arrest. Challenging the said order the appellant-sugar mill has preferred the present appeal.

4. We have heard Mr. Ram Jethmalani and Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, Senior Advocates appearing on behalf of the appellant, Ms. Shobha Dixit, Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents and Mr. Prabodh Kumar, Advocate appearing on behalf of the intervenor.

5. The contention of Mr. Ram Jethmalani, Senior Advocate is that the property of the sugar mill has already been attached to recover the dues and the sale notice has been issued and unless there is proof of the minimal fairness of willful failure to pay in spite of sufficient means, the arrest cannot be ordered and it would be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Jolly George Varghese and Another vs. The Bank of Cochin (1980) 2 SCC

360. He further contended that in any event the Director, whom he -

representing, is a senior citizen above 65 years of age and hence he cannot be arrested as a defaulter in payment of arrear of land revenue as stipulated in Section 171 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006.

6. When the matter was listed before this Court on 7.10.2013, Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant said that the Directors of the mill undertake to pay Rs.4.55 crores representing fifty per cent of the total amount to the concerned authority within a period of six weeks and this Court stayed the arrest subject to fulfillment of the condition. Again the matter was listed on 19.11.2013 and Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel said that by mistake he made a statement about the total amount payable by the writ petitioner but the amount is far less than that and requested for time to file additional affidavit on behalf of the appellant. In the next two hearings the matter was adjourned on the request made by the appellant and thereafter the matter was heard.

7. Section 17 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 stipulates that the occupier of the sugar -

factory shall make speedy payment of cane price and in the event of default, sub-Section (4) stipulates that the Cane Commissioner shall forward to the Collector a certificate specifying the amount of arrears of the cane price due from the occupier and the Collector shall proceed to recover the said amount from such occupier as if it were an arrear of land revenue. Section 170 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006 prescribes the process for recovery of arrears of land revenue, wherein it is mentioned that it may be recovered by anyone or more of the processes mentioned therein which includes by arrest and detention of the defaulter and attachment and sale of his movable property.

8. The Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in its order dated 26.4.2013 has directed the District Magistrate, Hathras, namely, the Collector to take immediate action against the Directors and occupiers of the appellant-sugar mill against whom several orders have been passed under the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation and Supply) Act, 1913 and this Court has confirmed the said order. The Division Bench in the present application considered the plea of the -

appellant for the stay of arrest and after hearing both sides rejected the said plea by the impugned order and we find no error in it.

9. We say so firstly because order dated 26th April, 2013 passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court directing the District Magistrate to take immediate action against the Directors of the sugar mill has already been affirmed by this Court in appeal. The question whether or not one of the Directors who is said to be 65 years old could be arrested as a defaulter and committed to prison under Section 171 of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006, could and indeed ought to have been raised by the appellants either before the High Court or before this Court in appeal preferred against the order passed by the High Court. No such contention was, however, urged at that stage.

10. Secondly, because the company and its Directors have not made their promises good by paying even the amounts which they had offered to pay. A plain reading of order dated 1st May, 2013 passed by this Court in SLP (C) No.16633 of 2013 extracted above would show that the company and its Directors -

had assured the Commissioner that they would pay Rs.160 lacs towards price of sugarcane within two weeks besides an amount of Rs.700 lacs to be paid in installments, the first of which installment was to be paid on 15th May, 2013. No such payment was, however, made by the company and its Directors. That apart, the statement made at the bar on 7th October, 2013 by Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel, for the appellant that the Directors would pay Rs.4.55 crores is also sought to be withdrawn on the ground that the same was made under a mistake. It is evident that the company and its Directors have been despite promises made on their behalf committing breach of such assurances on one pretext or the other.

11. Thirdly, because there is nothing before us to suggest that the company and its Directors are incapable of raising funds for liquidating the outstanding liability towards dues payable to the farmers. Simply because the sugar factory has been attached, is no reason for us to assume that the company or its Directors are in any financial distress thereby disabling them from making the payments recoverable from them. The fact situation in the -

present case is, therefore, completely different from that in Jolly George Varghese case (supra) relied upon by Mr. Ram Jethmalani.

12. In the light of the above, we see no compelling reason for us to interfere with the order passed by the High Court in exercise of our extraordinary jurisdiction. We regret to say that the amounts due to the farmers towards price of the sugarcane and incidentals remains to be paid to them for several years in the past thereby accumulating huge liability against the company. That is not a happy situation nor can repeated invocation of the process of law by the appellant be a remedy for it.

13. The appeal is devoid of merit and is accordingly dismissed",1
KICHHA SUGAR COMPANY LIMITED,"Kichha Sugar Company Limited aggrieved by the order dated 24th of June, 2008 passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in WPMS No. 3717 of 2001, affirming the award dated 12th of November, 1992 directing payment of Hill Development Allowance after taking into account the amount received as “leave encashment and overtime wages”, has preferred this special leave petition.

Leave granted.

Facts lie in a narrow compass;

The Government of Uttar Pradesh, by its order dated 5th of January, 1981, had directed for payment of Hill Development Allowance to its employees working at specified hill areas at the rate of 15% of the basic wage. Kichha Sugar Company Limited, the appellant herein (hereinafter referred to as ‘the employer’), being a unit of a subsidiary of U.P. Government Corporation, adopted the same and started paying Hill Development Allowance at the rate of 15% of the basic wage. The workmen demanded calculation of 15% of the said allowance by taking into account the amount paid as overtime, leave encashment and all other allowances. When the employer did not agree to the calculation of the Hill Development Allowance as suggested by the workmen, a dispute was raised. It was referred to conciliation and on its failure, the competent Government made the following reference.

Whether the exclusion of payment of overtime, leave encashment, bonus and retaining allowance while calculating the Hill Development Allowance by the Employer is legal and justified? If not, to what relief, the workmen concerned are entitled to get?

It is common ground that while calculating Hill Development Allowance, the employer has not taken into account any other amount including amount received as bonus, leave encashment, retaining allowance or overtime wages. It is the claim of the workmen that 15% of the Hill Development Allowance is to be calculated and paid after taking into account the payments made under the aforesaid headings. The employer repudiated their claim and according to it, the workmen shall be entitled to 15% of the basic wages as Hill Development Allowance. The Industrial Tribunal gave opportunity to both the employer and the workmen to file their claim and produce material and on consideration of the same, gave award dated 12th of November, 1992 directing the employer to “give Hill Development Allowance to their permanent and regular workers on the amount received regarding leave encashment and overtime wages.” However, the Tribunal observed that “Hill Development Allowance shall not be payable on bonus and retaining allowance or on any other allowances”. The employer, aggrieved by the award preferred writ petition before the High Court, which affirmed the same without any discussion or assigning any reason in the following words:

“9. After going through the aforesaid finding recorded by the tribunal concerned, I find no infirmity or illegality in the impugned award passed by the tribunal concerned and the same is hereby confirmed.” Before we enter into the merit of the case, it is apt to understand what Hill Development Allowance is. In our opinion, Hill Development Allowances is nothing but a compensatory allowance. A compensatory allowance broadly falls into three categories; (i) allowance to meet the high cost of living in certain, specially costly cities and other local areas; (ii) allowance to compensate for the hardship of service in certain areas, e.g. areas which have a bad climate and/or difficult to access; and
(iii) allowances granted in areas, e.g. field service areas, where, because of special conditions of living or service, an employee cannot, besides other disadvantages, have his family with him. There may be cases in which more than one of these conditions for grant of compensatory allowance is fulfilled. It seems that taking into account bad climate and remote and difficult access, the decision was taken to grant the Hill Development Allowance at the rate of 15% of the basic wage.
We have heard Mr. Tanmaya Agarwal for the appellant and Mr. Jatin Zaveri for the respondent. Mr. Agarwal submits that basic wage will not include the amount received as leave encashment and overtime wages. According to him, basic wage would mean the wage which is paid to all the employees. He submits that leave encashment and overtime wages would vary from workman to workman and, therefore, those cannot be included in the basic wage. In support of the submission he placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of Muir Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen, AIR 1960 SC 985 and our attention has been drawn to the following passage from Paragraph 11 of the judgment, which reads as follows:

“11. Thus understood “basic wage” never includes the additional emoluments which some workmen may earn, on the basis of a system of bonuses related to the production. The quantum of earnings in such bonuses varies from individual to individual according to their efficiency and diligence; it will vary sometimes from season to season with the variations of working conditions in the factory or other place where the work is done; it will vary also with variations in the rate of supplies of raw material or in the assistance obtainable from machinery.
This very element of variation, excludes this part of workmen's emoluments from the connotation of “basic wages”.” Mr. Garg, however submits that any amount including the amount paid as leave encashment and overtime wages do come within the expression ‘basic wage’ and, hence, have to be accounted for the purpose of calculating 15% of the basic pay.

In view of the rival submissions, the question which falls for our determination is as to the meaning of the expression ‘basic wage’. The expression ‘basic wage’ has not been explained by the Government in the order granting Hill Development Allowance. It has been defined only under Section 2(b) of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. Therefore, we have to see what meaning is to be given to this expression in the present context. Section 2(b) of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 defines ‘basic wages’ as follows:

“2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -
(a) xxx xxx xxx
(b) “basic wages” means all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave or on holidays with wages in either case in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment and which are paid or payable in cash to him, but does not include-
i) the cash value of any food concession;
ii) any dearness allowance that is to say, all cash payments by whatever name called paid to an employee on account of a rise in the cost of living, house-rent allowance, overtime allowance, bonus commission or any other similar allowance payable to the employee in respect of his employment or of work done in such employment;
iii) any presents made by the employer;” According to http://www.merriam-webster.com (Merriam Webster Dictionary) the word ‘basic wage’ means as follows:
“1. A wage or salary based on the cost of living and used as a standard for calculating rates of pay
2. A rate of pay for a standard work period exclusive of such additional payments as bonuses and overtime.” When an expression is not defined, one can take into account the definition given to such expression in a statute as also the dictionary meaning. In our opinion, those wages which are universally, necessarily and ordinarily paid to all the employees across the board are basic wage.
Where the payment is available to those who avail the opportunity more than others, the amount paid for that cannot be included in the basic wage. As for example, the overtime allowance, though it is generally enforced across the board but not earned by all employees equally. Overtime wages or for that matter, leave encashment may be available to each workman but it may vary from one workman to other. The extra bonus depends upon the extra hour of work done by the workman whereas leave encashment shall depend upon the number of days of leave available to workman. Both are variable. In view of what we have observed above, we are of the opinion that the amount received as leave encashment and overtime wages is not fit to be included for calculating 15% of the Hill Development Allowance. The view which we have taken finds support from the judgment of this Court in Muir Mills Co.
Ltd. (supra), relied on by the appellant, in which it has been specifically held that the basic wage shall not include bonus.

It also finds support from a judgment of this Court in the case of Manipal Academy of Higher Education v. Provident Fund Commr.,(2008) 5 SCC 428 in which it has been held as follows:

“10. The basic principles as laid down in Bridge & Roofs case, AIR 1963 SC 1474, on a combined reading of Sections 2(b) and 6 are as follows:
(a) Where the wage is universally, necessarily and ordinarily paid to all across the board such emoluments are basic wages.
(b) Where the payment is available to be specially paid to those who avail of the opportunity is not basic wages. By way of example it was held that overtime allowance, though it is generally in force in all concerns is not earned by all employees of a concern. It is also earned in accordance with the terms of the contract of employment but because it may not be earned by all employees of a concern, it is excluded from basic wages.
(c) Conversely, any payment by way of a special incentive or work is not basic wages.” In view of what we have observed above, the impugned award and the judgment of the High Court are illegal and cannot be allowed to stand.

In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the award and the judgment of the High Court and hold that overtime allowance and leave encashment are not fit to be taken into account for calculating the Hill Development Allowance. No costs.",1
BALDEV SINGH,"Appeal) in an endeavour to set aside the concurrent findings of the Courts below with regard to his conviction and sentence under Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (hereinafter ‘the P.C. Act’). The Special Judge had convicted the Appellant, which came to be sustained by the High Court in terms of its impugned judgment dated 8.7.2013. Accordingly, the Courts below have concurrently found the Appellant guilty, and sentenced him to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of three years and to payment of a fine of Rs.5000/-, and in default thereof, to further undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of six months. 3 According to the Prosecution, a complaint was received from Nishan Singh, an agriculturist who along with his family owned farm land in village Golewala, which, however, was at two separate places, but was being irrigated at the same time. Since this was obviously fraught with inconvenience, the Complainant wanted to have an earlier and separate allocation of canal water for the said two parcels of land. It was in regard to this request that the Appellant had demanded Rs.2000/- from the Complainant, and the matter was eventually “settled” at Rs.1000/-. The Complainant paid the said amount to the Appellant in his house, as demanded by him, but after alerting the Vigilance Authorities. These currency notes aggregating to Rs.1000/- were applied with Phenolphthalein Powder and were handed over to the Appellant in the presence of official/shadow witness, Jaskaran Singh, who was examined as PW4. Two other official witnesses also constituted the raid party. 4 We have perused the order of the Special Judge dated 11.8.2003, as well as the impugned order of the High Court dated 8.7.2013, both of which have gone into the minute details of the case, which exercise we do not consider necessary to replicate. Suffice it to say that the evidence establishes that the Complainant had handed over to the Appellant a sum of Rs.1000/- which was subsequently recovered from beneath the files. The formality of tallying the numbers on the currency notes was complied with, including the washing of the Appellant’s hands in Sodium Carbonate solution, leading to his unassailable implication. The Courts below have disbelieved the Appellant’s version, inter alia, that the currency notes had been kept under the files by the Complainant on his own volition without any demand being made in that regard by the Appellant. The Courts below have also rightly noted that the Complainant would have had no occasion to go to the house of the Appellant unless he had been specifically called; and it was improbable for the Complainant to be called to the home and not to the office, unless there was some ulterior motive, such as claim and receipt of the subject bribe. It also appears that the Complainant’s turn to receive water would not have occurred before 1.10.2000, whereas, in fact, water was received much in advance of the previous practice on 28.6.2000. The Appellant has not succeeded in showing any contradiction or inconsistency in the statement of the Complainant, who appeared as PW3 In this conspectus, we find no error in the impugned Judgment, which in turn affirms the Order of the Special Judge.

5 We are also not persuaded by the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the decision of this Court in Banarsi Dass vs State of Haryana (2010) 4 SCC 450, is of any succour to him. The prosecution in that case failed to establish that the accused had demanded illegal gratification and contrary to what has been proved in the case in hand, the recovered money was found lying on the table, apparently on the unilateral volition of the complainant. Similarly, C.M. Girish Babu vs CBI , Cochin, High Court of Kerala, (2009) 3 SCC 779, is also of no assistance to the Appellant because the Court had concluded that the sum of Rs.1500/- was accepted by the Accused in that case believing it to be repayment of a loan taken from him by PW2, and it further held that prosecution failed to establish any demand of bribe/illegal gratification made by the Accused to the PW10, as PW10 did not support the story of the prosecution. This Court found the evidence of PW2 about the demand of bribe amount by the accused as inadmissible since the same was hearsay. A. Subair vs State of Kerala (2009) 6 SCC 587, has enunciated that the prosecution is required to prove that the accused in this genre of cases had demanded and accepted illegal gratification. In A. Subair, the complainant was not examined rendering the factum of demand unproved. Interestingly, the entire case was based solely on the evidence of PW10, whose evidence was found to be lacking in quality, and , therefore, unreliable. In contrast, both the constituents of demand and acceptance stand proved beyond reasonable doubt in the case in hand. As early as in M.K. Harshan vs State of Kerala (1996) 11 SCC 720, this Court has opined that to bring home charges of bribery, the twin concomitants of ‘demand’ and ‘acceptance’ must be substantiated. In the afore-noted case, owing to conflicting versions and suspicious feature in the story of prosecution, the version of the Accused that the money was put in the drawer in his office without his knowledge was found probable. The Appellant Accused, therefore, was given benefit of doubt and thereby acquitted. It seems to us to be irrefutable that culpability or innocence is always regulated by the evidence that has been brought on record, therefore, multiplying previous decisions of this Court will be of no advantage to the Appellant. Discussing each of them will lead to making this judgment avoidably prolix.

6 In the particular circumstances of the case, we have noted that the Appellant is 62 years of age, and has already retired. As already mentioned, he has been sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/- and in default thereof, to further undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of six months. Keeping in perspective the age of the Appellant and that he is no longer in service and, therefore, cannot indulge in corrupt practices, we are inclined to reduce the sentence to two years Rigorous Imprisonment, but increase the fine to Rs.10,000/-, and on failure to pay the said amount, to further undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for an enhanced period of nine months.

7 The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.",0
Indo Asian Ltd,"The High Court while exercising its powers conferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure quashed proceedings of Criminal Case No.1004 of 2010 arising out of Crime No.24 of 2010, holding that no offence has been made out under Section 406 IPC.

3. The Appellant is a company engaged in the manufacture of copper wire having its factory at SIDCUL, Haridwar. The accused-Respondent No.2 is running his business in the name of his sole proprietorship concern by name M/s. Dynasty India and also in the name of his company named M/s. Dynasty India Private Limited. On 25.8.2008, a contract was entered into by the accused-Respondent No.2 whereby it was to process the copper rods to be supplied by the Appellant Company into copper wire.

4. The Appellant submitted that during the period between 4.7.2008 to November, 2008, the Appellant entrusted in total copper rods weighing 39,689 kgs. for processing and out of that the accused returned only 33,440.10 kgs. of copper wire to the Appellant Company. Copper weighing 26.87 kgs. was used in processing, and as such, the copper rods weighing 6,222.04 kgs. remained with the accused-Respondent No.2 which, according to the Appellant, was misappropriated and converted to his own use and the said copper was never returned to the Appellant. Few correspondences were exchanged between the parties, including few meetings as well. According to the Appellant, even though the accused had undertaken to return the copper rods, the same was not done. Consequently, the Appellant preferred a complaint which was registered as Crime Case No.24 of 2010 registered at PS Rampur, Haridwar under Section 406 IPC.

5. The investigating officer initially filed a report on 30.4.2010. Again there was further investigation under Section 173(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code and, after due investigation, a charge-sheet was filed on 13.12.2010 against the accused under Section 306 Cr.P.C. Respondent then preferred Writ Petition No.224 of 2010 before the High Court for quashing the FIR and not to arrest him. While the Writ Petition was pending, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the case vide his order dated 23.12.2010, and issued summons. Those proceedings were challenged before the High Court and, as already stated, the High Court quashed those proceedings, against which this appeal has been preferred.

6. We have gone through the FIR as well as various invoices produced before us. On going though the allegations raised in the FIR as well as the documents, we are of the view that the High Court, at the threshold, should not have quashed the complaint and the summons issued by the Criminal Court. In the circumstances, we are inclined to allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and leave it to the Criminal Court to proceed with the case in accordance with law. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and leave it entirely for the Criminal Court to decide the case on the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties. Ordered accordingly.",1
N.S.Nagendra,"The petitioner is convicted for the offences punishable under Section 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by the trial court. For offence under Section 302 IPC, he is sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs.2,000/-. For committing offence under Section 201 IPC, the petitioner is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years and also to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Both the sentences are ordered to be run concurrently. The petitioner appealed to the High Court challenging the conviction. However, the High Court has dismissed said appeal maintaining the conviction and sentence of the petitioner vide impugned judgment dated 12th January 2010. Not satisfied and undeterred, present Special Leave Petition is filed questioning the validity of the conviction, as indicted above.

2. The charge against the petitioner was of murdering a boy named Madhusudhan (hereinafter referred to as ‘deceased’) aged about 12 years who was studying in a Boarding School at Bellur, Karnataka. His mother was one Smt.Sujatha (PW6) who is the wife of PW9. It appears that because of strained relations developed between Sujatha and her husband, her husband had deserted her about 7 years prior to the incident. The petitioner had developed intimacy with Sujatha and were in a live-in relationship.

3. As per the prosecution story, the accused found the deceased to be an impediment in his relationship with Sujatha. On the fateful day i.e. on 16.9.2003 he went to the school of the deceased and took the deceased with him from Bellur to a hotel at Srirangapatnam. He hired a room in the lodge giving his name K.Raju, resident of Rajajinagar, Bangalore and signed the hotel register in the said name. The deceased and accused stayed in room No.12 in that lodge. The allegation of the prosecution is that the petitioner administered poisonous food to the child, who after consuming the said food, died. The petitioner left the hotel at around at 10.30 p.m. On the next morning at about 7.30 a.m., the Manager of the hotel (PW1) found through window of the room that the child was lying on the floor. He lodged the complaint whereupon police came. After the door of the room was broken open, it was found that child was lying dead.

4. The cause of death, as per the post-mortem report, was respiratory failure on account of consumption of zinc phosphate/poison. The death was described as homicidal. The petitioner was arrested on 5.11.2003 after investigation. Challan was filed; the petitioner was charged of the offence under Section 302 and 201, IPC; prosecution evidence led; statement of the petitioner under Section 313,Cr.P.C. recorded; the petitioner did not produce any defence witness; and after hearing the matter verdict of guilt against the petitioner was returned by the learned Sessions Judge and he was convicted in the manner described above. This has been upheld by the High Court.

5. We may record that after the accused was arrested on 5.11.2003 he was identified by PW1 in the identification parade which was conducted by I.O. (PW13). The prosecution had produced two school children as witnesses, namely PW3 and PW4 who deposed to the effect that after the school, the deceased was taken away by the petitioner on 16.9.2003. PW1, who had identified the petitioner, stated in his deposition, that the petitioner had come to the hotel on 16.9.2003 around at 5.30 p.m. along with the deceased and took room No.12. He also signed the hotel register stating his name to be K.Raju.

6. In order to find out as to whether it is the petitioner who had taken the room in the hotel, the hotel register containing the hand-writing and a note book containing the admitted hand-writing of the petitioner were seized and sent to the hand-writing expert. As per the report of the hand- writing expert, hand-writing in the hotel register and that in the note book are of the same person which clearly connects it to the petitioner. Further, mother of the deceased (PW6) admitted her relationship with the petitioner.

7. From the aforesaid testimony, it becomes abundantly clear that there is a complete chain of events, proving the guilt of the petitioner and he could be the only person who had committed the crime.

8. As mentioned above, as per the post-mortem report child has died of poison and the death is homicidal. The deceased had attended the school on 16.9.2003. Therefrom, he was taken away by the petitioner, as per the unshaken testimony of two school children viz. PW3 and PW4. The fact that he was taken to the hotel at Rangapatnam the same evening, stands proved from the testimony of PW1, supported by the hand writing of the deceased on the hotel register, proved through hand writing expert. The deceased was, thus, last seen in the company of the petitioner. PW1 also categorically stated that the petitioner was seen leaving the hotel at 10.30 p.m and whereafter he had not returned. On next day at 7.30 a.m. in the morning, the boy was found dead in the room. All this clearly proves beyond doubt that it is the petitioner only who committed the murder of the child. Even motive stands established which is accepted by the PW6 herself, namely her relationship with the petitioner. The petitioner wanted to ease out the boy who was becoming an eyesore in their relationship. Pertinently, in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. the petitioner has not denied the seizure of note book and his signature.

9. Learned counsel for the petitioner made desperate attempt, but in vain, to find certain loopholes in the testimonies of the witnesses. After going through the statements of witnesses and cross-examination, we are in agreement with the judgments of the courts below. There is hardly any substantial question of law. This Special Leave Petition is, therefore, dismissed in limine.",0
Dilbagh Singh,"The appellant was convicted under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’) and sentenced to three years and six months rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.500/- and, in default of fine, for rigorous imprisonment for another one month by the Fast Track Court, Haldwani, Uttarakhand as per Judgment and Order dated 29.09.2001. The appeal therefrom at the instance of the appellant herein was dismissed as per the Judgment dated 06.04.2013 of the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital and, hence, the appeal.

3. The incident relates back to 04.11.1993. While the informant Trilok Singh along with his sister were doing work in their agriculture field in their village Rampura Kazi under Police Station Bazpur, the appellant armed with country-made pistol along with his brother Makkhan Singh who carried a country-made gun opened fire at them. The informant Trilok Singh suffered bullet injuries on the hand, shoulder and stomach, the sister suffered only minor abrasions which were later certified by the Doctor to have been caused not by gun shot. During the course of the trial under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC, appellant’s brother and the main accused Makkhan Singh died. On the basis of evidence tendered by the injured witnesses as PWs 1 and 2, and PW3 - another eye-witness who came to the scene for rescue, the appellant was convicted under Section 307 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced as stated above. The appellant was not successful before the High Court.

4. This Court on 06.09.2013, issued notice limited to the quantum of sentence.

5. Having special regard to the fact that the bullet injuries suffered by PW1 are not from the pistol of the appellant, having regard to the fact that PW2 has not suffered any bullet injury and that she suffered only minor abrasions caused on account of fall while running, having regard to the fact that the incident is of the year 1993, having regard to the fact that the evidence tendered before the Trial Court was after eight years, and, thus, having regard to the weak evidence on the latter part of Section 34 IPC on the participation in commission of the offence, we are of the view that the proper sentence on the appellant would be two years of rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.500/- and the default sentence of additional one month as the same would meet the ends of justice. Ordered accordingly.

6. Appeal is allowed as above",1
M.D. JACOB,"The appellant was a victim of road accident on 27th July, 1997. On account of several serious injuries including amputation of complete left hand, severe injuries in head, dislocation of bones in hip and both knees and severe injuries in foot, the Doctor assessed his disability at 100%.

3. The appellant preferred a claim petition before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal at Chennai and sought compensation of Rs.26,00,000/- (rupees twenty six lacs). The Claims Tribunal allowed a claim for Rs.14,20,000/- (rupees fourteen lacs and twenty thousand only) vide judgment dated 9.8.2000 rendered in M.C.O.P. No. 3365 of 1997. The claim allowed on different heads includes:

i) Loss of income for one year as Rs.60,000/-;
ii) Special diet and transportation-Rs.50,000/-
iii) Medical expenses –Rs.50,000/-
iv) Pain and suffering – Rs.2,00,000/-
v) Permanent disability – Rs.4,00,000/-
vi) Loss of future earning – Rs.6,60,000/-
4. The Insurance Company preferred appeal before the High Court at Madras and by the order under appeal dated 13.11.2006 passed in C.M.A. Nos. 1963 of 2000 and 12 of 2001 the High Court, while maintaining the Award under the first three heads, reduced the amount of Rs.2,00,000/- for pain and suffering to Rs.1,00,000/-, Rs.4,00,000/- for permanent disability to Rs.3,00,000/- and Rs.6,60,000/- as loss of future earning to Rs.3,96,000/-. As a result of aforesaid reduction, the appellant has been held entitled only to Rs.9,56,000/- (rupees nine lacs and fifty six thousand only) in place of Rs.14,20,000/- (rupees fourteen lacs and twenty thousands only). Assailing the order under appeal on account of reduction of compensation under the three heads noted above, learned counsel for the appellant has taken us through the materials on record including the judgment of the Tribunal and the judgment of the High Court under appeal.

5. It has been shown that the Tribunal has discussed all the available materials in detail for coming to a cogent and well reasoned finding for calculating the loss of future earning on the basis of monthly income of Rs.5,000/- whereas the High Court reduced the monthly income to Rs.3,000/- without specifying any reasons for reversing the finding of the Tribunal. The Tribunal considered oral evidence of the claimant as well as documents such as Ext. P.4 and Ext. P.5 showing that the applicant had experience of working as Electrician and was employed as such. In the light of all the relevant materials the Tribunal assessed the earning capacity of the appellant as Rs.5,000/- p.m. and accordingly allowed a sum of Rs.60,000/- as loss of earning capacity for a period of one year and by adopting the multiplier of 11 allowed Rs.6,60,000/- as loss of future earning.

6. The High Court did not interfere with the multiplier and as indicated above, without good reasons treated the monthly income of the appellant to be Rs.3,000/- in place of Rs.5,000/-. Inexplicably the High court has retained loss of income for one year to be Rs.60,000/- which is possible only if the monthly income is accepted to be Rs.5,000/-. There is no reason assigned even for reducing the compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- for pain and suffering to Rs.1,00,000/- and of Rs.4,00,000/- for permanent disability to Rs.3,00,000/-.

7. Considering that the appellant had suffered 100% disability, in our view, the learned Tribunal was quite justified in allowing Rs.14,20,000/- as total compensation on the basis of monthly income of Rs.5,000/-. The judgment of the High Court under appeal is therefore set aside and the judgment and order of the Tribunal is restored. The dues payable to the appellant on account of this order should be deposited by the respondent- Insurance Company with the Tribunal within eight weeks along with interest on such amount at the rate of 9% to be paid from the date of petition i.e. 27.08.1997. The appellant shall be entitled to withdraw the said amount without any condition.

8. The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent. No costs",1
State of Rajasthan,"The respondents were tried by the Special Judge (NDPS Cases), Chhabra, District Baran for offences under Section 8 read with Section 18 and under Section 8 read with Section 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (the NDPS Act).

2. The case of the prosecution was that on 13/10/1997 during Kota Camp at Iklera, P.N. Meena, Sub-Inspector, Office of the Narcotics Commissioner, Kota received information at 1900 hours in the evening that the respondents were to handover about 10 Kg opium on 14/10/1997 in the morning between 4.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m. at Nangdi-Tiraha, Iklera, Chhipabaraud Road to a smuggler. This information was entered by SI Meena in the diary and he forwarded it to the Investigating Officer J.S. Negi, Superintendent. J.S. Negi sent this information through Constable B.L. Meena to Assistant Narcotic Commissioner, Kota. Thereafter, raiding party was formed. The raiding party was headed by Superintendent J.S. Negi. The raiding party reached Nangdi-Tiraha by a Government vehicle. Independent witnesses Ramgopal and Gopal Singh were called by SI Qureshi. Their consent was obtained. At about 4.25 a.m., the respondents came from the village Rajpura. On seeing the raiding party, they tried to run away but they were stopped. Enquiry was made with both the respondents in the presence of the independent witnesses by SI Qureshi. The respondents gave their names. Respondent No. 1 Parmanand had one white colour gunny bag of manure in his left hand. SI Qureshi told the respondents that he had to take their search. They were told about the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. They were told that under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act, they had a right to get themselves searched in the presence of any nearest Magistrate or any gazetted officer or in the presence of Superintendent J.S. Negi of the raiding party. One written notice to that effect was given to them. On this notice, appellant Surajmal gave consent in writing in Hindi for himself and for appellant Parmanand and stated that they are ready to get themselves searched by SI Qureshi in the presence of Superintendent J.S. Negi. He also put his thumb impression. Thereafter, bag of respondent No. 1 Parmanand was searched by SI Qureshi. Inside the bag in a polythene bag some black material was found. The respondents told him that it was opium and they had brought it from the village. The weight of the opium was 9 Kg. 600 gms. Necessary procedure of drawing samples and sealing was followed. The respondents were arrested. After completion of the investigation, respondent no. 1 Parmanand was charged for offence under Section 8 read with Section 18 of the NDPS Act and respondent No.2 Surajmal was charged for offence under Section 8 read with Section 18 and for offence under Section 8 read with Section 29 of the NDPS Act. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses. The important witnesses are PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, PW-9 SI Meena and PW-10 SI Qureshi. The respondents pleaded not guilty to the charge. They contended that the police witnesses had conspired and framed them. The case is false.

3. Learned Special Judge convicted respondent No.1 Parmanand under Section 8 read with Section 18 of the NDPS Act and respondent No.2 Surajmal under Section 8 read with Section 28 of the NDPS Act. They were sentenced for 10 years rigorous imprisonment each and a fine of Rs.10 lakhs each. In default of payment of fine, they were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years.

4. Aggrieved by the said judgment and order, the respondents preferred an appeal to the Rajasthan High Court. By the impugned order, the Rajasthan High Court acquitted the respondents. Hence, this appeal by the State.

5. Mr. Imtiaz Ahmed, learned counsel for the State of Rajasthan submitted that the High Court was wrong in coming to the conclusion that there was no compliance with Section 50 of the NDPS Act. Counsel submitted that PW-10 SI Qureshi has clearly stated that the respondents were communicated their right under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act. A written notice was also given to them and only after they consented to be searched by PW-10 SI Qureshi in the presence of PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, that the search of their person and search of bag of respondent No.1 Parmanand was conducted. Counsel submitted that the High Court was also wrong in disbelieving independent pancha witnesses. Counsel urged that the impugned order is perverse and deserves to be set aside.

6. Ms. Nidhi, learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that admittedly notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act was a joint notice. The respondents were entitled to individual notice. The search is, therefore, vitiated. In this connection, counsel relied on judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Paramjit Singh and Anr. v. State of Punjab[1] and judgment of the Bombay High Court in Dharamveer Lekhram Sharma and Another v. The State of Maharashtra and Ors.[2]. Counsel submitted that search was a farce. The High Court has, therefore, rightly acquitted the respondents.

7. The question is whether Section 50 of the NDPS Act was complied with or not. Before we go to the legalities, it is necessary to see what exactly the important police witnesses have stated about compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. The gist of the evidence of the police witnesses PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, PW-9 SI Meena and PW-10 SI Qureshi is that the respondents were informed that they have a right to be searched in the presence of a gazetted officer or a nearest Magistrate or before J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, who was present there. They were given a written notice. On that notice, respondent No.2 gave his consent in Hindi in his handwriting that he and respondent No.1 Parmanand are agreeable to be searched by PW-10 SI Qureshi in the presence of PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent. He signed on the notice in Hindi and put his thumb impression. Respondent No.1 Parmanand did not sign. There is nothing to show that respondent No.1 Parmanand had given independent consent. Search was conducted. PW-10 SI Qureshi did not find anything on the person of the respondents. Later on, he searched the bag which was in the left hand of respondent No.1 - Parmanand. In the bag, he found black colour material which was tested by chemical kit. It was found to be opium.

8. In State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh[3], this Court held that Section 50 of the NDPS Act is mandatory and non-compliance thereof would vitiate trial. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Pirthi Chand[4], this Court held that breach of Section 50 does not affect the trial. There were divergent views on this aspect and, therefore, a reference was made to the Constitution Bench. Out of the three questions of law, which the Constitution Bench dealt with in State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh[5], the question which is relevant for the present case is whether it is the mandatory requirement of Section 50 of the NDPS Act that when an officer duly authorized under Section 42 of the NDPS Act is about to search a person, he must inform him of his right under sub-section (1) thereof of being taken to the nearest gazetted officer or nearest Magistrate. The conclusions drawn by the Constitution Bench, which are relevant for this case could be quoted.

“(1) That when an empowered officer or a duly authorised officer acting on prior information is about to search a person, it is imperative for him to inform the person concerned of his right under sub-section (1) of Section 50 of being taken to the nearest gazetted officer or the nearest Magistrate for making the search. However, such information may not necessarily be in writing.

(2) That failure to inform the person concerned about the existence of his right to be searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate would cause prejudice to an accused.

(3) That a search made by an empowered officer, on prior information, without informing the person of his right that if he so requires, he shall be taken before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate for search and in case he so opts, failure to conduct his search before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, may not vitiate the trial but would render the recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the conviction and sentence of an accused, where the conviction has been recorded only on the basis of the possession of the illicit article, recovered from his person, during a search conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 50 of the Act.”

9. In this case, the conviction is solely based on recovery of opium from the bag of respondent No.1 - Parmanand. No opium was found on his person. In Kalema Tumba v. State of Maharashtra[6], this Court held that if a person is carrying a bag or some other article with him and narcotic drug is recovered from it, it cannot be said that it was found from his person and, therefore, it is not necessary to make an offer for search in the presence of a gazetted officer or a Magistrate in compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Pawan Kumar[7], three- Judge Bench of this Court held that a person would mean a human being with appropriate coverings and clothing and also footwear. A bag, briefcase or any such article or container etc. can under no circumstances be treated as a body of a human being. Therefore, it is not possible to include these articles within the ambit of the word “person” occurring in Section 50 of the NDPS Act. The question is, therefore, whether Section 50 would be applicable to this case because opium was recovered only from the bag carried by respondent No.1 - Parmanand.

10. In Dilip & Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh[8], on the basis of information, search of the person of the accused was conducted. Nothing was found on their person. But on search of the scooter they were riding, opium contained in plastic bag was recovered. This Court held that provisions of Section 50 might not have been required to be complied with so far as the search of the scooter is concerned, but keeping in view the fact that the person of the accused was also searched, it was obligatory on the part of the officers to comply with the said provisions, which was not done. This Court confirmed the acquittal of the accused.

11. In Union of India v. Shah Alam[9], heroin was first recovered from the bags carried by the respondents therein. Thereafter, their personal search was taken but nothing was recovered from their person. It was urged that since personal search did not lead to any recovery, there was no need to comply with the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. Following Dilip, it was held that since the provisions of Section 50 of the NDPS Act were not complied with, the High Court was right in acquitting the respondents on that ground.

12. Thus, if merely a bag carried by a person is searched without there being any search of his person, Section 50 of the NDPS Act will have no application. But if the bag carried by him is searched and his person is also searched, Section 50 of the NDPS Act will have application. In this case, respondent No.1 Parmanand’s bag was searched. From the bag, opium was recovered. His personal search was also carried out. Personal search of respondent No.2 Surajmal was also conducted. Therefore, in light of judgments of this Court mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, Section 50 of the NDPS Act will have application.

13. It is now necessary to examine whether in this case, Section 50 of the NDPS Act is breached or not. The police witnesses have stated that the respondents were informed that they have a right to be searched before a nearest gazetted officer or a nearest Magistrate or before PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent. They were given a written notice. As stated by the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh, it is not necessary to inform the accused person, in writing, of his right under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act. His right can be orally communicated to him. But, in this case, there was no individual communication of right. A common notice was given on which only respondent No.2 – Surajmal is stated to have signed for himself and for respondent No.1 – Parmanand. Respondent No.1 Parmanand did not sign.

14. In our opinion, a joint communication of the right available under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act to the accused would frustrate the very purport of Section 50. Communication of the said right to the person who is about to be searched is not an empty formality. It has a purpose. Most of the offences under the NDPS Act carry stringent punishment and, therefore, the prescribed procedure has to be meticulously followed. These are minimum safeguards available to an accused against the possibility of false involvement. The communication of this right has to be clear, unambiguous and individual. The accused must be made aware of the existence of such a right. This right would be of little significance if the beneficiary thereof is not able to exercise it for want of knowledge about its existence. A joint communication of the right may not be clear or unequivocal. It may create confusion. It may result in diluting the right. We are, therefore, of the view that the accused must be individually informed that under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act, he has a right to be searched before a nearest gazetted officer or before a nearest Magistrate. Similar view taken by the Punjab & Haryana High Court in Paramjit Singh and the Bombay High Court in Dharamveer Lekhram Sharma meets with our approval. It bears repetition to state that on the written communication of the right available under Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act, respondent No.2 Surajmal has signed for himself and for respondent No.1 Parmanand. Respondent No.1 Parmanand has not signed on it at all. He did not give his independent consent. It is only to be presumed that he had authorized respondent No.2 Surajmal to sign on his behalf and convey his consent. Therefore, in our opinion, the right has not been properly communicated to the respondents. The search of the bag of respondent No.1 Parnanand and search of person of the respondents is, therefore, vitiated and resultantly their conviction is also vitiated.

15. We also notice that PW-10 SI Qureshi informed the respondents that they could be searched before the nearest Magistrate or before a nearest gazetted officer or before PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, who was a part of the raiding party. It is the prosecution case that the respondents informed the officers that they would like to be searched before PW-5 J.S. Negi by PW-10 SI Qureshi. This, in our opinion, is again a breach of Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act. The idea behind taking an accused to a nearest Magistrate or a nearest gazetted officer, if he so requires, is to give him a chance of being searched in the presence of an independent officer. Therefore, it was improper for PW-10 SI Qureshi to tell the respondents that a third alternative was available and that they could be searched before PW-5 J.S. Negi, the Superintendent, who was part of the raiding party. PW-5 J.S. Negi cannot be called an independent officer. We are not expressing any opinion on the question whether if the respondents had voluntarily expressed that they wanted to be searched before PW-5 J.S. Negi, the search would have been vitiated or not. But PW-10 SI Qureshi could not have given a third option to the respondents when Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act does not provide for it and when such option would frustrate the provisions of Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act. On this ground also, in our opinion, the search conducted by PW-10 SI Qureshi is vitiated. We have, therefore, no hesitation in concluding that breach of Section 50(1) of the NDPS Act has vitiated the search. The conviction of the respondents was, therefore, illegal. The respondents have rightly been acquitted by the High Court. It is not possible to hold that the High Court’s view is perverse. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

Hari Nandan Prasad & Anr,"The two appellants have filed one combined Special Leave Petition, which arises out of a common judgment dated 27.6.2008 passed by the Division Bench of the Jharkhand High Court in two LPAs which had been filed by the respondent herein viz. Food Corporation of India (FCI). The two appellants were working on casual basis with the FCI. After certain time, their services were dispensed with. Both of them raised industrial dispute alleging wrongful termination which was referred to the Central Government- cum- Industrial Tribunal (CGIT). These proceedings culminated in two awards dated 12.12.1996 and 18.12.1996 respectively passed by the CGIT. In both these awards, termination of both the appellants was held to be illegal and they were directed to be reinstated with 50% back wages. The CGIT also ordered their regularization in service. FCI filed Writ Petitions in both the cases challenging these awards which were initially admitted sometime in the year 1988 and the operation of the awards was stayed. However, orders were passed under Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act (ID Act) directing payment of full wages as last wages drawn to the appellants from the date of the award in each case. These Writ Petitions were ultimately dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide common judgment and order dated 19.5.2005. As pointed out above, this judgment of the learned Single Judge was challenged by the FCI by filing LPAs. These LPAs have been allowed by the Division Bench, thereby setting aside the orders of the learned Single Judge as well as awards passed by the CGIT. This is how two appellants are before us in this appeal.

3. Before we proceed further, we deem it appropriate to give the details of nature of employment of each of the appellants with the FCI and tenure etc. as well as the gist of the tribunal’s awards.

Hari Nandan.

4. He was engaged on daily wages basis as Labourer-cum-Workman, in the exigency of the situation, at Food Storage Depot, Jasidih by the Depot In- charge, FCI, Jasidih on 1st June 1980. On the ground that services of appellant No.1 were no more required, he was disengaged w.e.f. 1.3.1983. While doing so, no notice or notice pay or retrenchment compensation was given to him. Appellant No.1 raised industrial dispute which was referred to the CGIT by the Central Government vide reference order dated 1.10.1992, with the following terms of reference:

“Whether the action of the management of Food Corporation of India, in retrenching Shri Hari Nandan Prasad, Ex-Casual Workman, in contravention of Section 25-F of the I.D.Act, 1947 and denying reinstatement with full back wages and regularization of his service is legal and justified? If not to what relief the concerned workman is entitled to?”
5. The CGIT gave its award dated 12.12.1996 holding that the termination was in contravention of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act. The CGIT also, while ordering reinstatement of appellant No.1, held that he was also entitled to regularization of his services from the date of his stoppage from service dated 1.3.1983. Back wages to the extent of 50% were awarded. As far as direction for regularization is concerned, it was based on Circular issued by the FCI whereby any temporary worker employed for more than 90 days was entitled for regularization of his service. It was noted that as per the said Circular the Management had regularized the services of 70-75 similarly situated casual workers and therefore denying the same benefit to appellant No.1 amounted to discrimination.

6. Appellant No.2 was engaged on daily wages as casual Typist at the District Office, FCI, Darbhanga against a vacancy of Class-III post on 5.9.1986. He worked in the capacity till 15.9.1990 when his name was struck off the rolls. He also raised industrial dispute which was referred to CGIT with following terms of reference:

“Whether the action of the Management of Food Corporation of India, Laaherisarai, Darbhanga is legal and justified in retrenching Shri Govind Kumar Chaudhary, who was working as Casual Typist, arbitrarily and in violation of Section 25-F of the I.D.Act, and denying reinstatement with full back wages and regularization of service is legal and justified? If not to what relief the concerned workman is entitled to?” In his case, the award dated 18.12.1996 was made by the CGIT on almost identical premise, as in the case of appellant No.1, supported by similar reasons.
7. The learned Single Judge while dismissing both the Writ Petitions filed by the FCI concurred with the findings and reasons given by the CGIT.

8. In the LPAs before the Division Bench, the primary contention of the FCI was that there could not have been any direction of regularization of services even on the admitted case of both the workmen, viz. merely on the ground that they had worked for more than 240 days in a calendar year as casual employees. It was also submitted that though the District Manager of the FCI was authorized to employ persons as temporary workers, such an authority was given for employing them for 7 days only and no more, and in case of violation of this strict stipulation contained in the Circular issued by the FCI, the concerned officer could be proceeded against departmentally. It was further argued that even if such temporary employment was to continue beyond stipulated period of 7 days, since these two workmen had worked on daily wages basis, that too for a period of 3 years or so, there could not have been any regularization of these workmen in view of the judgments of this Court in the case of Delhi Development Horticulture Employees Union vs. Delhi Administration AIR 1992 SC 789 and Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi & Ors. (2006) 4 SCC 1. These contentions have impressed the Division Bench of the High Court, and accepted by it, giving the following reasons:

“The Tribunal has apparently misconceived the principles of law laid down in this context. In the case of Delhi Development Horticulture Employees Union vs. Delhi Administration (AIR 1992) SC 789) the Supreme Court has categorically laid down that temporary employees, even if they have worked for more than 240 days, cannot claim any right or benefit for automatic regularization of their services. Similar view has been taken in the case of Post Master General, Kolkata & Ors vs. Tutu Das (Dutta), reported in 2007 (5) SCC 317. More so, where no posts are created or no vacancies to sanctioned posts exists, only on the ground of working for more than 240 days, regularization cannot be directed. Even in cases where there are regular posts and vacancies, the procedure laid down for appointment has to be followed.”
9. In so far as contention of the appellant predicated on Circular dated 6.5.1997 is concerned, on the basis of which they claimed that 70-75 persons had been regularized and discriminatory treatment could not be meted to them, this contention has been brushed aside by the High Court in the impugned judgment in the following manner:

“The, contention of Mrs.Pal that there has been discrimination as several persons were regularized on the basis of the Circular of the Management dated 6.5.1987, cannot be accepted. Reliance for this purpose on the case of U.P. State Electricity Board vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey reported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, is also of no help to her. Firstly, there were several conditions and criteria in the said Circular for regularization, but there is no finding that the respondents workmen in these appeals fulfilled such criteria. Secondly, in the case of U.P.State Electricity Board matter (supra) the employees of the Co-operative Society who were taken over by the Electricity Board claimed that the decision of the Electricity Board dated 28.11.1996 permitting regularization of the employees working from before 4.5.1990, will also apply to them as they were also appointed prior to 4.5.1990 in the Society. It was held that since the taken over employees were appointed in the Society before 4.5.1990, they could not be denied the benefit of the said decision of the Electricity Board. There is nothing to show that the appointment of the taken over employees was made by the Society without following the procedure in that behalf, whereas in the present case, the respondents workmen were not appointed against vacant and sanctioned posts after following the procedure of appointment.
Furthermore, in paragraph 6 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi (2006) 4 SCC 1, it was held that no Government order, notification or circular can be substituted for the statutory rules framed under the authority of law. In para 16 of the judgment in the case of R.S.Garg vs. State of U.P. (2006 (6) SCC 430), it has been held that even the Government cannot make rules or issue any executive instructions by way of regularization. Similar view has been taken in the case of the Post Master General (supra). Therefore, the respondent workmen cannot claim regularization on the basis of the said Circular of the Management dated 6.5.1987, nor the said judgment of the U.P. Electricity Board (supra) is of any help to them.”
10. Heavily relying upon the judgment in the case of Uma Devi (supra), the High Court has held that as both the appellants did not render 10 or more years of service, their cases do not come even in the exception carved out by the Constitution Bench in Uma Devi’s case.

11. Another contention raised by the appellants before the High Court was that the ratio of Uma Devi’s case had no relevance in the cases of industrial adjudication by the Labour Courts/Industrial Tribunals. However, even this submission was found to be meritless by the High Court taking support of the judgment of this Court in U.P. Power Corporation Vs. Bijli Mazdoor Sangh & Ors. (2007) 5 SCC 755.

12. We may record here that the Division Bench accepted that there was infraction of Section 25-F of the I.D.Act in both the cases. However, they were held not entitled to reinstatement because of the reason that they were employed strictly as temporary workers, without any stipulation or promise that they would be made permanent and therefore reinstatement of such workers was not warranted and they were entitled to get monetary compensation only. As far as compensation is concerned, since both the appellants were paid the money equivalent to wages last drawn, for number of years when the Writ Petitions were pending, under Section 17 -B of the I.D. Act, the High Court felt that the appellants were duly compensated and no further amount was payable.

13. Challenging the validity of the approach of the High Court, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the entire thrust of the judgment of the High Court rests on the decision of this Court in Uma Devi’s case which was impermissible as the said judgment is clarified by this Court subsequently in the case of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation & Anr. vs. Casteribe Rajya Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana (2009) 8 SCC 556, wherein it is held, in categorical terms, that in so far as Industrial and Labour Courts are concerned, they enjoy wide powers under Section 30(1)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act to take affirmative action in case of unfair labour practice and these powers include power to order regularization/permanency. The Court has, further, clarified that decision in Uma Devi limits the scope of powers of Supreme Court under Article 32 and High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue directions for regularization in the matter of public employment, but power to take affirmative action under section 30(1)(b) of the I.D.Act which rests with the Industrial/Labour Courts, remains intact. It was, thus, argued that entire edifice of the impugned judgment of the High Court erected on the foundation of Uma Devi (supra) crumbles.

14. The learned counsel for the FCI, on the other hand, referred to the judgment in U.P. Power Corporation (supra) wherein this Court has taken unambiguous view that the law laid down in Uma Devi is applicable to Industrial Tribunals/Labour Courts as well. It was submitted that the judgment in U.P. Power Corporation (supra) was not taken note of in the subsequent judgment in Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (supra) and this Court should follow the earlier judgment rendered in U.P.Power Corporation’s case. The learned counsel also relied upon the recent judgment of this Court in the case of Assistant Engineer, Rajasthan Development Corporation & Anr. vs. Gitam Singh (2013) 5 SCC 136 to contend that even when there is a wrongful termination of services of a daily wager because of non-compliance of the provisions of Section 25-F of the I.D.Act, such an employee is not entitled to reinstatement but only monetary compensation. On the aforesaid basis, the learned counsel pleaded for dismissal of the appeal.

15. We have given considerable thoughts to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties on either side. It is clear from the aforesaid narratives that this case has two facets, which are reflected even in the terms of references as well on which the disputes were referred to the CGIT. First refers to the validity of the termination and the other one pertains to the regularization. Twin issues, which have, thus, to be gone into, are: (1) whether termination of service of the appellants was illegal?

Related issue here would be that if it is illegal, then whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the appellants would be entitled to reinstatement in service or monetary compensation in lieu of reinstatement would be justified?

(2) whether the appellants are entitled to regularization of their services?

We would also record that both the issues, in the facts of this case, are somewhat overlapping which would become apparent, with the progression of our discussion on these issues.

Reg.: Validity of termination.

16. This issue hardly poses any problem. Admitted facts are that both the appellant had worked for more than 240 days continuously preceding their disengagement/termination. At the time of their disengagement, even when they had continuous service for more than 240 days (in fact about 3 years) they were not given any notice or pay in lieu of notice as well as retrenchment compensation. Thus, mandatory pre-condition of retrenchment in paying the aforesaid dues in accordance with Section 25-F of the I.D. Act was not complied with. That is sufficient to render the termination as illegal. Even the High Court in the impugned judgment has accepted this position and there was no quarrel on this aspect before us as well. With this, we advert to the issue of relief which should be granted in such cases, as that was the topic of hot debate before us as well.

17. Admittedly, both the workmen were engaged on daily wages basis. Their engagement was also in exigency of situation. In so far as appellant No.1 is concerned, he was disengaged way back in the year 1983. The dispute in his case was referred for adjudication to CGIT in 1992 only. There is a time lag of 9 years. Though no reasons are appearing on record for such an abnormal delay, it seems that he had raised the industrial dispute few years after his disengagement which can be inferred from the reading of the award of the CGIT as that reveals that after his disengagement he kept on making representations only and he took recourse to judicial proceedings only after Circular dated 6.5.1997 was issued as per which the FCI had decided to regularize the services of all casual workmen who had completed more than 90 days before 1996. Be that as it may, at this juncture what we are highlighting is that appellant No.1 had worked on daily wages basis for barely 3 years and he is out of service for last 30 years. Even when the Tribunal rendered his award in 1996, 13 years had elapsed since his termination. On these facts, it would be difficult to give the relief of reinstatement to the persons who were engaged as daily wagers and whose services were terminated in a distant past. And, further where termination is held to be illegal only on a technical ground of not adhering to the provisions of Section 25-F of the Act. Law on this aspect, as developed over a period of time by series of judgments makes the aforesaid legal position very eloquent. It is not necessary to traverse through all these judgments. Our purpose would be served by referring to a recent judgment rendered by this very Bench in the case of BSNL vs. Bhurumal 2013 (15) SCALE 131 which has taken note of the earlier case law relevant to the issue. Following passage from the said judgment would reflect the earlier decisions of this Court on the question of reinstatement:

“The learned counsel for the appellant referred to two judgments wherein this Court granted compensation instead of reinstatement. In the case of BSNL vs. Man Singh (2012) 1 SCC 558, this Court has held that when the termination is set aside because of violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, it is not necessary that relief of reinstatement be also given as a matter of right. In the case of Incharge Officer & Anr. vs. Shankar Shetty (2010) 9 SCC 126, it was held that those cases where the workman had worked on daily wage basis, and worked merely for a period of 240 days or 2-3 years and where the termination had taken place many years ago, the recent trend was to grant compensation in lieu of reinstatement. In this judgment of Shankar Shetty, this trend was reiterated by referring to various judgments, as is clear from the following discussion.
Should an order of reinstatement automatically follow in a case where the engagement of a daily wager has been brought to end in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short “the ID Act”)? The course of the decisions of this Court in recent years has been uniform on the above question.
In Jagbir Singh vs. Haryana State Agriculture Mktd. Board (2009) 15 SCC 327 delivering the judgment of this Court, one of us (R.M.Lodha,J.) noticed some of the recent decisions of this Court, namely, U.P.State Brassware Corpn. Ltd. Vs. Uday Narain Pandey (2006) 1 SCC 479, Uttaranchal Forest Department Corpn. Vs. M.C.Joshi (2007) 9 SCC 353, State of M.P. vs. Lalit Kumar Verma (2007) 1 SCC 575, M.P.Admn. vs. Tribhuban (2007) 9 SCC 748, Sita Ram vs. Moti Lal Nehru Farmers Training Institute (2008) 5 SCC 75, Jaipur Development Authority vs. Ramsahai (2006) 11 SCC 684, GDA vs. Ashok Kumar (2008) 4 SCC 261 and Mahboob Deepak vs. Nagar Panchayat, Gajraula (2008) 1 SCC 575 and stated as follows: (Jagbir Singh case, SCC pp.330 & 335 paras 7 & 14).
It is true that the earlier view of this Court articulated in many decision reflected the legal position that if the termination of an employee was found to be illegal, the relief of reinstatement with full back wages would ordinarily follow. However, in recent past, there has been a shift in the legal position and in a long line of cases, this Court has consistently taken the view that relief by way of reinstatement with back wages is not automatic and may be wholly inappropriate in a given fact situation even though the termination of an employee is in contravention of the prescribed procedure. Compensation instead of reinstatement has been held to meet the ends of justice.
It would be, thus, seen that by a catena of decisions in recent time, this Court has clearly laid down that an order of retrenchment passed in violation of Section 25-F although may be set aside but an award of reinstatement should not, however, automatically passed. The award of reinstatement with full back wages in a case where the workman has completed 240 days of work in a year preceding the date of termination, particularly, daily wagers has not been found to be proper by this Court and instead compensation has been awarded. This Court has distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a post and a permanent employee.
Jagbir Singh has been applied very recently in Telegraph Deptt. Vs. Santosh Kumar Seal (2010) 6 SCC 773, wherein this Court stated: (SCC p.777, para 11) In view of the aforesaid legal position and the fact that the workmen were engaged as daily wagers about 25 years back and they worked hardly for 2 or 3 years, relief of reinstatement and back wages to them cannot be said to be justified and instead monetary compensation would subserve the ends of justice.
Taking note of the judgments referred to in the aforesaid paragraphs and also few more cases in other portion of the said judgment, the legal position was summed up in the following manner:

“It is clear from the reading of the aforesaid judgments that the ordinary principle of grant of reinstatement with full back wages, when the termination is found to be illegal is not applied mechanically in all cases. While that may be a position where services of a regular/permanent workman are terminated illegally and/or malafide and/or by way of victimization, unfair labour practice etc. However, when it comes to the case of termination of a daily wage worker and where the termination is found illegal because of procedural defect, namely in violation of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, this Court is consistent in taking the view in such cases reinstatement with back wages is not automatic and instead the workman should be given monetary compensation which will meet the ends of justice. Rationale for shifting in this direction is obvious.
Reasons for denying the relief of reinstatement in such cases are obvious. It is trite law that when the termination is found to be illegal because of non-payment of retrenchment compensation and notice pay as mandatorily required under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, even after reinstatement, it is always open to the management to terminate the services of that employee by paying him the retrenchment compensation. Since such a workman was working on daily wage basis and even after he is reinstated, he has no right to seek regularization (See: State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi (2006) 4 SCC 1). Thus when he cannot claim regularization and he has no right to continue even as a daily wage worker, no useful purpose is going to be served in reinstating such a workman and he can be given monetary compensation by the Court itself inasmuch as if he is terminated again after reinstatement, he would receive monetary compensation only in the form of retrenchment compensation and notice pay. In such a situation, giving the relief of reinstatement, that too after a long gap, would not serve any purpose.
We would, however, like to add a caveat here. There may be cases where termination of a daily wage worker is found to be illegal on the ground it was resorted to as unfair labour practice or in violation of the principle of last come first go viz. while retrenching such a worker daily wage juniors to him were retained. There may also be a situation that persons junior to him wee regularized under some policy but the concerned workman terminated. In such circumstances, the terminated worker should not be denied reinstatement unless there are some other weighty reasons for adopting the course of grant of compensation instead of reinstatement. In such cases, reinstatement should be the rule and only in exceptional cases for the reasons stated to be in writing, such a relief can be denied”.
18. We make it clear that reference to Uma Devi, in the aforesaid discussion is in a situation where the dispute referred pertained to termination alone. Going by the principles carved out above, had it been a case where the issue is limited only to the validity of termination, appellant No.1 would not be entitled to reinstatement. This could be the position in respect of appellant No.2 as well. Though the factual matrix in his case is slightly different, that by itself would not have made much of a difference. However, the matter does not end here. In the present case, the reference of dispute to the CGIT was not limited to the validity of termination. The terms of reference also contained the claim made by the appellants for their regularization of service.

19. We have already pointed out that the two aspects viz. that of reinstatement and regularization are intermixed and overlapping in the present case. If the appellants were entitled to get their services regularized, in that case it would have been axiomatic to grant the relief of reinstatement as a natural corollary. Therefore, it becomes necessary, at this stage, to examine as to whether the order of CGIT, as affirmed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court directing regularization of their service, was justified or the approach of the Division Bench of the High Court in denying that relief is correct.

Re: Relief of Regularization

20. Before we advert to this question, it would be necessary to examine as to whether the Constitution Bench judgment in Uma Devi case have applicability in the matters concerning industrial adjudication. We have already pointed out above the contention of the counsel for the appellants in this behalf, relying upon Maharashtra State Road Transport case that the decision in Uma Devi would be binding the Industrial or Labour Courts. On the other hand, counsel for the FCI has referred to the judgment in U.P.Power Corporation for the submission that law laid down in Uma Devi equally applies to Industrial Tribunals/Labour Courts. It, thus, becomes imperative to examine the aforesaid two judgments at this juncture.

21. A perusal of the judgment in U.P. Power Corporation would demonstrate that quite a few disputes were raised and referred to the industrial tribunal qua the alleged termination of respondent Nos.2 and 3 in that case. Without giving the details of those cases, it would be sufficient to mention that in one of the cases the tribunal held that after three years of their joining in service both respondents 2 and 3 were deemed to have been regularized. The appellants filed the Writ Petition which was also dismissed. Challenging the order of the High Court, the appellants had approached this Court. It was argued that there could not have been any regularization order passed by the Industrial Court in view of the decision in Uma Devi. Counsel for the workmen had taken a specific plea that the powers of the industrial adjudicator were not under consideration in Uma Devi’s case and that there was a difference between a claim raised in a civil suit or a Writ Petition on the one hand and one adjudicated by the industrial adjudicator. It was also argued that the labour court can create terms existing in the contract to maintain industrial peace and therefore it had the power to vary the terms of the contract. While accepting the submission of the appellant therein viz. U.P. Power Corporation, the Court gave the following reasons:

“It is true as contended by learned counsel for the respondent that the question as regards the effect of the industrial adjudicators’ powers was not directly in issue in Umadevi case. But the foundation logic in Umadevi case is based on Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Though the industrial adjudicator can very the terms of the contract of the employment, it cannot do something which is violative of Article 14. If the case is one which is covered by the concept of regularization, the same cannot be viewed differently.
The plea of learned counsel for the respondent that at the time the High Court decided the matter, decision in Umadevi case was not rendered is really of no consequence. There cannot be a case of regularization without there being employee-employer relationship. As noted above the concept of regularization is clearly linked with Article 14 of the Constitution. However, if in a case the fact situation is covered by what is stated in para 45 of Umadevi case the industrial adjudicator can modify the relief, but that does not dilute the observations made by this Court in Umadevi case about the regularization.
On facts, it is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that Respondent No.2 himself admitted that he never worked as a pump operator, but was engaged as daily wage basis. He also did not possess the requisite qualification. Looked at from any angle, the direction for regularization, as given, could not have been given in view of what has been stated in Umadevi case.”
22. It is clear from the above that the Court emphasized the underline message contained in Umadevi’s case to the effect that regularization of a daily wager, which has not been appointed after undergoing the proper selection procedure etc. is impermissible as it was violative of Art.14 of the Constitution of India and this principle predicated on Art.14 would apply to the industrial tribunal as well inasmuch as there cannot be any direction to regularize the services of a workman in violation of Art.14 of the Constitution. As we would explain hereinafter, this would mean that the industrial court would not issue a direction for regularizing the service of a daily wage worker in those cases where such regularization would tantamount to infringing the provisions of Art.14 of the Constitution. But for that, it would not deter the Industrial Tribunals/Labour Courts from issuing such direction, which the industrial adjudicators otherwise possess, having regard to the provisions of Industrial Disputes Act specifically conferring such powers. This is recognized by the Court even in the aforesaid judgment.

23. For detailed discussion on this aspect, we proceed to discuss the ratio in the case of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (supra). In that case the respondent Karamchari Union had filed two complaints before the Industrial Court, Bombay alleging that the appellant-Corporation had indulged in unfair labour practice qua certain employees who were engaged by the appellant as casual labourers for cleaning the buses between the years 1980-1985. It was stated in the complaints that these employees were made to work every day at least for 8 hours at the depot concerned of the Corporation; the work done by them was of permanent nature but they were being paid a paltry amount; and even when the post of sweepers/cleaners were available in the Corporation, these employees had been kept on casual and temporary basis for years together denying them the benefit of permanency. After adjudication, the Industrial Court held that the Corporation had committed unfair labour practice under items 5 and 9 of Schedule IV to the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practice Act, 1971 (MRTU and PULP Act). As a consequence, it directed the Corporation to pay equal wages to the employees concerned which was being paid to Swachhaks and also pay arrears of wages to them. In the second complaint, the Industrial Court returned the finding that the Corporation was indulging in unfair labour practice under Item 6 of Schedule IV, by continuing these employees on temporary/casual/daily wage basis for years together and thereby depriving them the benefits of permanency. The direction in this complaint was to cease and desist from the unfair labour practice by giving them the status, wages and all other benefits of permanency applicable to the post of cleaners, w.e.f. 3.8.1982. The Corporation challenged these two orders of the Industrial Court before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in five separate Writ Petitions. These were disposed of by the learned Single Judge vide common judgment dated 2.8.2001 holding that complaints were maintainable and the finding of the Industrial Court that the Corporation had indulged in unfair labour practice was also correct. The Corporation challenged the decision of the learned Single Judge by filing LPAs which were dismissed by the Division Bench on 6.5.2005. This is how the matter came before the Supreme Court. One of the contentions raised by the appellants before this Court was that there could not have been a direction by the Industrial Court to give these employees status, wages and other benefits of permanency applicable to the post of cleaners as this direction was contrary to the ratio laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Umadevi (supra). The Court while considering this argument went into the scheme of the MRTU and PULP Act. It was, inter-alia, noticed that complaints relating to unfair labour practice could be filed before the Industrial Court. The Court noted that Section 28 of that Act provides for the procedure for dealing with such complaints and Section 30 enumerates the powers given to the Industrial and Labour Courts to decide the matters before it including those relating to unfair labour practice. On the reading of this section, the Court held that it gives specific power to the Industrial/Labour Courts to declare that an unfair labour practice has been engaged and to direct those persons not only to cease and desist from such unfair labour practice but also to take affirmative action. Section 30(1) conferring such powers is reproduced below:

“30. Powers of Industrial and Labour Courts.- (1)Where a court decides that any person named in the complaint has engaged in, or is engaging in, any unfair labour practice, it may in its order-
(a)declare that an unfair labour practice has been engaged in or is being engaged in by that person, and specify any other person who has engaged in, or is engaging in the unfair labour practice;
(b) direct all such persons to cease and desist from such unfair labour practice, and take such affirmative action (including payment of reasonable compensation to the employee or employees affected by the unfair labour practice, or reinstatement of the employee or employees with or without back wages, or the payment of reasonable compensation), as may in the opinion of the Court be necessary to effectuate the policy of the Act;
(c) where a recognized union has engaged in or is engaging in, any unfair labour practice, direct that its recognition shall be cancelled or that all or any of its rights under sub-section(1) of Section 20 or its right under Section 23 shall be suspended.”
24. It was further noticed that Section 32 of the Act provides that the Court shall have the power to decide all connected matters arising out of any application or a complaint referred to it for decision under any of the provisions of this Act. The Court then extensively quoted from the judgment in Uma Devi in order to demonstrate the exact ratio laid down in the said judgment and thereafter proceeded to formulate the following question and answer thereto:

“The question that arises for consideration is: have the provisions of the MRTU and PULP Act been denuded of the statutory status by the Constitution Bench decision in Umadevi? In our judgment, it is not.”
25. Detailed reasons are given in support of the conclusion stating that the MRTU and PULP Act provides for and empowers the Industrial/Labour Courts to decide about the unfair labour practice committed/being committed by any person and to declare a particular practice to be unfair labour practice if it so found and also to direct such person ceased and desist from unfair labour practice. The provisions contained in Section 30 giving such a power to the Industrial and Labour Courts vis-à-vis the ratio of Uma Devi are explained by the Court in the following terms:

“The power given to the Industrial and Labour Courts under Section 30 is very wide and the affirmative action mentioned therein is inclusive and not exhaustive. Employing badlis, casuals or temporaries and to continue them as such for years, with the object of depriving them of the status and privileges of permanent employees is an unfair labour practice on the part of the employer under Item 6 of Schedule IV. Once such unfair labour practice on the part of the employer is established in the complaint, the Industrial and Labour Courts are empowered to issue preventive as well as positive direction to an erring employer.
The provisions of the MRTU and PULP Act and the powers of the Industrial and Labour Courts provided therein were not at all under consideration in Umadevi. As a matter of fact, the issue like the present one pertaining to unfair labour practice was not at all referred to, considered or decided in Umadevi. Unfair labour practice on the part of the employer in engaging employees as badlis, casuals or temporaries and to continue them as such for years with the object of depriving them of the status and privileges of permanent employees as provided in Item 6 of Schedule IV and the power of the Industrial and Labour Courts under Section 30 of the Act did not fall for adjudication or consideration before the Constitution Bench.
Umadevi does not denude the Industrial and Labour Courts of their statutory power under Section 30 read with Section 32 of the MRTU and PULP Act to order permanency of the workers who have been victims of unfair labour practice on the part of the employer under Item 6 of Schedule IV where the posts on which they have been working exist. Umadevi cannot be held to have overridden the powers of the Industrial and Labour Courts in passing appropriate order under Section 30 of the MRTU and PULP Act, once unfair labour practice on the part of the employer under Item 6 of Schedule IV is established.”
26. The Court also accepted the legal proposition that Courts cannot direct creation of posts, as held in Mahatma Phule Agricultural University vs. Nasik Zilla Sheth Kamgar Union (2001) 7 SCC 346. Referring to this judgment, the Court made it clear that inaction on the part of the State Government to create posts would not mean an unfair labour practice had been committed by the employer (University in that case) and as there were no posts, the direction of the High Court to accord the status of permanency was set aside. The Court also noticed that this legal position had been affirmed in State of Maharashtra vs. R.S.Bhonde (2005) 6 SCC 751. The Court also reiterated that creation and abolition of post and regularization are purely Executive functions, as held in number of judgments and it was not for the Court to arrogate the power of the Executive or the Legislature by directing creation of post and absorbing the workers or continue them in service or pay salary of regular employees. This legal position is summed up in para 41 which reads as under:

“Thus, there is no doubt that creation of posts is not within the domain of judicial functions which obviously pertains to the executive. It is also true that the status of permanency cannot be granted by the Court where no such posts exist and that executive functions and powers with regard to the creation of posts cannot be arrogated by the courts.”
27. However, the Court found that factual position was different in the case before it. Here the post of cleaners in the establishment were in existence. Further, there was a finding of fact recorded that the Corporation had indulged in unfair labour practice by engaging these workers on temporary/causal/daily wage basis and paying them paltry amount even when they were discharging duties of eight hours a day and performing the same duties as that of regular employees.

28. In this backdrop, the Court was of the opinion that direction of the Industrial Court to accord permanency to these employees against the posts which were available, was clearly permissible and with the powers, statutorily conferred upon the Industrial/Labour Courts under Section 30 (1)(b) of the said Act which enables the Industrial adjudicator to take affirmative action against the erring employees and as those powers are of wide amplitude abrogating within its fold a direction to accord permanency.

29. A close scrutiny of the two cases, thus, would reveal that the law laid down in those cases is not contradictory to each other. In U.P. Power Corporation, this Court has recognized the powers of the Labour Court and at the same time emphasized that the Labour Court is to keep in mind that there should not be any direction of regularization if this offends the provisions of Art.14 of the Constitution, on which judgment in Umadevi is primarily founded. On the other hand, in Bhonde case, the Court has recognized the principle that having regard to statutory powers conferred upon the Labour Court/Industrial Court to grant certain reliefs to the workmen, which includes the relief of giving the status of permanency to the contract employees, such statutory power does not get denuded by the judgment in Umadevi’s case. It is clear from the reading of this judgment that such a power is to be exercised when the employer has indulged in unfair labour practice by not filling up the permanent post even when available and continuing to workers on temporary/daily wage basis and taking the same work from them and making them some purpose which were performed by the regular workers but paying them much less wages. It is only when a particular practice is found to be unfair labour practice as enumerated in Schedule IV of MRTP and PULP Act and it necessitates giving direction under Section 30 of the said Act, that the Court would give such a direction.

30. We are conscious of the fact that the aforesaid judgment is rendered under MRTP and PULP Act and the specific provisions of that Act were considered to ascertain the powers conferred upon the Industrial Tribunal/Labour Court by the said Act. At the same time, it also hardly needs to be emphasized the powers of the industrial adjudicator under the Industrial Disputes Act are equally wide. The Act deals with industrial disputes, provides for conciliation, adjudication and settlements, and regulates the rights of the parties and the enforcement of the awards and settlements. Thus, by empowering the adjudicator authorities under the Act, to give reliefs such as a reinstatement of wrongfully dismissed or discharged workmen, which may not be permissible in common law or justified under the terms of the contract between the employer and such workmen, the legislature has attempted to frustrate the unfair labour practices and secure the policy of collective bargaining as a road to industrial peace.

31. In the language of Krishna Iyer, J:

The Industrial Disputes Act is a benign measure, which seeks to pre-empt industrial tensions, provide for the mechanics of dispute- resolutions and set up the necessary infrastructure, so that the energies of the partners in production may not be dissipated in counter-productive battles and the assurance of industrial justice may create a climate of goodwill.” (Life Insurance Corpn. Of India v. D.J.Bahadur 1980 Lab IC 1218, 1226(SC), per Krishna Iyer,J.).
In order to achieve the aforesaid objectives, the Labour Courts/Industrial Tribunals are given wide powers not only to enforce the rights but even to create new rights, with the underlying objective to achieve social justice. Way back in the year 1950 i.e. immediately after the enactment of Industrial Disputes Act, in one of its first and celebrated judgment in the case of Bharat Bank Ltd. V. Employees of Bharat Bank Ltd. [1950] LLJ 921,948-49 (SC) this aspect was highlighted by the Court observing as under:

“In settling the disputes between the employers and the workmen, the function of the tribunal is not confined to administration of justice in accordance with law. It can confer rights and privileges on either party which it considers reasonable and proper, though they may not be within the terms of any existing agreement. It has not merely to interpret or give effect to the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. It can create new rights and obligations between them which it considers essential for keeping industrial peace.”
32. At the same time, the aforesaid sweeping power conferred upon the Tribunal is not unbridled and is circumscribed by this Court in the case of New Maneckchowk Spinning & Weaving Co.Ltd.v. Textile Labour Association [1961] 1 LLJ 521,526 (SC) in the following words:

“This, however, does not mean that an industrial court can do anything and everything when dealing with an industrial dispute. This power is conditioned by the subject matter with which it is dealing and also by the existing industrial law and it would not be open to it while dealing with a particular matter before it to overlook the industrial law relating to the matter as laid down by the legislature or by this Court.”
33. It is, thus, this fine balancing which is required to be achieved while adjudicating a particular dispute, keeping in mind that the industrial disputes are settled by industrial adjudication on principle of fair play and justice.

34. On harmonious reading of the two judgments discussed in detail above, we are of the opinion that when there are posts available, in the absence of any unfair labour practice the Labour Court would not give direction for regularization only because a worker has continued as daily wage worker/adhoc/temporary worker for number of years. Further, if there are no posts available, such a direction for regularization would be impermissible. In the aforesaid circumstances giving of direction to regularize such a person, only on the basis of number of years put in by such a worker as daily wager etc. may amount to backdoor entry into the service which is an anathema to Art.14 of the Constitution. Further, such a direction would not be given when the concerned worker does not meet the eligibility requirement of the post in question as per the Recruitment Rules. However, wherever it is found that similarly situated workmen are regularized by the employer itself under some scheme or otherwise and the workmen in question who have approached Industrial/Labour Court are at par with them, direction of regularization in such cases may be legally justified, otherwise, non-regularization of the left over workers itself would amount to invidious discrimination qua them in such cases and would be violative of Art.14 of the Constitution. Thus, the Industrial adjudicator would be achieving the equality by upholding Art. 14, rather than violating this constitutional provision.

35. The aforesaid examples are only illustrated. It would depend on the facts of each case as to whether order of regularization is necessitated to advance justice or it has to be denied if giving of such a direction infringes upon the employer’s rights

36. In the aforesaid backdrop, we revert the facts of the present case. The grievance of the appellants was that under the Scheme contained in Circular dated 6.5.1997 many similarly placed workmen have been regularized and, therefore, they were also entitled to this benefit. It is argued that those who had rendered 240 days service were regularized as per the provision in that Scheme/Circular dated 6.5.1987.

37. On consideration of the cases before us we find that appellant No.1 was not in service on the date when Scheme was promulgated i.e. as on 6.5.1987 as his services were dispensed with 4 years before that Circular saw the light of the day. Therefore, in our view, the relief of monetary compensation in lieu of reinstatement would be more appropriate in his case and the conclusion in the impugned judgment qua him is unassailable, though for the difficult reasons (as recorded by us above) than those advanced by the High Court. However, in so far as appellant No.2 is concerned, he was engaged on 5.9.1986 and continued till 15.9.1990 when his services were terminated. He even raised the Industrial dispute immediately thereafter. Thus, when the Circular dated 5.9.1987 was issued, he was in service and within few months of the issuing of that Circular he had completed 240 days of service.

38. Non-regularization of appellant No.2, while giving the benefit of that Circular dated 6.5.1987 to other similar situated employees and regularizing them would, therefore, be clearly discriminatory. On these facts, the CGIT rightly held that he was entitled to the benefit of scheme contained in Circular dated 6.5.1987. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment has failed to notice this pertinent and material fact which turns the scales in favour of appellant No.2. High Court committed error in reversing the direction given by the CGIT, which was rightly affirmed by the learned Single Judge as well, to reinstate appellant No.2 with 50% back wages and to regularize him in service. He was entitled to get his case considered in terms of that Circular. Had it been done, probably he would have been regularized. Instead, his services were wrongly and illegally terminated in the year 1990. As an upshot of the aforesaid discussion, we allow these appeals partly. While dismissing the appeal qua appellant No.1, the same is accepted in so far as appellant No.2 is concerned. In his case, the judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and the award of the CGIT is restored. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.",5
Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and others,"The present appeal, by special leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.11.2012 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Appeal No. 2531 of 2012 whereby the Division Bench has affirmed the judgment and order dated 21.7.2011 in W.P. No. 25673 of 2007 whereunder the learned single Judge had allowed the writ petition, and after setting aside the punishment of dismissal, directed reinstatement of the respondent with continuity of service but without back wages.

3. Bereft of unnecessary details, the expose’ of facts that have been undraped are that the respondent was appointed as a Surveyor in Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (for short, “CMWSSB”) and subsequently promoted as Junior Engineer in 1989. From 28.8.1995 he remained continuously absent from duty without any intimation to the employer and did not respond to the repeated memoranda/reminders requiring him to explain his unauthorized absence from duty and to rejoin duty. On 1.4.1997 he reported to duty with the medical certificate for his absence from duty for the period commencing 28.8.1995 to 31.3.1997. As he had already remained unauthorisedly absent and did not respond to the memos by offering an explanation, a charge-sheet had already been issued on 11.9.1996 under the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations, 1978 (for brevity “the Regulations”). The charge memo contained two charges, namely, that the respondent-herein had failed to submit an explanation to the first charge memo dated 11.10.1995 inspite of reminders and second, he deserted his post by remaining unauthorisedly absent from duty from 28.8.1995, and thereby committed misconduct under Regulations 6(1) and 6(2) respectively of the Regulations. Be it noted, though the charge memo was duly acknowledged by the respondent on 19.11.1996, yet he chose not to submit his explanation till 6.1.1997, much after the charge- sheet was issued.

4. As the factual matrix would further uncurtain, an enquiry was conducted against the respondent and his explanation in the enquiry was that he could not attend to the duties and could not give explanation to the first charge memo because of ill health. The enquiry officer found charges were proved and, accordingly, submitted the enquiry report which was accepted by the disciplinary authority and after following the due procedure punishment of dismissal was passed on 16.4.1998. In the order of dismissal disciplinary authority observed that belated submission of medical certificate on 1.4.1997 irresistibly led to the conclusion that the respondent employee was unauthorisedly absent from 28.8.1995. A conclusion was also arrived at that the first charge, namely, that he had not responded to the letters and reminders, also stood proved. Being of this view, the disciplinary authority thought it apt to impose the punishment of dismissal from service and he did so.

5. On an appeal being preferred by the respondent the Board rejected the appeal dated 30.6.1998. Being dissatisfied by the order of dismissal and the affirmation thereof in appeal, the respondent preferred W.P. No. 15272 of 1998. The learned Single Judge, by order dated 12.3.2003, directed re-consideration of the appeal solely on the ground that the Managing Director who was the disciplinary authority had taken part in the proceedings of the Board which decided the appeal. After the said order came to be passed, the matter was again placed before the Board and the appellate authority, considering the enquiry report, the evidence brought on record and after due discussion, affirmed the order of disciplinary authority and consequently dismissed the appeal on 1.7.2003.

6. The grievance of re-affirmation of the order of dismissal was agitated by the respondent in W.P. No. 25673 of 2007 which was preferred on 7.7.2007. The appellant-Board in the counter affidavit, defending the order of dismissal, stated that the only reason given by the employee was that he could not attend the duties as he was availing continuous treatment for tuberculosis and, further, he also met with an accident in September 1995 which was unacceptable. In addition, it was stated in the counter affidavit that bunch of medical certificates was produced by him on 1.4.1997 which mentioned that he was suffering from depressive psychosis and bronchitis and there was no mention about any accident and injury sustained by him in September 1995 and treatment availed by him.

7. The learned Single Judge, by the impugned judgment, after narrating the facts, noted the statement of the learned counsel for the respondent that even if the employee had absented from duty, there was no past misconduct of desertion/absence and, therefore, the punishment of dismissal from service for the first time desertion/absenteeism is too harsh and disproportionate and deserved to be interfered with. The learned Single Judge did not advert to any other facet and referred to the decisions in Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya v. Commissioner of Police, Delhi[1], B. C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India[2], V. Ramana v. A.P. SRTC[3], Jagdish Singh v. Punjab Engineering College[4] and Division Bench judgment in V. Senthurvelan v. High Court of Judicature at Madras[5] and opined thus:-

“10. Applying the said judgment to the fact of this case and considering the counter filed by the respondents wherein it is not stated as to whether the petitioner has deserted / absented on any previous occasion, this Court is of the view that this writ petition deserves to be allowed.

11. This writ petition is allowed with a direction to the respondent to reinstate petitioner with continuity of service but without backwage, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.”

8. Grieved by the aforesaid order the CMWSSB preferred Writ Appeal No. 2531 of 2012 and the Division Bench accepted the conclusion of the learned single Judge by stating thus: -

“It is not in dispute that the respondent/ writ petitioner was unwell during the said period, though there might have been some discrepancies in the date of the certificate issued, it has not been controverted by the appellant that the respondent/writ petitioner was suffering from depressive psychosis and bronchitis. That apart it has also not been disputed that the respondent/ writ petitioner had not suffered any earlier punishment while in the services of the appellant Board from the date of his appointment. Therefore, in such circumstances, it would be very harsh and unreasonable to impose the punishment of removal from service for the charge of unauthorized absence, as such punishment is awarded for acts of grave nature or as cumulative effect of continued misconduct or for such other reasons, where the charges are very serious and in case where charge of corruption had been proved. Admittedly, there has been no such allegation against the respondent/writ petitioner. Further, the learned single Judge while setting aside the order of dismissal from service, rightly denied back wages to the respondent/writ petitioner as the respondent/writ petitioner failed to discharge duty during the relevant period.” [Underlining is ours]

9. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material brought on record.

10. On a keen scrutiny of the decision rendered by the learned single Judge as well as that of the Division Bench it is clearly demonstrable that there has been no advertence with regard to the issue whether the charges levelled against the respondent had been proved or not. It is manifest that there had been no argument on the said score before the writ court or in intra- court appeal and hence, we are obliged to state that the only aspect which was really proponed before the High Court pertains to the nature of charges and proportionality of punishment. Therefore, we shall confine our analysis with regard to said limited sphere and an added facet which the learned counsel for the appellant has emphatically urged before us, that is, the belated approach by the respondent in invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court.

11. The charges that were levelled against the respondent-employee read as follows: -

“CHARGE NO. 1:

That he has failed to offer his explanation to this office Memo dated 11.10.95 in spite of reminders thereon dated 20.01.96 and 23.04.96 which clearly shows his disobedience to the order of superior and it amounts to misconduct under Regulation 6(1) of the MMWSS Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations 1978.

CHARGE NO. 2:

That he has deserted the post from 28.08.95 onwards and remains unauthorisedly absent from duty which amounts to misconduct under Regulation 6(2) of the MMWSS Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations 1978.”

12. It is not in dispute that the Inquiry Officer found that both the charges had been proved. The disciplinary authority had ascribed reasons and passed an order of dismissal from service. On a perusal of the order of dismissal it is vivid that the medical certificate was belatedly submitted and he had remained unauthorisedly absent from 28.08.1995. The question that arises is when the charges of unauthorized absence for a long period had been proven, was it justified on the part of the High Court to take resort to the doctrine of proportionality and direct reinstatement in service. That apart, one aspect which has not at all been addressed to by the High Court is that the respondent invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court after four years.

13. First, we shall deal with the facet of delay. In Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation v. Balwant Regular Motor Service, Amravati and others[6] the Court referred to the principle that has been stated by Sir Barnes Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd, Abram Farewall, and John Kemp[7], which is as follows: -

“Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.”

14. In State of Maharashtra v. Digambar[8], while dealing with exercise of power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, the Court observed that power of the High Court to be exercised under Article 226 of the Constitution, if is discretionary, its exercise must be judicious and reasonable, admits of no controversy. It is for that reason, a person’s entitlement for relief from a High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, be it against the State or anybody else, even if is founded on the allegation of infringement of his legal right, has to necessarily depend upon unblameworthy conduct of the person seeking relief, and the court refuses to grant the discretionary relief to such person in exercise of such power, when he approaches it with unclean hands or blameworthy conduct.

15. In State of M.P. and others etc. etc. v. Nandlal Jaiswal and others etc. etc.[9] the Court observed that it is well settled that power of the High Court to issue an appropriate writ under Article 226 of the Constitution is discretionary and the High Court in exercise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. It has been further stated therein that if there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in filing a petition and such delay is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may decline to intervene and grant relief in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. Emphasis was laid on the principle of delay and laches stating that resort to the extraordinary remedy under the writ jurisdiction at a belated stage is likely to cause confusion and public inconvenience and bring in injustice.

16. Thus, the doctrine of delay and laches should not be lightly brushed aside. A writ court is required to weigh the explanation offered and the acceptability of the same. The court should bear in mind that it is exercising an extraordinary and equitable jurisdiction. As a constitutional court it has a duty to protect the rights of the citizens but simultaneously it is to keep itself alive to the primary principle that when an aggrieved person, without adequate reason, approaches the court at his own leisure or pleasure, the Court would be under legal obligation to scrutinize whether the lis at a belated stage should be entertained or not. Be it noted, delay comes in the way of equity. In certain circumstances delay and laches may not be fatal but in most circumstances inordinate delay would only invite disaster for the litigant who knocks at the doors of the Court. Delay reflects inactivity and inaction on the part of a litigant – a litigant who has forgotten the basic norms, namely, “procrastination is the greatest thief of time” and second, law does not permit one to sleep and rise like a phoenix. Delay does bring in hazard and causes injury to the lis. In the case at hand, though there has been four years’ delay in approaching the court, yet the writ court chose not to address the same. It is the duty of the court to scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be ignored without any justification. That apart, in the present case, such belated approach gains more significance as the respondent-employee being absolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a lackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remained unauthorisedly absent on the pretext of some kind of ill health. We repeat at the cost of repetition that remaining innocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the cause of justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for it is likely to affect others. Such delay may have impact on others’ ripened rights and may unnecessarily drag others into litigation which in acceptable realm of probability, may have been treated to have attained finality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such indolent persons - who compete with ‘Kumbhakarna’ or for that matter ‘Rip Van Winkle’. In our considered opinion, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and on the said ground alone the writ court should have thrown the petition overboard at the very threshold.

17. Having dealt with the doctrine of delay and laches, we shall presently proceed to deal with the doctrine of proportionality which has been taken recourse to by the High Court regard being had to the obtaining factual matrix. We think it appropriate to refer to some of the authorities which have been placed reliance upon by the High Court.

18. In Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya (supra) this Court opined that the unauthorized absence was not a grave misconduct inasmuch as the employee had proceeded on leave under compulsion because of his grave condition of health. Be it noted, in the said case, it has also been observed that no reasonable disciplinary authority would term absence on medical grounds with proper medical certificate from Government doctors as a grave misconduct.

19. In Jagdish Singh (supra) the Court took note of the fact that the appellant therein was a sweeper and had remained absent on four spells totalling to fifteen days in all in two months. In that context, the Court observed thus: -

“The instant case is not a case of habitual absenteeism. The appellant seems to have a good track record from the date he joined service as a sweeper. In his long career of service, he remained absent for fifteen days on four occasions in the months of February and March 2004. This was primarily to sort out the problem of his daughter with her in-laws. The filial bondage and the emotional attachment might have come in his way to apply and obtain leave from the employer. The misconduct that is alleged, in our view, would definitely amount to violation of discipline that is expected of an employee to maintain in the establishment, but may not fit into the category of gross violation of discipline. We hasten to add, if it were to be habitual absenteeism, we would not have ventured to entertain this appeal.”

20. If both the decisions are appositely understood, two aspects clearly emerge. In Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya (supra), the Court took note of the fact, that is, production of proper medical certificate from a Government medical doctor and opined about the nature of misconduct and in Jagdish Singh (supra) the period of absence, status of the employee and his track record and the explanation offered by him. In the case at hand, the factual score being different, to which we shall later on advert, the aforesaid authorities do not really assist the respondent.

21. Learned counsel for the respondent has commended us to the decision in Krushnakant B. Parmar v. Union of India and another[10] to highlight that in the absence of a finding returned by the Inquiry Officer or determination by the disciplinary authority that the unauthorized absence was willful, the charge could not be treated to have been proved. To appreciate the said submission we have carefully perused the said authority. In the said case, the question arose whether “unauthorized absence from duty” did tantamount to “failure of devotion to duty” or “behavior unbecoming of a Government servant” inasmuch as the appellant therein was charge-sheeted for failure to maintain devotion to duty and his behavior was unbecoming of a Government servant. After adverting to the rule position the two-Judge Bench expressed thus: -

“16. In the case of the appellant referring to unauthorized absence the disciplinary authority alleged that he failed to maintain devotion to duty and his behavior was unbecoming of a government servant. The question whether “unauthorized absence from duty” amounts to failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a government servant cannot be decided without deciding the question whether absence is willful or because of compelling circumstances.

17. If the absence is the result of compelling circumstances under which it was not possible to report or perform duty, such absence cannot be held to be willful. Absence from duty without any application or prior permission may amount to unauthorized absence, but it does not always mean willful. There may be different eventualities due to which an employee may abstain from duty, including compelling circumstances beyond his control like illness, accident, hospitalization, etc., but in such case the employee cannot be held guilty of failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a government servant.

18. In a departmental proceeding, if allegation of unauthorized absence from duty is made, the disciplinary authority is required to prove that the absence is willful, in the absence of such finding, the absence will not amount to misconduct.”

22. We have quoted in extenso as we are disposed to think that the Court has, while dealing with the charge of failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a Government servant, expressed the aforestated view and further the learned Judges have also opined that there may be compelling circumstances which are beyond the control of an employee. That apart, the facts in the said case were different as the appellant on certain occasions was prevented to sign the attendance register and the absence was intermittent. Quite apart from that, it has been stated therein that it is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to come to a conclusion that the absence is willful. On an apposite understanding of the judgment we are of the opinion that the view expressed in the said case has to be restricted to the facts of the said case regard being had to the rule position, the nature of the charge levelled against the employee and the material that had come on record during the enquiry. It cannot be stated as an absolute proposition in law that whenever there is a long unauthorized absence, it is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to record a finding that the said absence is willful even if the employee fails to show the compelling circumstances to remain absent.

23. In this context, it is seemly to refer to certain other authorities relating to unauthorized absence and the view expressed by this Court. In State of Punjab v. Dr. P.L. Singla[11] the Court, dealing with unauthorized absence, has stated thus: -

“Unauthorised absence (or overstaying leave), is an act of indiscipline. Whenever there is an unauthorized absence by an employee, two courses are open to the employer. The first is to condone the unauthorized absence by accepting the explanation and sanctioning leave for the period of the unauthorized absence in which event the misconduct stood condoned. The second is to treat the unauthorized absence as a misconduct, hold an enquiry and impose a punishment for the misconduct.”

24. Again, while dealing with the concept of punishment the Court ruled as follows: -

“Where the employee who is unauthorisedly absent does not report back to duty and offer any satisfactory explanation, or where the explanation offered by the employee is not satisfactory, the employer will take recourse to disciplinary action in regard to the unauthorized absence. Such disciplinary proceedings may lead to imposition of punishment ranging from a major penalty like dismissal or removal from service to a minor penalty like withholding of increments without cumulative effect. The extent of penalty will depend upon the nature of service, the position held by the employee, the period of absence and the cause/explanation for the absence.”

25. In Tushar D. Bhatt v. State of Gujarat and another[12], the appellant therein had remained unauthorisedly absent for a period of six months and further had also written threatening letters and conducted some other acts of misconduct. Eventually, the employee was visited with order of dismissal and the High Court had given the stamp of approval to the same. Commenting on the conduct of the appellant the Court stated that he was not justified in remaining unauthorisedly absent from official duty for more than six months because in the interest of discipline of any institution or organization such an approach and attitude of the employee cannot be countenanced.

26. Thus, the unauthorized absence by an employee, as a misconduct, cannot be put into a straight-jacket formula for imposition of punishment. It will depend upon many a factor as has been laid down in Dr. P.L. Singla (supra).

27. Presently, we shall proceed to scrutinize whether the High Court is justified in applying the doctrine of proportionality. Doctrine of proportionality in the context of imposition of punishment in service law gets attracted when the court on the analysis of material brought on record comes to the conclusion that the punishment imposed by the Disciplinary Authority or the appellate authority shocks the conscience of the court. In this regard a passage from Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and another v. Ashok Kumar Arora[13] is worth reproducing: -

“At the outset, it needs to be mentioned that the High Court in such cases of departmental enquiries and the findings recorded therein does not exercise the powers of appellate court/authority. The jurisdiction of the High Court in such cases is very limited for instance where it is found that the domestic enquiry is vitiated because of non-observance of principles of natural justice, denial of reasonable opportunity; findings are based on no evidence, and/or the punishment is totally disproportionate to the proved misconduct of an employee.”

28. In Union of India and another v. G. Ganayutham[14], the Court analysed the conception of proportionality in administrative law in England and India and thereafter addressed itself with regard to the punishment in disciplinary matters and opined that unless the court/tribunal opines in its secondary role that the administrator was, on the material before him, irrational according to Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn.[15] and Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil Service[16] norms, the punishment cannot be quashed.

29. In Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Coal India Limited and another v. Mukul Kumar Choudhuri and others[17], the Court, after analyzing the doctrine of proportionality at length, ruled thus: -

“19. The doctrine of proportionality is, thus, well-recognised concept of judicial review in our jurisprudence. What is otherwise within the discretionary domain and sole power of the decision-maker to quantify punishment once the charge of misconduct stands proved, such discretionary power is exposed to judicial intervention if exercised in a manner which is out of proportion to the fault. Award of punishment which is grossly in excess to the allegations cannot claim immunity and remains open for interference under limited scope of judicial review.

20. One of the tests to be applied while dealing with the question of quantum of punishment would be: would any reasonable employer have imposed such punishment in like circumstances? Obviously, a reasonable employer is expected to take into consideration measure, magnitude and degree of misconduct and all other relevant circumstances and exclude irrelevant matters before imposing punishment.

21. In a case like the present one where the misconduct of the delinquent was unauthorized absence from duty for six months but upon being charged of such misconduct, he fairly admitted his guilt and explained the reason for his absence by stating that he did not have intention nor desired to disobey the order of higher authority or violate any of the Company’s rules and regulations but the reason was purely personal and beyond his control and, as a matter of fact, he sent his resignation which was not accepted, the order of removal cannot be held to be justified, since in our judgment, no reasonable employer would have imposed extreme punishment of removal in like circumstances. The punishment is not only unduly harsh but grossly in excess to the allegations.”

30. After so stating the two-Judge Bench proceeded to say that one of the tests to be applied while dealing with the question of quantum of punishment is whether any reasonable employer would have imposed such punishment in like circumstances taking into consideration the major, magnitude and degree of misconduct and all other relevant circumstances after excluding irrelevant matters before imposing punishment. It is apt to note here that in the said case the respondent had remained unauthorisedly absent from duty for six months and admitted his guilt and explained the reasons for his absence by stating that he neither had any intention nor desire to disobey the order of superior authority or violated any of the rules or regulations but the reason was purely personal and beyond his control. Regard being had to the obtaining factual matrix, the Court interfered with the punishment on the ground of proportionality. The facts in the present case are quite different. As has been seen from the analysis made by the High Court, it has given emphasis on past misconduct of absence and first time desertion and thereafter proceeded to apply the doctrine of proportionality. The aforesaid approach is obviously incorrect. It is telltale that the respondent had remained absent for a considerable length of time. He had exhibited adamantine attitude in not responding to the communications from the employer while he was unauthorisedly absent. As it appears, he has chosen his way, possibly nurturing the idea that he can remain absent for any length of time, apply for grant of leave at any time and also knock at the doors of the court at his own will. Learned counsel for the respondent has endeavoured hard to impress upon us that he had not been a habitual absentee. We really fail to fathom the said submission when the respondent had remained absent for almost one year and seven months. The plea of absence of “habitual absenteeism” is absolutely unacceptable and, under the obtaining circumstances, does not commend acceptation. We are disposed to think that the respondent by remaining unauthorisedly absent for such a long period with inadequate reason had not only shown indiscipline but also made an attempt to get away with it. Such a conduct is not permissible and we are inclined to think that the High Court has erroneously placed reliance on the authorities where this Court had interfered with the punishment. We have no shadow of doubt that the doctrine of proportionality does not get remotely attracted to such a case. The punishment is definitely not shockingly disproportionate.

31. Another aspect needs to be noted. The respondent was a Junior Engineer. Regard being had to his official position, it was expected of him to maintain discipline, act with responsibility, perform his duty with sincerity and serve the institution with honesty. This kind of conduct cannot be countenanced as it creates a concavity in the work culture and ushers in indiscipline in an organization. In this context, we may fruitfully quote a passage from Government of India and another v. George Philip[18]: -

“In a case involving overstay of leave and absence from duty, granting six months’ time to join duty amounts to not only giving premium to indiscipline but is wholly subversive of the work culture in the organization. Article 51-A(j) of the Constitution lays down that it shall be the duty of every citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. This cannot be achieved unless the employees maintain discipline and devotion to duty. Courts should not pass such orders which instead of achieving the underlying spirit and objects of Part IV-A of the Constitution have the tendency to negate or destroy the same.”

32. We respectfully reiterate the said feeling and re-state with the hope that employees in any organization should adhere to discipline for not only achieving personal excellence but for collective good of an organization. When we say this, we may not be understood to have stated that the employers should be harsh to impose grave punishment on any misconduct. An amiable atmosphere in an organization develops the work culture and the employer and the employees are expected to remember the same as a precious value for systemic development.

33. Judged on the anvil of the aforesaid premises, the irresistible conclusion is that the interference by the High Court with the punishment is totally unwarranted and unsustainable, and further the High Court was wholly unjustified in entertaining the writ petition after a lapse of four years. The result of aforesaid analysis would entail overturning the judgments and orders passed by the learned single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court and, accordingly, we so do.

34. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the judgments and orders passed by the High Court are set aside leaving the parties to bear their respective costs.",1
State through CBI New Delhi,"We are, in these cases, concerned with the interpretation of various sections that appear in Chapter II read with Chapter III of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short “the PC Act”), especially Sections 3, 4, 5 and other related provisions dealing with offences and penalties appearing in Chapter III of the PC Act.

2. We are, in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008, concerned with the question whether the Special Judge, after framing charges against a Public Servant under 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(b) falling under Section 3(1) of the PC Act and against private persons for offences under Sections 120- B, 420, 467, 468, 471 IPC can go ahead with the trial of the case against the private persons for non-PC offences, even after the death of the sole public servant. In other words, the question is whether, on the death of the sole public servant, the Special Judge will cease to have jurisdiction to continue with the trial against the private persons for non-PC offences. Further question raised is that, assuming that the Special Judge has jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act to proceed against the private persons, is the Special Judge duty bound to try any non- PC offence, other than the offences specified under Section 3 of the PC Act against the accused persons charged at the same trial.

3. In Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011, we are concerned with the question as to whether the Special Judge has jurisdiction under Section 4(3) of the PC Act to try non-PC offences against private persons when no charges have been framed against public servants for trying a case for offences under Section 3(1) of the PC Act, since they died before framing of charges under the PC Act or IPC.

4. We have two conflicting judgments, one rendered by the Delhi High Court, which is impugned in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008 filed by the State through Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), New Delhi and the other rendered by the Bombay High Court, which is challenged by a private person in Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011.

5. Delhi High Court seems to have taken the view that when public servants and non-public servants are arrayed as co-accused and some offences are under the PC Act coupled with other offences under IPC, on death of a public servant, the offences under the PC Act cannot be proceeded with and the trial Court has to modify and/or alter and/or amend the charges. Bombay High Court has taken the view that once the jurisdiction is vested on a Special Judge, the same cannot be divested on the death of a public servant and that if a private person has abetted any offences punishable under the PC Act, he can be tried even without the public servant, in view of the separate charge levelled against such private person by the Special Judge.

6. We may first deal with the facts in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008. The CBI, New Delhi registered a case No. RCSIG 2000/E0001 on 16.5.2000 against one P. K. Samal (A-1), Chief Manager SBI, Jaipur Road, J. K. Singh (A-2), Director M/s Mideast Integrated Steels Ltd. (MISL), New Delhi, Rita Singh (A-3), Director M/s MISL, Deepak Singh (A-4) and Proprietor Kesoram Refractory, New Delhi, under Section 120B read with Sections 420, 467, 471 IPC and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act and substantive offences under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 IPC and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act alleging that A-1, during 1996-97, was a party to a criminal conspiracy with A-2, A-3, A-4 and others with the object of cheating IDBI, Mumbai and in pursuance thereof, A-1 abused his official position to cause undue pecuniary advantage to the accused persons A-2 and A-3 and corresponding loss to IDBI, to the tune of Rs.3,52,63,550/- by negotiating forged /fictitious invoices purportedly of M/s. Kesoram Refractories, a B.K. Birla Group Company, Calcutta, against L.Cs opened by SBI, Jaipur Road.

7. CBI, after completing the investigation, filed charge-sheet on 1.11.2001 before the Special Judge, New Delhi and the Special Judge, on 25.3.2003, after hearing the prosecution as well as the defence counsel, framed charges against the accused persons under Section 120B read with Sections 467, 471 and 420 IPC and also under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the PC Act and substantive offences against the accused persons under Sections 420, 467, 471 IPC and also substantive offences under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the PC Act against A-1. All the accused persons pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

8. The Special Judge, later, posted the case for prosecution evidence on 10.4.2003 and, on that day, two witnesses were present, but the case was adjourned. Meanwhile, on 20.6.2003, the sole public servant A-1 died. A- 3 then filed Criminal Revision No. 550 of 2003 before the High Court of Delhi on 22.7.2003 challenging the order framing the charges against him. The High Court, on 1.8.2003, directed the trial Court to record only the examination-in-chief of the witnesses. Accordingly, the examination-in- chief of 8 prosecution witnesses was recorded on different days. On 28.4.2004, A-2 filed an application before the Special Judge for dropping the charges in view of the death of A-1, the sole public servant. On 12.5.2004, A-2 filed an application before the High Court as Criminal M.C. No. 1395/2004 seeking stay of further proceedings before the trial Court, till charges are amended. The High Court, on 14.5.2004, directed the trial Court to dispose of the application filed by A-2 for modification, amendment or alteration of charges on account of death of A-1 and further directed if the Court feels it necessary, it may add, alter or amend the charges and proceed in accordance with law.

9. CBI, however, filed objection to the above application before the Special Judge on 20.5.2004. A-2, on 12.7.2005, filed Criminal Revision No. 535 of 2005 before the High Court for calling of the case pending before the Special Judge, so as to consider the propriety of not passing any order on the application for dropping the charges, despite the directions issued by the High Court. He also prayed for setting aside the charges in view of the death of the sole public servant. CBI questioned the maintainability of the revision and also pointed out that there is no statutory provision vitiating the jurisdiction of the Special Judge on death of the public servant. The High Court, however, placing reliance on its earlier judgement in Kartongen Kemi Ochforvaltning AB v. State through CBI (2004) 1 JCC 218 (Bofors case) held that on the death of a public servant, the offences under the PC Act cannot be proceeded with and directed to modify and alter and/or amend the charges in view of the death of A-1, the legality of which is under challenge in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008.

10. We may now examine the facts in Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011. CBI (Banks Securities & Fraud Cell), Mumbai registered an FIR on 2.7.1996 which discloses that accused no. 1, the then Chairman and Managing Director of the Bank of Maharashtra, Pune, who was working as Deputy General Manager of Bank of Maharashtra along with accused nos. 9 and 10, the employees of the Bank of Maharashtra, entered into a criminal conspiracy with an intent to cheat the bank, with the appellant (accused no. 2) and accused Nos. 3 and 5, who were working as the Managing Director, General Manager of M/s Orson Electronics Limited respectively. It was also alleged in the FIR that, during 1986-88, A-2 and other accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy with the officers of the Bank of Maharashtra and, in pursuance to the criminal conspiracy, obtained huge credit facilities to the tune of Rs.20 crore in favour of M/s Orson Electronics Limited and M/s Nihon Electronics Limited, of which A-2 was the Managing Director/Director, knowing very well that both the companies were having very low capital and were new. It was also alleged in the FIR that those funds were not utilized for the purpose for which the same were obtained from the bank and were siphoned off through M/s Orson Electronics Limited and other fictitious firms. Consequently, accused persons failed to repay the funds of the bank, thereby the bank was cheated to the tune of Rs.20.64 crores. It was also alleged in the FIR that A-1 had abused his position as public servant and granted favour to A-2 to A-8 and thereby caused wrongful losses to the bank.

11. CBI completed the investigation and the charge-sheet was filed on 14.9.2001 against the accused persons for offences punishable inter alia under Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC and Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, corresponding to Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act, in the Court of Special Judge, Mumbai.

12. Accused nos. 9 and 10, though named in the charge-sheet, could not be sent for trial since they died before the charge-sheet came to be filed on 14.9.2001. On 18.2.2005, A-1, the sole public servant also expired. A- 2, the appellant herein, then preferred an application before the Special Judge for sending the case to the Metropolitan Magistrate at Bombay for conducting the trial for offences under IPC, as the offence under the PC Act was not attracted due to the death of the public servant. It was pointed out that, in the charge-sheet, two public servants were joined as accused persons, but only one of them was alive when the charge-sheet was filed. Further, it was stated that when the charges were sought to be framed, no public servant was alive, hence, no charges under the PC Act could be framed. In the absence of any offence under the PC Act, the Special Judge could not have tried the offences levelled against the accused persons under the IPC. The application was, however, opposed by CBI stating that even though the sole public servant had died, the offence levelled against the accused persons could be tried by the Special Judge.

13. The Special Judge, after hearing the parties, passed the following order:

“9. On going through the above ratios, it can be said that the existence of public servant for facing trial before the Special Court is must and in his absence, private person cannot be tried by Special Court. In present case, the sole public servant died during the pendency of this case. The charge is not framed. The accused Nos. 2 to 8 are private persons facing trial for the offences punishable under Section 409 r/w 120-B of IPC. The said offences are triable by the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Therefore, the case is required to be sent to Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for trial as per the law. With this, I pass the following order:-
ORDER Misc. Application (Exh. 18) is allowed.
Registrar (S) is directed to send case papers of Spl. Case No.88 of 2001 to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for trial of accused according to law within period of four weeks from the date of this order.
Misc. Application (Exh.18) stands disposed of.
Sd/- 5.2.09 (S.P. Tavade) Special Judge for CBI Cases Greater Mumbai.”
14. CBI, aggrieved by the said order, preferred Criminal Revision Application No. 389/2009 before the Bombay High Court. The High Court took the view that the jurisdiction conferred on the Special Judge is not divested on the death of an accused. The High Court held that, upon death, the case against that public servant alone abates and the rest of them can be proceeded against by the Special Judge, since the Court, once vested with the jurisdiction, cannot be divested of it on the death of a public servant. Consequently, the order passed by the Special Judge was set aside and the Special Judge, CBI, Bombay was directed to continue with the trial of the case. Aggrieved by the same, Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011 has been preferred by A-2.

15. Shri P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for CBI in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008, referred to Sections 3(1) and 4(1) of the PC Act and submitted that irrespective of whether the offence mentioned in Section 3(1) was committed by a public servant or a private person, individually or jointly, trial could be conducted only by the Special Judge who is conferred with the jurisdiction by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, under the PC Act. Shri Malhotra submitted that on the death of a public servant, the jurisdiction once vested on the Special Judge cannot be divested. Further, it was also pointed out that once the public servant dies, the charge against him alone would abate, but the jurisdiction of the Court would not be divested. It was stated that the direction issued by the High Court was contrary to the statutory provisions and settled principles of law and is liable to be set aside.

16. Shri K. Radhakrishnan, learned senior counsel appearing for the CBI in Criminal Appeal no. 161 of 2011, highlighted the objects and reasons of the PC Act and submitted that once the jurisdiction to try the offence under the PC Act, as well as the offence under IPC, has been conferred on a Special Judge, it cannot be divested by the act of parties, even on the death of a public servant.

17. Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel and amicus curiae, submitted that once jurisdiction is conferred on a Special Judge, it cannot be divested by the subsequent events and on death of the public servant only the charge against him will abate, but the jurisdiction of the Special Judge will not be divested.

18. Shri Kawal Nain, learned counsel appearing for the respondents in Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008, also traced the legislative history of the PC Act as well as the jurisdiction of the ordinary Criminal Court under the Code, with specific reference to Section 3 of the PC Act read with Section 13(1)(d)(i)(ii) of the PC Act and Section 120B of the IPC. Learned counsel pointed out that the charge against public servant under Section 13(1)(d)(i)(ii) has abated on his death, consequently, it would not be possible for the Special Judge to try any offence as against the respondents, since both are intrinsically interlinked. Learned counsel pointed out that to establish an offence of conspiracy, there must be two or more persons as stated in Section 120A IPC.

19. Shri R. Basant, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011, has taken the stand that the Special Judge has no jurisdiction under Section 4(3) of the PC Act to try the offences punishable under Section 409 read with Section 120B IPC against the appellant, since there is no public servant in the array of accused persons. Learned senior counsel submitted, assuming that the Special Judge has jurisdiction under Section 4(3) of the PC Act, still the Special Judge has the discretion to decide as to whether he should try any offence, other than the offence specified in Section 3 of the PC Act. It was pointed out that the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to try offences specified under Sections 3(a) and (b) is not only in respect of offences punishable under the PC Act, but also non-PC offences in view of Section 4(3) of the PC Act, which is only an enabling provision. Further, it was also pointed out that when exclusive jurisdiction is conferred on the Special Judge, while trying offences under Section 3(1)(a) and (b) against public servant as well as the private persons, the discretion is also conferred on the Special Judge under Section 4(3) to try non-PC offences as well against private persons. On the basis of the above legal premises, learned senior counsel pointed out that, in the instant case, since no charges have been framed against the public servant under Section 3(1) of the PC Act and that the public servant is no more, the discretion exercised by the Special Judge under Section 4(3) of the PC Act should not have been interfered with by the High Court.

20. We may, before examining the rival contentions raised by the parties, deal with the objects and reasons for enacting the PC Act. The Indian Penal Code has provided for punishment for the offence of bribery and corruption even against the public servants. Parliament, in its wisdom, noticed that the Penal Code was not adequate to meet the exigencies of time and a need was felt to introduce a special legislation with a view to eradicate the evil of bribery and corruption from the society. Consequently, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 was enacted, which was amended in the year 1964, based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee. Parliament still felt that the anti-corruption laws should be made more effective, by widening their coverage and enhancing penalties and to expedite the proceedings and hence the 1988 Act was enacted.

21. Chapter II of the PC Act deals with the appointment of Special Judges and Chapter III deals with the offences and penalties. Section 3 of the PC Act deals with the power to appoint Special Judges, which is extracted hereunder for an easy reference:

“3. Power to appoint special Judges.- (1) The Central Government or the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint as many special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas or for such case or group of cases as may be specified in the notification to try the following offences, namely:-
a) any offence punishable under this Act; and
b) any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified in clause (a).
(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a special Judge under this Act unless he is or has been a Sessions Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge or an Assistant Sessions Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974).” Section 4 of the PC Act deals with the cases triable by Special Judges.
The same is also extracted below:

“4. Cases triable by special Judges.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), or in any other law for the time being in force, the offences specified in sub- section (1) of section 3 shall be tried by special Judges only.
(2) Every offence specified in sub- section (1) of section 3 shall be tried by the special Judge for the area within which it was committed, or, as the case may be, by the special Judge appointed for the case, or where there are more special Judges than one for such area, by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government.
(3) When trying any case, a special Judge may also try any offence, other than an offence specified in section 3, with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be charged at the same trial.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), a special Judge shall, as far as practicable, hold the trial of an offence on day- to- day basis.” Section 5 of the PC Act deals with the procedure and powers of Special Judge. The same also has some relevance and is extracted below for an easy reference:

“5. Procedure and powers of special Judge.- (1) A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and, in trying the accused persons, shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), for the trial of warrant case by Magistrates.
(2) A special Judge may, with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, an offence, tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned, whether as principal or abettor, in the commission thereof and any pardon so tendered shall, for the purposes of sub- sections (1) to (5) of section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), be deemed to have been tendered under section 307 of that Code.
(3) Save as provided in sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974 .), shall, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act, apply to the proceedings before a special Judge; and for the purposes of the said provisions, the Court of the special Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of Session and the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor.
(4) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub- section (3), the provisions of sections 326 and 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), shall, so far as may be, apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions, a special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate.
(5) A special Judge may pass upon any person convicted by him any sentence authorised by law for the punishment of the offence of which such person is convicted.
(6) A special Judge, while trying an offence punishable, under this Act, shall exercise all the powers and functions exercisable by a District Judge under the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 (Ord. 38 of 1944).”
22. Section 3(1) of the PC Act confers power on the Central Government or the State Government to appoint as many Special Judges as may be necessary, for such area or areas or for such cases or group of cases as will be specified in the notification to be issued in the Official Gazette. The Special Judge is so empowered to try any offence punishable under Section 3(1)(a) of the PC Act. The Special Judge is also empowered to try under Section 3(1)(b) any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the offences specified in clause (a). To make it more precise, following offences would come within the scope of Section 3(1) of the PC Act:

    (1)    Any offence punishable under the PC Act.
    (2)    Any conspiracy to commit any offence  punishable  under  the  PC
           Act.
    (3)    Any attempt to commit any offence punishable under the PC Act.
    (4)    Any abetment of any offence punishable under the PC Act.
23. Let us examine what are the offences specified in Clause (a) of Section 3(1) of the PC Act, for which reference has to be made to Chapter III of the PC Act.

24. Section 7 of the PC Act refers to offences dealing with public servant taking gratification, other than the legal remuneration in respect of an official act. Section 10 deals with punishment for abetment by a public servant of offences defined in Sections 8 and 9. Section 11 of the PC Act refers to an offence of a public servant obtaining valuable thing, without consideration from person concerned in proceeding or business transacted by such public servant. Offences under Sections 7, 10 and 11 can be committed only by the public servant, though an offence under Section 7 can also be committed by a person expected to be a public servant. An offence under Section 7 or 11 could also be abetted by a non- public servant, for which punishment has been prescribed under Section 12 of the PC Act. Section 8 deals with the taking gratification, by corrupt or illegal means, to influence public servant. Section 9 deals with taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant. Offences under Sections 8 and 9 can be committed by a person who need not necessarily be a public servant. An offence under Sections 8, 9 or 12 can be committed by a public servant or by a private person or by combination of both. Section 13 deals with the criminal misconduct by a public servant, which is exclusively an offence against the public servant relating to criminal misconduct. An offence under Sections 13 is made punishable under Section 15 of the PC Act. The above discussion would indicate that a public servant as well as a non-public servant can commit offences punishable under the PC Act.

25. A Special Judge appointed under Section 3(1) of the PC Act has got jurisdiction to proceed exclusively against a public servant and exclusively against a non-public servant as well, depending upon the nature of the offence referred to in Chapter III of the PC Act. Junction of a public servant is not a must for the Special Judge to proceed against a non- public servant for any offence alleged to have been committed by him under Chapter III of the PC Act. As already indicated, an offence under Section 8 or Section 9 can be committed by non-public servant and he can be proceeded against under the PC Act without joinder of any public servant. For example:

- Section 7 of the Act uses the words “Whoever, being, or expecting to be a public servant….”
- Sections 10 and 11 of the Act use the words “Whoever, being a public servant….”.
- Section 13 uses the words “A public servant is said to commit…..”.
26. Thus, offences under Sections 7, 10, 11 and 13 of the PC Act can be committed by a public servant though an offence under Section 7 can be committed also by a “person expected to be a public servant”. On the other hand:

- Section 8 uses the words “whoever…”, simpliciter, without using any other qualifying words.
- Likewise, Sections 9 and 12 also use the words “whoever…” simpliciter.
27. Thus, an offence under Sections 8, 9 or 12 can be committed by any person, who need not necessarily be a public servant. Such an offence can, therefore, be committed by a public servant or by a private person or by a combination of the two. It is thus clear that an offence under the PC Act can be committed by either a public servant or a private person or a combination of both and in view of the mandate of Section 4(1) of the PC Act, read with Section 3(1) thereof, such offences can be tried only by a Special Judge.

For example:

- A private person offering a bribe to a public servant commits an offence under Section 12 of Act. This offence can be tried only by the Special Judge, notwithstanding the fact that only a private person is the accused in the case and that there is no public servant named as an accused in that case.
- A private person can be the only accused person in an offence under Section 8 or Section 9 of the said Act. And it is not necessary that a public servant should also be specifically named as an accused in the same case. Notwithstanding the fact that a private person is the only accused in an offence under Section 8 or Section 9, it can be tried only by a Special Judge.
28. Thus, the scheme of the PC Act makes it quite clear that even a private person who is involved in an offence mentioned in Section 3(1) of the PC Act, is required to be tried only by a Special Judge, and by no other Court. Moreover, it is not necessary that in every offence under the PC Act, a public servant must necessarily be an accused. In other words, the existence of a public servant for facing the trial before the Special Court is not a must and even in his absence, private persons can be tried for PC as well as non-PC offences, depending upon the facts of the case.

29. We, therefore, make it clear that it is not the law that only along with the junction of a public servant in array of parties, the Special Judge can proceed against private persons who have committed offences punishable under the PC Act.

30. Sections 3(1)(a) and (b), it may be noted, deal with only the offences punishable under the PC Act and not any offence punishable under IPC or any other law and Section 4(1) of the PC Act makes it more explicit.

31. Section 4(1) of the PC Act has used a non-abstante clause. It says, “notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or in any other law for the time being in force, the offences specified in sub-section (1) of Section 3 shall be tried by special Judges only”. Consequently, the offences referred to in Section 3(1) cannot be tried by the ordinary criminal court, since jurisdiction has been specifically conferred on a Special Judge appointed under Section 3(1) of the PC Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 also makes it clear, which says that every offence specified in sub-section (1) of Section 3 shall be tried by the special Judge for the area within which it was committed, or, as the case may be, by the special Judge appointed for the case, or, where there are more special Judges than one for such area, by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government. A conjoint reading of Section 3(1) along with Sections 4(1) and (2) would make it amply clear that only the Special Judge has got the jurisdiction to try the offences specified in sub-section (1) of Section 3 committed by a public servant or a non-public servant, alone or jointly.

32 We may now examine the scope of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act, which indicates that “when trying any case”, which means trying any case relating to the offences referred to in Section 3(1)(a) and (b) of the PC Act for which exclusive jurisdiction is conferred on the Special Judge. A Special Judge, while exercising, exclusive jurisdiction, that is, when trying any case relating to offences under Sections 3(1)(a) and (b) of the PC Act, may also try any offence other than the offence specified in Section 3, with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 be charged at the same trial. An accused, in a given case, may be charged under the Code of Criminal Procedure on an offence being committed under the IPC and the offence specified in Section 3 of the PC Act. Criminal cases that can be tried by a Special Judge are under the PC Act and also for the charges under IPC or any other legislation. Conspiracy to commit any offence either under the PC Act or under the IPC is a separate offence, has to be separately charged and tried. For example, the conspiracy to commit offence punishable under the PC Act itself is an offence to be tried only by a Special Judge. In Ajay Aggarwal v. Union of India (1993) 3 SCC 609, the Court held as follows:

“….Conspiracy to commit a crime itself is punishable as a substantive offence and every individual offence committed pursuant to the conspiracy is separate and distinct offence to which individual offenders are liable to punishment, independent of the conspiracy. ….”
33. Reference may also be made to the judgments of this Court in Sanichar Sahni v. State of Bihar (2009) 7 SCC 198 and Mohd. Arif v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2011) 13 SCC 621.

34. In other words, an accused person, either a public servant or non- public servant, who has been charged for an offence under Section 3(1) of the PC Act, could also be charged for an offence under IPC, in the event of which, the Special Judge has got the jurisdiction to try such offences against the public servant as well as against a non-public servant. The legal position is also settled by the Judgment of this Court in Vivek Gupta v. CBI and another (2003) 8 SCC 628, wherein this Court held that a public servant who is charged of an offence under the provisions of the PC Act may also be charged by the Special Judge at the same trial of any offence under IPC if the same is committed in a manner contemplated under Section 220 of the Code. This Court also held, even if a non-public servant, though charged only of offences under Section 420 and Section 120B read with Section 420 IPC, he could also be tried by the Special Judge with the aid of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act. We fully endorse that view.

35. We are, however, in Criminal Appeal No.161 of 2011, concerned with a situation where no charge has been framed against the public servant, while he was alive, under Section 3(1) nor any charge was framed against a private person for any offence under Section 3(1) of the PC Act. The Special Judge, therefore, had no occasion to “try any case” under Section 3(1) of the PC Act, either against a public servant or a private person, so as to try any offence other than an offence specified in Section 3, meaning thereby, non-PC offences against private person, like the appellant.

36. The Special Judge appointed under Section 3(1) could exercise the powers under sub-section (3) to Section 4 to try non-PC offence. Therefore, trying a case by a Special Judge under Section 3(1) is a sine-qua-non for exercising jurisdiction by the Special Judge for trying any offence, other than an offence specified in Section 3. “Trying any case” under Section 3(1) is, therefore, a jurisdictional fact for the Special Judge to exercise powers to try any offence other than an offence specified in Section 3.

37. Exclusion of the jurisdiction of ordinary Criminal Court, so far as offences under the PC Act are concerned, has been explicitly expressed under Section 4(1) of the PC Act, which does not find a place in respect of non-PC offences in sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act. Further, it is not obligatory on the part of a Special Judge to try non-PC offences. The expression “may also try” gives an element of discretion on the part of the Special Judge which will depend upon the facts of each case and the inter-relation between PC offences and non-PC offences.

38. A Special Judge exercising powers under the PC Act is not expected to try non-PC offences totally unconnected with any PC offences under Section 3(1) of the PC Act and in the event of a Special Judge not trying any offence under Section 3(1) of the PC Act, the question of the Special Judge trying non-PC offences does not arise. As already indicated, trying of a PC offence is a jurisdictional fact to exercise the powers under Sub-section (3) of Section 4. Jurisdiction of the Special Judge, as such, has not been divested, but the exercise of jurisdiction, depends upon the jurisdictional fact of trying a PC offence. We are, therefore, concerned with the exercise of jurisdiction and not the existence of jurisdiction of the Special Judge.

39. The meaning and content of the expression “jurisdictional fact” has been considered by this Court in Carona Ltd. v. Parvathy Swaminathan & Sons (2007) 8 SCC 559, and noticed that where the jurisdiction of a Court or a Tribunal is dependent on the existence of a particular state of affairs, that state of affairs may be described as preliminary to, or collective to the merits of the issue. Existence of a jurisdictional fact is thus a sine qua non or condition precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by a Court. In Ramesh Chandra Sankla v. Vikram Cement & Ors. (2008) 14 SCC 58, this Court held that by erroneously assuming existence of the jurisdictional fact, a Court cannot confer upon itself jurisdiction which otherwise it does not possess.

40. We have already indicated that the jurisdictional fact so as to try non-PC offences is “trying any case” under the PC Act. As noticed by this Court in Ratilal Bhanji Mithani v. State of Maharashtra (1979) 2 SCC 179, the trial of a warrant case starts with the framing of charge. Prior to that the proceedings are only an inquiry. The Court held as follows:-

“Once a charge is framed, the Magistrate has no power under Section 227 or any other provision of the Code to cancel the charge, and reverse the proceedings to the stage of Section 253 and discharge the accused. The trial in a warrant case starts with the framing of charge; prior to it, the proceedings are only an inquiry. After the framing of the charge if the accused pleads not guilty, the Magistrate is required to proceed with the trial in the manner provided in Sections 254 to 258 to a logical end. Once a charge is framed in a warrant case, instituted either on complaint or a police report, the Magistrate has no power under the Code to discharge the accused, and thereafter, he can either acquit or convict the accused unless he decides to proceed under Section 349 and 562 of the Code of 1898 (which correspond to Sections 325 and 360 of the Code of 1973).”
41. We may now examine whether, in both these appeals, the above test has been satisfied. First, we may deal with Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008. CBI, in this appeal, as already indicated, submitted the charge-sheet on 1.11.2001 for the offences against A-1, who is a public servant, as well as against non-public servants. Learned Special Judge had, on 25.3.2003, framed the charges against the accused persons under Section 120B read Sections with 467, 471 and 420 IPC and also under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the PC Act and substantive offences under Sections 420, 467 and 471 IPC and also substantive offences under Sections 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the PC Act against the public servants. Therefore, charges have been framed against the public servants as well as non-public servants after hearing the prosecution and defence counsel, by the special Judge on 25.3.2003 in respect of PC offences as well as non-PC offences. As already indicated, under sub-section (3) of Section 4, when trying any case, a Special Judge may also try any offence other than the offence specified in Section 3 and be charged in the same trial. The Special Judge, in the instant case, has framed charges against the public servant as well as against the non-public servant for offences punishable under Section 3(1) of PC Act as well as for the offences punishable under Section 120B read with Sections 467, 471 and 420 IPC and, therefore, the existence of jurisdictional fact that is “trying a case” under the PC Act has been satisfied.

42. The Special Judge after framing the charge for PC and non-PC offences posted the case for examination of prosecution witnesses, thereafter the sole public servant died on 2.6.2003. Before that, the Special Judge, in the instant case, has also exercised his powers under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act and hence cannot be divested with the jurisdiction to proceed against the non-public servant, even if the sole public servant dies after framing of the charges. On death, the charge against the public servant alone abates and since the special Judge has already exercised his jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act, that jurisdiction cannot be divested due to the death of the sole public servant.

43. We can visualize a situation where a public servant dies at the fag end of the trial, by that time, several witnesses might have been examined and to hold that the entire trial would be vitiated due to death of a sole public servant would defeat the entire object and purpose of the PC Act, which is enacted for effective combating of corruption and to expedite cases related to corruption and bribery. The purpose of the PC Act is to make anti-corruption laws more effective in order to expedite the proceedings, provisions for day-to-day trial of cases, transparency with regard to grant of stay and exercise of powers of revision on interlocutory orders have also been provided under the PC Act. Consequently, once the power has been exercised by the Special Judge under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the PC Act to proceed against non-PC offences along with PC offences, the mere fact that the sole public servant dies after the exercise of powers under sub-section (3) of Section 4, will not divest the jurisdiction of the Special Judge or vitiate the proceedings pending before him.

44. We are, therefore, inclined to allow Criminal Appeal No. 943 of 2008 and set aside the order of the High Court and direct the Special Judge to complete the trial of the cases within a period of six months.

45. We may now examine Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011, where the FIR was registered on 2.7.1996 and the charge-sheet was filed before the Special Judge on 14.9.2001 for the offences under Sections 120B, 420, IPC read with Sections 13(2) and 13(1) of the PC Act. Accused 9 and 10 died even before the charge-sheet was sent to the Special Judge. The charge against the sole public servant under the PC Act could also not be framed since he died on 18.2.2005. The Special Judge also could not frame any charge against non-public servants. As already indicated, under sub-section (3) of Section 4, the special Judge could try non-PC offences only when “trying any case” relating to PC offences. In the instant case, no PC offence has been committed by any of the non-public servants so as to fall under Section 3(1) of the PC Act. Consequently, there was no occasion for the special Judge to try any case relating to offences under the PC Act against the Appellant. The trying of any case under the PC Act against a public servant or a non-public servant, as already indicated, is a sine-qua-non for exercising powers under sub-section (3) of Section 4 of PC Act. In the instant case, since no PC offence has been committed by any of the non- public servants and no charges have been framed against the public servant, while he was alive, the Special Judge had no occasion to try any case against any of them under the PC Act, since no charge has been framed prior to the death of the public servant. The jurisdictional fact, as already discussed above, does not exist so far as this appeal is concerned, so as to exercise jurisdiction by the Special Judge to deal with non-PC offences.

46. Consequently, we find no error in the view taken by the Special Judge, CBI, Greater Mumbai in forwarding the case papers of Special Case No. 88 of 2001 in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for trying the case in accordance with law. Consequently, the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The competent Court to which the Special Case No. 88 of 2001 is forwarded, is directed to dispose of the same within a period of six months. Criminal Appeal No. 161 of 2011 is allowed accordingly.",1
Basappa,"Appellant is the accused in C.C. No. 707 of 2004 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate First Class at Hubli, Karnataka. He was charge- sheeted under Sections 279 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPC’) and Sections 187 and 196 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as ‘MV Act’). The accident occurred on 11.02.2004 at 02.30 P.M. when the appellant was allegedly driving a tractor with a trailer. The vehicle hit against a scooty and resultantly a two year old child travelling in the scooty fell down. The tractor ran over the child and she succumbed to the injury. PWs 1 to 11 were examined and seven documents were marked on the prosecution side. Two documents were marked on the side of the accused. The learned Magistrate, after elaborately discussing the evidence, came to the following conclusion at paragraph-22 of the Judgment dated 25.05.2005:

“22. Perused the evidence of PW-1 to 11 and the case file after perusal of the same, it creates doubt whether this accused was the driver at the relevant point of time or not, so also to say that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent act of this accused, as there is no any cogent, impeachable and clinching evidence with respect to the ingredients of alleged offences. Further in view of these types of discrepancies of the prosecution witnesses case is not beyond doubt. Had the prosecution able to explain clearly the above said doubtful circumstances, then certainly this court could have believed the evidence of the material witnesses but now the doubtful evidence and circumstances are not cleared. Hence I am not accepting the stand taken by the learned APP. Therefore in view of the so many discrepancies in the versions deposed before the court and one given before the police, it creates doubt whether this accused was involved in the commission of offences or not. Therefore, I feel accused is entitled for acquittal.” (Emphasis supplied)

3. We are informed that the accused was on bail during the trial but remained in custody for five months and five days during investigation.

4. The State filed appeal under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr.PC’). The High Court re-appreciated the whole evidence and came to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to be convicted under Sections 279 and 304A of IPC. Further, it was held that “the prosecution has failed to prove the offences under Section 187 and 197 of the MV Act”. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and the appellant was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months with fine of Rs.2,000/- under Section 304A and for three months with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 279 of IPC. A default sentence was also given. The sentences were to run concurrently. Thus aggrieved, the appellant is before this Court.

5. Section 197 of the MV Act deals with unauthorized driving of a motor vehicle. Section 187 of the MV Act reads as follows: “187. Punishment for offences relating to accident.-Whoever fails to comply with the provisions of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 132 or of section 133 or section 134 shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both or, if having been previously convicted of an offence under this section, he is again convicted of an offence under this section, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.” Section 132(1)(c) of the MV Act was omitted w.e.f. 14.11.1994. Section 133 deals with duty of the driver, owner or conductor to furnish information on demand. There is no such case for the prosecution. Therefore, the alleged offence could only be non-compliance of Section 134, which reads as under:

“134. Duty of driver in case of accident and injury to a person.- When any person is injured or any property of a 3rd party is damaged, as a result of an accident in which a motor vehicle is involved, the driver of the vehicle or other person-in-charge of the vehicle shall-
(a) unless it is not practicable to do so on account of mob fury or any other reason beyond his control, take all reasonable steps to secure medical attention for the injured person by conveying him to the nearest medical practitioner or hospital, and it shall be the duty of every registered medical practitioner or the doctor on duty in the hospital immediately to attend to the injured person and render medical aid or treatment without waiting for any procedural formalities, unless the injured person or his guardian, in case he is a minor, desires otherwise;
(b) give on demand by a police officer any information required by him, or, if no police officer is present, report the circumstances of the occurrence, including the circumstances, if any, for not taking reasonable steps to secure the medical attention as required under clause (a), at the nearest police station as soon as possible and in any case within twenty-four hours of the occurrence.
(c) give the following information in writing to the insurer, who has issued the certificates of insurance, about the occurrence of the accident, namely:-
(i) insurance policy number and period of its validity;
(ii) date, time and place of accident;
(iii) particulars of the persons injured or killed in the accident;
(iv) name of the driver and the particulars of his driving licence.
Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, the expression “driver” includes the owner of the vehicle.” (Emphasis supplied)
6. In the instant case, the main defence of the appellant before the trial court was that there was no evidence to hold that he was the driver of the tractor at the relevant time. According to the prosecution, there is no direct evidence. Even the injured witness PW- 5, who was driving the scooty, has not identified the driver. The High Court, on the only evidence that the appellant was scolded by people in the hospital, has come to the conclusion that the appellant was the driver of the tractor. There is also no direct evidence with regard to the ingredients of Sections 279 and 304A of IPC. The High Court, on re- appreciation of the evidence, has taken another view so as to convict the accused.
7. There is no finding in the impugned Judgment by the High Court that the conclusions drawn by the trial court are perverse so as to mean that the same is against the weight of evidence. The important issue, thus, for our consideration is - whether the High Court was justified in re-appreciating the evidence and reversing the order of acquittal merely because of a possibility of another view.

8. The High Court in an appeal under Section 378 of Cr.PC is entitled to reappraise the evidence and conclusions drawn by the trial court, but the same is permissible only if the judgment of the trial court is perverse, as held by this Court in Gamini Bala Koteswara Rao and Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh through Secretary[1]. To quote: “14. We have considered the arguments advanced and heard the matter at great length. It is true, as contended by Mr Rao, that interference in an appeal against an acquittal recorded by the trial court should be rare and in exceptional circumstances. It is, however, well settled by now that it is open to the High Court to reappraise the evidence and conclusions drawn by the trial court but only in a case when the judgment of the trial court is stated to be perverse. The word “perverse” in terms as understood in law has been defined to mean “against the weight of evidence”. We have to see accordingly as to whether the judgment of the trial court which has been found perverse by the High Court was in fact so.” (Emphasis supplied)

9. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the judgment of the trial court is based on no material or that it suffered from any legal infirmity in the sense that there was non-consideration or misappreciation of the evidence on record. Only in such circumstances, reversal of the acquittal by the High Court would be justified. In K. Prakashan v. P.K. Surenderan[2], it has also been affirmed by this Court that the appellate court should not reverse the acquittal merely because another view is possible on the evidence. In T. Subramanian v. State of Tamil Nadu[3], it has further been held by this Court that if two views are reasonably possible on the very same evidence, it cannot be said that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

10. In Bhim Singh v. State of Haryana[4], it has been clarified that interference by the appellate court against an order of acquittal would be justified only if the view taken by the trial court is one which no reasonable person would in the given circumstances, take.

11. In Kallu alias Masih and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh[5], it has been held by this Court that if the view taken by the trial court is a plausible view, the High Court will not be justified in reversing it merely because a different view is possible. To quote: “8. While deciding an appeal against acquittal, the power of the appellate court is no less than the power exercised while hearing appeals against conviction. In both types of appeals, the power exists to review the entire evidence. However, one significant difference is that an order of acquittal will not be interfered with, by an appellate court, where the judgment of the trial court is based on evidence and the view taken is reasonable and plausible. It will not reverse the decision of the trial court merely because a different view is possible. The appellate court will also bear in mind that there is a presumption of innocence in favour of the accused and the accused is entitled to get the benefit of any doubt. Further, if it decides to interfere, it should assign reasons for differing with the decision of the trial court.” (Emphasis supplied)

12. In Ramesh Babulal Doshi v. State of Gujarat[6], this Court has taken the view that while considering the appeal against acquittal, the appellate court is first required to seek an answer to the question whether the findings of the trial court are palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable and if the court answers the above question in negative, the acquittal cannot be disturbed. To quote:

“7. … the entire approach of the trial court in dealing with the evidence was patently illegal or the conclusions arrived at by it were wholly untenable. While sitting in judgment over an acquittal the appellate court is first required to seek an answer to the question whether the findings of the trial court are palpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable. If the appellate court answers the above question in the negative the order of acquittal is not to be disturbed. Conversely, if the appellate court holds, for reasons to be recorded, that the order of acquittal cannot at all be sustained in view of any of the above infirmities it can then — and then only — reappraise the evidence to arrive at its own conclusions. …” (Emphasis supplied)

13. In Ganpat v. State of Haryana and others[7], at paragraph-15, some of the above principles have been restated. To quote: “15. The following principles have to be kept in mind by the appellate court while dealing with appeals, particularly, against an order of acquittal:

(i) There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded and to come to its own conclusion.

(ii) The appellate court can also review the trial court’s conclusion with respect to both facts and law.

(iii) While dealing with the appeal preferred by the State, it is the duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire evidence on record and by giving cogent and adequate reasons may set aside the judgment of acquittal.

(iv) An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there are “compelling and substantial reasons” for doing so. If the order is “clearly unreasonable”, it is a compelling reason for interference.

(v) When the trial court has ignored the evidence or misread the material evidence or has ignored material documents like dying declaration/report of ballistic experts, etc. the appellate court is competent to reverse the decision of the trial court depending on the materials placed. …”

14. The exercise of power under Section 378 of Cr.PC by the court is to prevent failure of justice or miscarriage of justice. There is miscarriage of justice if an innocent person is convicted; but there is failure of justice if the guilty is let scot-free. As cautioned by this Court in State of Punjab v. Karnail Singh[8]:

“6. There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based. Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court to reappreciate the evidence even where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of the accused committed any offence or not. …” (Emphasis supplied)

15. In this context, yet another caution struck by this Court in Chandrappa and others v. State of Karnataka[9] would also be relevant.

“42. From the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge: (1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. (2) The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.

(3) Various expressions, such as, “substantial and compelling reasons”, “good and sufficient grounds”, “very strong circumstances”, “distorted conclusions”, “glaring mistakes”, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of “flourishes of language” to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court. (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.” (Emphasis supplied)

16. The High Court in the impugned Judgment does not seem to have taken a view that the judgment of the trial court acquitting the accused is based on no material or it is perverse or the view by the trial court is wholly unreasonable or it is not a plausible view or there is non- consideration of any evidence or there is palpable misreading of evidence, etc. It is not the stand of the High Court that there had been some miscarriage of justice in the way the trial court has appreciated the evidence. On the contrary, it is the only stand of the High Court that on the available evidence, another view is also reasonably possible in the sense that the appellant-accused could have been convicted. In such circumstances, the High Court was not justified in reversing the acquittal. The High Court itself having acquitted the appellant under Section 187 of the MV Act on the ground of no evidence, whether it was possible, to hold him guilty under Sections 279 and 304A of IPC, is itself a seriously doubtful question. However, it is not necessary to pronounce on that issue since the appellant is liable to succeed otherwise.

17. The appeal is allowed. The impugned Judgment is set aside and that of the trial court is restored.",1
Union of India Through Director of Income Tax,"The issue that arise for our consideration and decision in this batch of appeals is, whether the revenue is legally responsible under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short, “the Act”) for payment of interest on the refund of tax made to the resident/deductor under Section 240 of the Act.

3. At the outset, it is relevant to notice that the assessment years in all these appeals are on and after 01.04.1989, that is after the admittance of Section 244A of the Act by Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987 (4 of 1988) with effect from 01.04.1989, whereby provision for interest on refunds on any amount due to the assessee under the Act was introduced.

FACTS:-

4. We would refer to the facts in Civil Appeal No. 6301 of 2011. The respondent is a company incorporated under the provisions of Companies Act, 1956. It is engaged in the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizer. During the assessment year 1997-98, the respondent-company had commissioned its naptha desulphurization plant and to oversee the operation of the said plant it had sought the assistance of two technicians from M/s. Haldor Topsoe, Denmark. M/s. Haldor Topsoe had raised an invoice aggregating to US$ 43,290,06/- as service charges for services of the technicians (US$ 38,500/-) and reimbursements of expenses (US$ 4,790/-).

5. The resident/deductor had approached the Income Tax Officer under Section 195 (2) of the Act inter alia requesting him to provide information/ determination as to what percentage of tax should be withheld from the amounts payable to the foreign company, namely, M/s. Haldor Topsoe, Denmark. On the request so made, the Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer had determined and passed Special order under Section 195 (2) of the Act directing the resident/ deductor to deduct/ withhold tax at the rate of 20% before remitting aforesaid amounts to M/s.Haldor Topsoe. Accordingly, the resident/ deductor had deducted tax of Rs.1,98,878/- on the entire amount of US$ 43,290.00/- and credited the same in favour of the Revenue.

6. After such deposit, the resident/ deductor had preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) against the aforesaid order passed by the Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer under Section 195 (2) of the Act. The appellate authority while allowing the appeal so filed by the resident/ deductor, had concluded, that, the reimbursement of expenses is not a part of the income for deduction of tax at source under Section 195 of the Act and accordingly, directed the refund of the tax that was deducted and paid over to the Revenue on the amount of US$ 4790.06/- representing reimbursement of expenses by order dated 12.07.2002.

7. After disposal of the appeal, the resident/ deductor had claimed the refund of tax on US$ 4790/- (amounting to Rs.22,005/-) with the interest thereon as provided under Section 244A(1) of the Act by its letter dated 09.12.2002.

8. The Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer while declining the claim made, has observed, that, Section 244A provides for interest only on refunds due to the assessee under the Act and not to the deductor and since the refund in the instant case is in view of the circulars viz. Circular No. 769 and 790 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (for short “the Board”) and not under the statutory provisions of the Act, no interest would accrue on the refunds under Section 244A of the Act. Therefore, the Assessing Officer/Income Tax Officer while granting refund of the tax paid on the aforesaid amount has refused to entertain the claim for interest on the amount so refunded by order dated 29.07.2003.

9. Since the Assessing Officer/Income Tax Officer had declined to grant the interest on the amount so refunded, the resident/ deductor had carried the matter by way of an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The First Appellate Authority by its order dated 28.03.2005 has approved the orders passed by the Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer and declined the claim of the deductor/resident on two counts : (a) that the refund in the instant case would fall under two circulars viz. Circular No. 769 and 790 issued by the Board which specifically provide that the benefit of interest under Section 244A of the Act on such refunds would not be available to the deductor/ resident and (b) that a conjoint reading of Section 156 and the explanation appended to Section 244A (1)(b) of the Act would indicate that the amount refunded to the deductor/resident cannot be equated to the refund of the amount(s) envisaged under Section 244A(1)(b) of the Act, wherein only the interest on refund of excess payment made under Section 156 of the Act pursuant to a notice of demand issued on account of post-assessment tax is contemplated and not the interest on refund of tax deposited under self-assessment as in the instant case.

10. The deductor/resident, aggrieved by the aforesaid order, had carried the matter before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short, “the Tribunal”). The Tribunal while reversing the judgment and order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has opined, that, the tax was paid by the deductor/ resident pursuant to an order passed under Section 195 (2) of the Act and the refund was ordered under Section 240 of the Act, therefore, the provisions of Section 244A(1)(b) are clearly attracted and the revenue is accountable for payment of interest on the aforesaid refund amount. Accordingly, the Tribunal has allowed the appeal of the deductor/ resident and directed the Assessing Officer/ Income Tax Officer to acknowledge the claim and allow the interest as provided under Section 244A(1)(b) of the Act on the aforesaid amount of refund, by order dated 28.06.2008.

11. The Revenue being of the view that they are treated unfairly by the Tribunal had carried the matter by way of Income Tax Appeal before the High Court. The High Court has refused to accept the appeal filed by the Revenue by the impugned judgment and order, dated 18.06.2009. That is how the Revenue is before us in these appeals.

12. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the Revenue and the respondent-assessee in these appeals and also carefully perused the orders passed by the forums below.

RELEVANT PROVISIONS:-

13. To appreciate the view point of the learned counsel for the Revenue, we require to notice certain provisions of the Act prior to the insertion of Section 244A of the Act. The sections that require to be noticed are; Sections 156, 195(2), 240 and 244 of the Act. A perusal of these sections essentially would indicate the procedure whereby the tax amount is paid and the refund of excess amount is claimed by the assessee. The relevant part of the said sections is sequentially reproduced:

“Section 156. Notice of demand When any tax, interest, penalty, fine or any other sum is payable in consequence of any order passed under this Act, the Assessing Officer shall serve upon the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable.
       ***             ***                ***
Section 195. Other sums-


(1) Any person responsible for paying to a non-resident, not being a company, or to a foreign company, any interest or any other sum chargeable under the provisions of this Act (not being income chargeable under the head ‘Salaries’) shall, at the time of credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct income-
tax thereon at the rates in force:

Provided that in the case of interest payable by the Government or a public section bank within the meaning of clause (23D) of Section 10 or a public financial institution within the meaning of that clause, deduction of tax shall be made only at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of chaque or draft or by any other mode:
Provided further that no such deduction shall be made in respect of any dividends referred to in Section 115-O.
Explanation.- For the purpose of this section, where any interest or other sum as aforesaid is credited to any account, whether called ‘Interest payable account’ or ‘Suspense account’ or by any other name, in the books of account of the person liable to pay such income, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such income to the account of the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.
(2) Where the person responsible for paying any such sum chargeable under this Act other than salary to a non-resident considers that the whole of such sum would not be income chargeable in the case of the recipient, he may make an application to the Assessing Officer to determine, by general or special order, the appropriate proportion of such sum so chargeable, and upon such determination, tax shall be deducted under sub-section (1) only on that proportion of the sum which is so chargeable.
*** *** *** Section 240. Refund on appeal, etc. Where, as a result of any order passed in appeal or other proceeding under this Act, refund of any amount becomes due to the assessee, the Assessing Officer shall, except as otherwise provided in this Act, refund the amount to the assessee without his having to make any claim in that behalf.
*** *** *** Section 244. Interest on refund where no claim is needed (1) Where a refund is due to the assessee in pursuance of an order referred to in section 240 and the Assessing Officer does not grant the refund within a period of three months from the end of the month in which such order is passed the Central Government shall pay to the assessee simple interest at fifteen per cent per annum on the amount of refund due from the date immediately following the expiry of the period of three months aforesaid to the date on which the refund is granted.
(1A) Where the whole or any part of the refund referred to in sub- section (1) is due to the assessee, as a result of any amount having been paid by him after the 31st day of March, 1975, in pursuance of any order of assessment or penalty and such amount or any part thereof having been found in appeal or other proceeding under this Act to be in excess of the amount which such assessee is liable to pay as tax or penalty, as the case may be, under this Act, the Central Government shall pay to such assessee simple interest at the rate specified in sub-section (1) on the amount so found to be in excess from the date on which such amount was paid to the date on which the refund is granted:
Provided that where the amount so found to be in excess was paid in instalments, such interest shall be payable on the amount of each such instalment or any part of such instalment, which was in excess, from the date on which such instalment was paid to the date on which the refund is granted:
Provided further that no interest under this sub-section shall be payable for a period of one month from the date of the passing of the order in appeal or other proceeding:
Provided also that where any interest is payable to an assessee under this subsection, no interest under sub-section (1) shall be payable to him in respect of the amount so found to be in excess.
(2) * * * (3) The provisions of this section shall not apply in respect of any assessment for the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1989, or any subsequent assessment years.
14. Section 156 of the Act talks about payment of tax, interest, penalty, fine or any other sum payable in consequence of any order passed under the Act on service of notice of demand issued by the assessing officer to the assessee specifying the said amounts.

15. Section 195(1) casts an obligation upon every person in this Country to deduct tax at the prevailing rates from out of any sum which is remitted to a non resident/Foreign Company. Sub Section (2) of Section 195 provides that where a person responsible for paying any such sum chargeable under the Act to a non resident/Foreign Company considers that the whole of such sum would not be the income chargeable in the case of recipient, he may make an application to the assessing officer/income tax officer to determine, by general or special order, the appropriate proportion of such sum so chargeable. The assessing officer is expected to determine such sum/tax which are deductible out of remittance to be sent to the recipient and only after deduction and payment of such sum/tax, the balance amount is to be remitted to the non-resident. We clarify here that it is the statutory obligation of the person responsible for paying such sum to deduct tax thereon before making payment, if such application is not filed.

16. Section 240 of the Act provides for refund on appeal etc. The Section envisages that if an amount becomes due to the assessee by virtue of an order passed in appeal, reference, revision, rectification or amendment proceedings, the assessing officer is bound to refund the amount to the assessee without the assessee being required to make any claim in that behalf. The expression ‘other proceedings under the Act’ used in Section 240 of the Act, are wide enough to include any order passed in proceedings other than the appeals under the Act.

17. Section 244 of the Act provides for interest on refunds where no claim is made or required to be made by the assessee. The said section envisages that where a refund is due to the assessee in pursuance of an order passed under Section 240 of the Act, and the assessing officer does not grant the refund within a period of three months from the end of the month in which such order is passed, the Central Government shall pay to the assessee a simple interest of 15% per annum on the amount of refund due from the date immediately following the expiry of the period of three months as aforesaid to the date on which the refund is granted.

18. Since there was disconcert in the minds of both the assessee and the Revenue regarding the cases where payment of interest was required to be made to the assessee by the Revenue, the Parliament has thought it fit to insert a new Section 244A in the place of Sections 214, 243 and 244 in respect of assessments for the assessment year 1989-90 and onwards. The Section is extracted:

“244A. Interest on refunds.
(1)Where refund of any amount becomes due to the assessee under this Act, he shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be entitled to receive, in addition to the said amount, simple interest thereon calculated in the following manner, namely:-
(a) Where the refund is out of any tax paid under section 115WJ or collected at source under section 206C or paid by way of advance tax or treated as paid under section 199, during the financial year immediately preceding the assessment year, such interest shall be calculated at the rate of one-half per cent for every month or part of a month comprised in the period from the 1st day of April of the assessment year to the date on which the refund is granted.
Provided that no interest shall be payable if the amount of refund is less than ten per cent of the tax as determined under sub-section (1) of section 115WE or sub-section (1) of section 143 or on regular assessment;
(b) in any other case, such interest shall be calculated at the rate of one-half per cent for every month or part of a month comprised in the period or periods from the date or, as the case may be, dates of payment of tax or penalty to the date on which the refund is granted.
EXPLANATION.- For the purpose of this clause, ""date of payment of tax or penalty"" means the date on and from which the amount of tax or penalty specified in the notice of demand issued under section 156 is paid in excess of such demand.
(2) * * * (3) * * * (4) The provisions of this section shall apply in respect of assessments for the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1989, and subsequent assessment year” (emphasis supplied)
19. The objects and reasons for introduction of the aforesaid Section is clarified by the Board in its Circular No. 549, dated 31.10.1989. Relevant paragraphs of which are as under:

“11.2 Insertion of a new section 244A in lieu of sections 214, 243 and 244,- Under the provisions of section 214, interest was payable to the assessess on any excess advance tax paid by him in a financial year from the 1st day of April next following the said financial year to the date of regular assessment. In case the refund was not granted within three months from the date of the month in which the regular assessment was completed, section 243 provided for further payment of interest. Under section 244, interest was payable to the assessee for delay in payment of refund as a result of an order passed in appeal, etc., from the date following after the expiry of three months from the end of the month in which such order was passed to the date on which refund was granted. The rate of interest under all the three sections was 15 per cent annum.
11.3. These provisions, apart from being complicated left certain gaps for which interest was not paid by the Department to the assessee for money remaining with the Government. To remove this inequity, as also to simplify the provisions in this regard, the Amending Act, 1987, has inserted a new Section 244A in the Income Tax Act, applicable from the assessment year 1989-90 and onwards which contains all the provisions for payment of interest by the Department for delay in the grant of refunds. The rate of interest has been increased from the earlier 15 per cent annum to 1.5% per month or part of a month, comprised in the period of delay in the grant of refund. The Amending Act, 1987, has also amended sections 214, 243 and 244 to provide that the provisions of these sections shall not apply to the assessment year 1989-90 or any subsequent assessment years.” (emphasis supplied) SUBMISSIONS:-

20. Shri Arijit Prasad, learned counsel appearing for the Revenue would submit, that, if the tax is paid under Section 195(2) of the Act, then while refunding the amounts so paid, the Revenue need not be burdened with payment of interest on the amount so refunded. He would submit that while Section 244A(1)(a) specifically provides for the four instances under specific provisions where the interest would be payable on the refund of tax paid, Section 244A(1)(b) does not provide for any specific instance but mentions “any other cases” and the explanation appended to the said Section requires payment of refund to be made in cases where notice of demand was issued under Section 156 of the Act and since no demand notice was issued to the assessee under Section 156 of the Act the assessee would not be covered even by the aforesaid provision and hence, no interest is payable to the assessee by the Revenue. It is further submitted that interest under Section 244A is to be granted in case where refund of any amount becomes due to an assessee under this Act and the refund of tax deducted at source made to the deductor/resident is not under any statutory provisions of the Act, the deductor/ resident is not entitled for interest on the amount of tax deducted and deposited with the revenue.

21. Per contra, learned senior counsel appearing for the resident/deductor would submit that since the payment made under Section 195(2) is payment made under the Act pursuant to an order passed by the assessing officer which in turn would be sheltered under the provisions of Section 156 of the Act, by virtue of clause(b) of sub-Section(1) of Section 244A of the Act, the Revenue is obliged to refund the tax with interest.

DISCUSSION:-

22. It is cardinal principle of interpretation of Statutes that the words of a Statute must be understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and construed according to their grammatical meaning unless such construction leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context or in the object of the Statute to the contrary. The golden rule is that the words of a Statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet another rule of construction that when the words of a Statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the Courts are bound to give effect to that meaning irrespective of the consequences. It is said that the words themselves best declare the intention of the law giver. The Courts have adhered to the principle that efforts should be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the legislature and it is not a sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a Statute as being inapposite surpluses, if they can have proper application in circumstances conceivable within the contemplation of the Statute (See Gurudevdatta VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra [2001] 4 SCC 534).

23. It is also well settled principle that the courts must interpret the provisions of the Statute upon ascertaining the object of the legislation through the medium or authoritative forms in which it is expressed. It is well settled that the Court should, while interpreting the provisions of the Statute, assign its ordinary meaning.

24. This Court in Shyam Sunder vs. Ram Kumar (2001) 8 SCC 24 has observed that in relation to beneficent construction, the basic rules of interpretation are not to be applied where (i) the result would be re- legislation of a provision by addition, substitution or alteration of words and violence would be done to the spirit of legislation, (ii) where the words of a Provision are capable of being given only one meaning and (iii) where there is no ambiguity in a provision, however, the Court may apply the rule of beneficent construction in order to advance the object of the Act.

25. Before the insertion of Section 244A as a composite Section by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, the liability to pay interest on refund of pre-paid taxes was contained in Sections 214, 243 read with Section 244 (1A) of the Act. The Parliament has introduced a new Section in the place of Sections 214, 243 and 244 in respect of assessment for the assessment year 1989-90 and onwards.

26. The language of the Section is precise, clear and unambiguous. Sub-Section (1) of Section 244A speaks of interest on refund of the amounts due to an assessee under the Act. The assessee is entitled for the said amount of refund with interest thereon as calculated in accordance with clause (a) & (b) of sub-Section (1) of Section 244A. In calculating the interest payable, the section provides for different dates from which the interest is to be calculated.

27. Clause(a) of sub-Section(1) of Section 244A talks of payment of interest on the amount of tax paid under Section 155WJ, tax collected at source under section 206C, taxes paid by way of advance tax, taxes treated as paid under Section 199 during the financial year immediately preceding the assessment year. Under this clause, the interest shall be payable for the period starting from the first day of the assessment year to the date of the grant of refund. No interest is payable if the excess payment is less than 10% of the tax determined under Section 143(1) of the Act or on regular assessment. Clause(b) of Sub-Section(1) of Section 244A opens with the words ""in any other case"" that means in any case other than the amounts paid under Clause(a) of Sub-section(1) of Section 244A. Under this clause, the rate of interest is to be calculated at the rate of one and a half per cent per month or a part of a month comprised in the period or the periods from the date or, as the case may be, either the dates of payment of the tax or the penalty to the date on which the refund is granted. An explanation is appended to clause(b) of the aforesaid sub-Section to explain the meaning of the expression ""date of payment of tax or penalty"". It clarifies that the “date of payment of tax or penalty” would mean the date on and from which the amount of tax or penalty specified in the notice of demand issued under section 156 is paid in excess of such demand.

28. Having glanced through the relevant sections and the settled legal principles of interpretation of Statute, let us revert back to the factual situation placed before us in this appeal.

29. In the present case, the resident/ deductor had approached the assessing authority inter alia requesting him to determine the tax that requires to be deducted at source before the payment is made to a non- resident/foreign company. On such a request the assessing officer had passed an order under Section 195(2) of the Act directing the resident/ deductor to deduct tax at a particular rate. The resident/ deductor had appealed against the said order, but had deposited the tax as directed by the assessing officer/Income Tax Officer by the aforesaid order in accordance with the provisions of Section 200 of the Act. When the resident/deductor succeeded in the appeal, a direction was issued by the appellate authority for refund of tax so paid. In observance of the same, the assessing authority had granted the refund of the tax amount under Section 240 of the Act, but declined to grant interest on the said refund amount. The conclusion arrived at by the assessing officer was accepted by the first appellate authority on the ground, inter alia, that the conjoint reading of Section 156 and the explanation appended to Section 244A(1)(b) of the Act would indicate that the amount refunded to the resident/ deductor cannot be equated to the refund contemplated under Section 244A(1)(b) of the Act, whereunder only the interest on refund of excess payment made under Section 156 of the Act on account of post-assessment tax is contemplated and not the interest on refund of tax deposited under self- assessment. However, the Tribunal has rejected the aforesaid rationale of the assessing authority as well as the first appellate authority and granted the claim of the resident/deductor. The High Court has endorsed the view of the Tribunal and dismissed the appeals filed the Revenue.

30. The refund becomes due when tax deducted at source, advance tax paid, self assessment tax paid and tax paid on regular assessment exceeds tax chargeable for the year as a result of an order passed in appeal or other proceedings under the Act. When refund is of any advance tax (including tax deducted/collected at source), interest is payable for the period starting from the first day of the assessment year to the date of grant of refund. No interest is, however, payable if the excess payment is less than 10 percent of tax determined under Section 143(1) or on regular assessment. No interest is payable for the period for which the proceedings resulting in the refund are delayed for the reasons attributable to the assessee (wholly or partly). The rate of interest and entitlement to interest on excess tax are determined by the statutory provisions of the Act. Interest payment is a statutory obligation and non- discretionary in nature to the assessee. In tune with the aforesaid general principle, Section 244A is drafted and enacted. The language employed in Section 244A of the Act is clear and plain. It grants substantive right of interest and is not procedural. The principles for grant of interest are the same as under the provisions of Section 244 applicable to assessments before 01.04.1989, albeit with clarity of application as contained in Section 244A.

31. The Department has also issued Circular clarifying the purpose and object of introducing Section 244A of the Act to replace Sections 214, 243 and 244 of the Act. It is clarified therein, that, since there was some lacunae in the earlier provisions with regard to non-payment of interest by the revenue to the assessee for the money remaining with the Government, the said section is introduced for payment of interest by the Department for delay in grant of refunds. A general right exists in the State to refund any tax collected for its purpose, and a corresponding right exists to refund to individuals any sum paid by them as taxes which are found to have been wrongfully exacted or are believed to be, for any reason, inequitable. The statutory obligation to refund carried with it the right to interest also. This is true in the case of assessee under the Act.

32. The question before us is, whether the resident/deductor is also entitled to interest on refund of excess deduction or erroneous deduction of tax at source under Section 195 of the Act.

33. We would begin our discussion by referring to circular No. 790, dated 20.04.2000, issued by the Board. Omitting what is not necessary, the material portion of the circular is extracted:

“........
6. Refund to the person making payment under Section 195 is being allowed as income does not accrue to the non-resident. The amount paid into the Government account in such cases, is no longer ‘tax’. In view of this, no interest under section 244A is admissible on refunds to be granted in accordance with this Circular or on the refunds already granted in accordance with Circular No. 769.”
34. What the deductor/ resident primarily contend is that, what has been deposited by him is a tax, may be for and on behalf of non-resident/ foreign company and when the beneficial circular provides for refund of tax to the deductor under certain circumstances, the refund of tax should carry interest.

35. The circular issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (“the Board” for short) is binding on the department. Binding nature of the circular is explained by this Court in the case of UCO Bank v. CIT 237 ITR 889, wherein this Court has observed that the circulars issued by the Board in exercise of its powers under Section 119 of the Act would be binding on the income tax authorities even if they deviate from the provisions of the Act, so long as they seek to mitigate the rigour of a particular Section for the benefit of the assessee. Therefore, we cannot be taking exception to the reasoning and conclusion reached by the authorities under the Act. However, the Tribunal and the High Court, have granted interest on the amount of tax deposited by the resident/ deductor from the date of payment on the ground, firstly, the refund of tax is directed by the first appellate authority in the appeal filed by the deductor/ resident under Section 240 of the Act and secondly, the Revenue for having retained the sum by way of tax has to compensate the person who had deposited the tax.

36. Section 240 of the Act provides for refund of any amount that becomes due to an assessee as a result of an order in appeal or any other proceedings under the Act. The phrase “other proceedings under the Act” is of wide amplitude. This Court has observed, that, the other proceedings under the Act would include orders passed under Section 154 (rectification proceedings), orders passed by the High Court or Supreme Court under Section 260 (in reference), or order passed by the Commissioner in revision applications under Section 263 or in an application under Section 273A.

37. A “tax refund” is a refund of taxes when the tax liability is less than the tax paid. As per the old section an assessee was entitled for payment of interest on the amount of taxes refunded pursuant to an order passed under the Act, including the order passed in an appeal. In the present fact scenario, the deductor/assessee had paid taxes pursuant to a special order passed by the assessing officer/Income Tax Officer. In the appeal filed against the said order the assessee has succeeded and a direction is issued by the appellate authority to refund the tax paid. The amount paid by the resident/ deductor was retained by the Government till a direction was issued by the appellate authority to refund the same. When the said amount is refunded it should carry interest in the matter of course. As held by the Courts while awarding interest, it is a kind of compensation of use and retention of the money collected unauthorizedly by the Department. When the collection is illegal, there is corresponding obligation on the revenue to refund such amount with interest in as much as they have retained and enjoyed the money deposited. Even the Department has understood the object behind insertion of Section 244A, as that, an assessee is entitled to payment of interest for money remaining with the Government which would be refunded. There is no reason to restrict the same to an assessee only without extending the similar benefit to a resident/ deductor who has deducted tax at source and deposited the same before remitting the amount payable to a non-resident/ foreign company.

38. Providing for payment of interest in case of refund of amounts paid as tax or deemed tax or advance tax is a method now statutorily adopted by fiscal legislation to ensure that the aforesaid amount of tax which has been duly paid in prescribed time and provisions in that behalf form part of the recovery machinery provided in a taxing Statute. Refund due and payable to the assessee is debt-owed and payable by the Revenue. The Government, therebeing no express statutory provision for payment of interest on the refund of excess amount/tax collected by the Revenue, cannot shrug off its apparent obligation to reimburse the deductors lawful monies with the accrued interest for the period of undue retention of such monies. The State having received the money without right, and having retained and used it, is bound to make the party good, just as an individual would be under like circumstances. The obligation to refund money received and retained without right implies and carries with it the right to interest. Whenever money has been received by a party which ex ae quo et bono ought to be refunded, the right to interest follows, as a matter of course.

39. In the present case, it is not in doubt that the payment of tax made by resident/ depositor is in excess and the department chooses to refund the excess payment of tax to the depositor. We have held the interest requires to be paid on such refunds. The catechize is from what date interest is payable, since the present case does not fall either under clause (a) or (b) of Section 244A of the Act. In the absence of an express provision as contained in clause (a), it cannot be said that the interest is payable from the 1st of April of the assessment year. Simultaneously, since the said payment is not made pursuant to a notice issued under Section 156 of the Act, Explanation to clause (b) has no application. In such cases, as the opening words of clause (b) specifically referred to “as in any other case”, the interest is payable from the date of payment of tax. The sequel of our discussion is the resident/deductor is entitled not only the refund of tax deposited under Section 195(2) of the Act, but has to be refunded with interest from the date of payment of such tax.

40. In the result, the appeals fail. Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.",0
Rajkumar,"These appeals have been preferred against the impugned judgment and order dated 27.6.2013 passed in Criminal Reference No. 01 of 2013 and Criminal Appeal No. 397 of 2013 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur affirming the conviction of the appellant under Sections 376 and 450 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the `IPC’) as well as confirming the death sentence awarded for the offence under Section 302 IPC by the trial court vide judgment and order dated 5.2.2013 passed in Sessions Trial No. 20 of 2013.

2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals as per the prosecution are that:

A. On 26.12.2012, the appellant, aged 32 years, came to the house of his neighbour Iknis Jojo (PW.1) and stayed with his four children as Iknis Jojo (PW.1) and his wife Albisiya had gone to irrigate agricultural fields in the night. The appellant was on visiting terms with the family and the children used to call him “Mama” i.e. maternal uncle. On the said night, he had taken liquor and meals in the complainant’s house and when retiring for the night, the appellant asked the prosecutrix Gounjhi, aged 14 years not to sleep with her three siblings i.e. Sushma, Sanchit and Aric, rather to sleep at some distance from them. Around midnight, he raped prosecutrix Gounjhi. While committing rape, he caused some grievous injuries and consequently she died. The incident was witnessed by Sanchit (PW.2), brother of the prosecutrix, however, out of fear, he could not raise any hue and cry. After committing the crime, the appellant left the place of occurrence. In the morning, Iknis Jojo (PW.1) alongwith his wife Albisiya came from their fields and found the children sleeping. They woke them up and also tried to wake the prosecutrix when they realised that she was dead. Sanchit (PW.2) narrated the incident that had occurred in the night.

B. Iknis Jojo (PW.1) immediately went to the police station and lodged the complaint, on the basis of which Crime No. 294 of 2012 was registered for the offence under Sections 302 and 450 IPC. Shri K.S. Thakur, Inspector of Police, Police Station: Nainpur, District Mandla, Madhya Pradesh started the investigation. He came to the spot, recovered the dead body, prepared the Panchnama, also recovered the blackish brown colour purse and clothes lying near the place of occurrence. Some coins and a small packet of tobacoo were also recovered. Some hair were found lying near the dead body of the prosecutrix and one sky blue coloured shawl was also recovered from the place of occurrence which had blood stains and some other kind of stains at various places. The earth of that place having some fluid material thereon was also recovered. The investigating officer prepared the site plan in presence of the witnesses and dead body of the prosecutrix was sent for postmortem and the appellant was arrested.

C. Dr. Surendra Barkare (PW.6) alongwith lady Dr. (Smt.) Prahba Pipre (PW.7) conducted the postmortem of the prosecutrix and submitted the report. As per the postmortem report, rape had been committed upon the deceased and, thus, Sections 376 and 511 IPC were also added in the case.

D. After taking permission from the Judicial Magistrate, the specimen blood of the appellant was obtained to conduct his DNA finger printing which was sent for analysis to State Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar. All the materials sent for chemical analysis were analysed and the report was submitted and on the basis of which the chargesheet was filed and the appellant was put to trial. Appellant denied his involvement in the offence, thus trial commenced. E. Dr. Surendra Barkare (PW.6) deposed and proved the postmortem report and deposed that the prosecutrix died of asphyxia as a result of strangulation and her death was homicidal in nature. F. Iknis Jojo (PW.1), father of the deceased, deposed while giving the version as mentioned in the FIR and admitted that the appellant used to come to his house occasionally and he was referred to by his children as “Mama” and sometimes he used to stay in the house though his house was only half a kilometer away from his house and he was already married having a child.

G. Sanchit (PW.2), a 10 years old boy, supported the case of the prosecution and deposed that his “Mama” had come to their house. He consumed liquor and was served rice and water by the deceased. Appellant asked the prosecutrix to sleep at some distance from her siblings. The appellant slept with other three children and it was about 11-12 in the night that he heard the shrieks of his sister and saw that the appellant had pressed her neck and he got so much scared that he could not even raise the voice. All this was disclosed by PW.2 to his parents in the morning on their returning from the fields.

H. Dr. (Smt.) Prabha Pipre (PW.7) deposed about the conduct of the postmortem of the body of the deceased alongwith Dr. Surendra Barkare (PW.6). They further deposed that hymen of the deceased was torn and blood was oozing out from her private parts. Some blood was present in the cavity of the private part and some blood was also present in the cavity of her uterus. Her vagina accommodated one finger and it accommodated two fingers with difficulty. On the basis of the above, she had opined that deceased had been subjected to rape before murder.

I. The deceased was 14 years of age and a student in sixth standard which was proved from the school register and the statement of her father Iknis Jojo (PW.1). Her age has also been mentioned in the FIR as 14 years. So far as medical evidence is concerned, it was mentioned that the deceased prosecutrix was about 16 years of age. J. So far as the analysis report of the material sent and the DNA report is concerned, it revealed that semen of the appellant was found on the vaginal swab of the deceased. The clothes of the deceased were also found having appellant’s semen spots. The hair which were found near the place of occurrence were found to be that of the appellant. K. The trial court after considering the entire evidence on record, recorded the following findings of fact:

i) The evidence of Sanchit Jojo (PW.2), a child witness was worth placing reliance and it duly supported the case of the prosecution;
ii) His deposition corroborates medical evidence;
iii) The hymen of the deceased was found torn;
iv) Semen of the appellant was found on the slide prepared from the vaginal swab of the prosecutrix as proved by the DNA report;
v) The shawl of the deceased was also found having semen stains which were of the appellant;
vi) The hair found near the body of the prosecutrix were found to be of the appellant as per the DNA report;
vii) The appellant did not take any defence in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. except that he had been falsely implicated by the family of the deceased at the instance of the police and that the appellant did not lead any evidence in his defence.
L. Considering all the aforementioned circumstances and evidence of the relationship with the family of the deceased, the trial court treated it to be a case of extreme culpability and a rarest of rare case awarding death sentence under Section 302 IPC with a fine of Rs. 3,000/-. Under Section 376 IPC, the appellant was awarded rigorous life imprisonment and a fine of Rs.3,000/-; in default of making payment on both counts, sentence of one year on each count was also awarded. For the offence punishable under Section 450 IPC, the appellant was awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.3,000/- and in default, a rigorous imprisonment for one year. However, it was directed that all the sentences would run concurrently.

M. The trial court made a reference to the High Court for affirming the death sentence. The appellant, being aggrieved, also preferred an appeal against his conviction and sentence before the High Court. The appeal and the reference were heard together. N. The High Court recorded the same findings after re- appreciation of evidence and came to the conclusion that prosecutrix was 14 years of age at the time of incident. The appellant was admittedly present in the house but he furnished no explanation whatsoever about the injuries received by the deceased. As the appellant has committed rape upon an innocent and helpless child and then killed her brutally, it has shocked not only the judicial conscience but even the conscience of society as well. The High Court also recorded the finding that the offence had been committed in pre-mediated manner. The death sentence was affirmed and the appeal was dismissed.

Hence, these appeals.

3. Ms. A. Sumathi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, has submitted that the appellant had falsely been implicated by the family members of the deceased at the instance of the police. There is no eye-witness in the case. Sanchit Jojo (PW.2), brother of the prosecutrix, is a child witness and cannot be relied upon simply for the reason that after seeing the incident and knowing well that his sister had been killed, he did not raise any alarm even after the accused had left the spot. Even in the morning, he did not tell his parents when they came back from the agricultural fields as what had happened. Therefore, the courts below have committed a grave error while placing reliance upon the deposition of the child witness. It is a clear cut case of circumstantial evidence for which the prosecution could not furnish explanation on various counts and it cannot be held that appellant had committed rape upon prosecutrix and, subsequently, killed her. The facts and circumstances of the case did not warrant death sentence as awarded by the courts below, and hence, the appeals deserve to be allowed.

4. Per contra, Ms. Vanshaja Shukla, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, has vehemently opposed the appeals contending that the appellant had a pre-meditated intention to commit the offence and that is why he asked the prosecutrix to sleep separately. The chemical analysis report as well as the DNA report make it crystal clear that no other person except the appellant had committed the offence and the manner in which the offence had been committed and the gravity of the offence warrant nothing less than the death sentence and, thus, the appeals lack merit and are liable to be dismissed.

5. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.

6. We have been taken through the impugned judgments rendered by the High Court as well as the trial court and the evidence on record. In view of the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the courts below, particularly in respect of the DNA report to the extent that the semen of the appellant was found in the vagina swab of the prosecutrix and that she died of asphyxia caused by strangulation, we affirm the findings of fact recorded by the courts below.

7. Sanchit Jojo (PW.2), who is an eye-witness, was a child as he was 10 years of age at the time of incident. The courts below have found him worth reliance as he has understood the questions put to him and he was able to answer the same. The issue regarding the admissibility of evidence of a child witness is no more res intergra.

8. It is a settled legal proposition of law that every witness is competent to depose unless the court considers that he is prevented from understanding the question put to him, or from giving rational answers by reason of tender age or extreme old age or disease or because of his mental or physical condition. Therefore, a court has to form an opinion from the circumstances as to whether the witness is able to understand the duty of speaking the truth, and further in case of a child witness, the court has to ascertain that the witness might have not been tutored. Thus, the evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by what others tell him. The trial court must ascertain as to whether a child is able to discern between right or wrong and it may be ascertained only by putting the questions to him.

9. This Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ramesh & Anr., (2011) 4 SCC 786, after considering a large number of its judgments came to the conclusion as under:

“In view of the above, the law on the issue can be summarized to the effect that the deposition of a child witness may require corroboration, but in case his deposition inspires the confidence of the court and there is no embellishment or improvement therein, the court may rely upon his evidence. The evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more carefully with greater circumspection because he is susceptible to tutoring. Only in case there is evidence on record to show that a child has been tutored, the Court can reject his statement partly or fully. However, an inference as to whether child has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of his deposition.” (See also: Suryanarayana v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2001 SC 482).
10. In view of the above, as the courts below have found the child witness worth reliance, we do not see any cogent reason to take a view contrary to the same.

11. Admittedly, the appellant did not take any defence while making his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C., rather boldly alleged that the family of the deceased had roped him falsely at the instance of the police. However, appellant could not reveal as for what reasons the police was by any means inimical to him.

12. The accused has a duty to furnish an explanation in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. regarding any incriminating material that has been produced against him. If the accused has been given the freedom to remain silent during the investigation as well as before the court, then the accused may choose to maintain silence or even remain in complete denial when his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is being recorded. However, in such an event, the court would be entitled to draw an inference, including such adverse inference against the accused as may be permissible in accordance with law. (Vide: Ramnaresh & Ors. v. State of Chhattisgarh, AIR 2012 SC 1357; Munish Mubar v. State of Haryana, AIR 2013 SC 912; and Raj Kumar Singh alias Raju @ Batya v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 2013 SC 3150).

In the instant case, as the appellant did not take any defence or furnish any explanation as to any of the incriminating material placed by the trial court, the courts below have rightly drawn an adverse inference against him.

13. The appellant has not denied his presence in the house on that night. When the children were left in the custody of the appellant, he was bound to explain as under what circumstances Gounjhi died.

14. In Prithipal Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab & Anr., (2012) 1 SCC 10, this Court relying on its earlier judgment in State of W.B. v. Mir Mohammad Omar, AIR 2000 SC 2988, held as under:

“….. if fact is especially in the knowledge of any person, then burden of proving that fact is upon him. It is impossible for the prosecution to prove certain facts particularly within the knowledge of the accused. Section 106 is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. But the section would apply to cases where the prosecution has succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused by virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, failed to offer any explanation which might drive the court to draw a different inference.
Section 106 of the Evidence Act is designed to meet certain exceptional cases, in which, it would be impossible for the prosecution to establish certain facts which are particularly within the knowledge of the accused.” (See also: Neel Kumar alias Anil Kumar v. State of Haryana, (2012) 5 SCC 766; and Gian Chand & Ors. v. State of Haryana, AIR 2013 SC 3395).

15. This Court in Prajeet Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar, (2008) 4 SCC 434 had confirmed the death sentence awarded by the High Court observing that accused had been living as a family member of the victim and had been provided with shelter and meals, despite which he committed ghastly and brutal murder of three defenceless children without any provocation.

16. In a similarly situated case in Kamta Tiwari v. State of M.P., AIR 1996 SC 2800, this Court found that the accused was close to the family of the deceased. The deceased and her siblings used to call the accused uncle and her closeness with the appellant encouraged her to trust him and when the accused had committed the rape and gruesome murder causing numerous injuries on her body, this Court found it to be a fit case for awarding death sentence. The Court observed as under:

“When an innocent hapless girl of 7 years was subjected to such barbaric treatment by a person who was in a position of her trust his culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity and arouses a sense of revulsion in the mind of the common man. In fine, the motivation of the perpetrator, the vulnerability of the victim, the enormity of the crime, the execution thereof persuade us to hold that this is a “rarest of rare” cases where the sentence of death is eminently desirable not only to deter others from committing such atrocious crimes but also to give emphatic expression to society’s abhorrence of such crimes.” (See also: Dhananjoy Chatterjee @ Dhana v. State of W.B., (1994) 2 SCC
220)
17. However, in Bantu @ Naresh Giri v. State of M.P., AIR 2002 SC 70, while dealing with the case of rape and murder of a six years old girl, this Court found that the case was not one of the 'rarest of rare case’. The Court noticed that, accused was less than 22 years at the time of commission of the offence, there were no injuries on the body of the deceased and the death probably occurred as a result of gagging of the nostril by the accused. Thus, the Court while noticing that the crime was heinous, commuted the sentence of death to one of life imprisonment.

18. In Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 2013 SC 3622, this Court dealt with the case of death sentence observing:

“In this context, we are only reminded of the Tamil proverb “[pic]” which means in English “when the fence eats the crops”. When the father himself happens to be the assailant in the commission of such beastly crime, one can visualise the pathetic situation in which the girl would have been placed and that too when such a shameless act was committed in the presence of her own mother. When the daughter and the mother were able to get their grievances redressed by getting the appellant convicted for the said offence of rape one would have in the normal course expected the appellant to have displayed a conduct of remorse.
Unfortunately, the subsequent conduct of the appellant when he was on parole disclosed that he approached the victims in a far more vengeful manner by assaulting the hapless victims which resulted in filing of an FIR once in the year 2005 and subsequently when he was on parole in the year 2006. The monstrous mindset of the appellant appears to have not subsided by mere assault on the victims who ultimately displayed his extreme inhuman behaviour by eliminating his daughter and wife in such a gruesome manner in which he committed the murder by inflicting the injuries on the vital parts of the body of the deceased and that too with all vengeance at his command in order to ensure that they met with instantaneous death. The nature of injuries as described in the post-mortem report speaks for itself as to the vengeance with which the appellant attacked the hapless victims. He was not even prepared to spare his younger daughter viz. PW 2 who, however, escaped the wrath of the appellant by bolting herself inside a room after she witnessed the grotesque manner in which the appellant took away the life of his wife and daughter.” However, the Court concluded that applying various principles culled out from earlier judgments of this Court, the case did not fall within the category of “rarest of rare case”, though it called for a stringent punishment.

19. The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability. Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration alongwith the circumstances of the crime for the reason that life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. The penalty of death sentence may be warranted only in a case where the court comes to the conclusion that imposition of life imprisonment is totally inadequate having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime. The balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so, the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before option is exercised.

Thus, it is evident that for awarding the death sentence, there must be existence of aggravating circumstances and the consequential absence of mitigating circumstances. As to whether death sentence should be awarded, would depend upon the factual scenario of the case in hand.

20. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Swami Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka, AIR 2008 SC 3040, wherein considering the facts of the case, the Court set aside the sentence of death penalty and awarded life imprisonment, but further explained that in order to serve the ends of justice, the appellant therein would not be released from prison till the end of his life.

21. Thus, taking into consideration the aforesaid judgments, we are of the view that in spite of the fact that the appellant had committed a heinous crime and raped an innocent, helpless and defenceless minor girl who was in his custody, he is liable to be punished severely but it is not a case which falls within a category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we set aside the death sentence and award life imprisonment. The appellant must serve a minimum of 35 years in jail without remission, before consideration of his case for pre-mature release. However, it would be subject to clemency power of the Executive.

The appeals stand disposed of",0
"Secretary to Government, School Education Department, Chennai","These appeals have been preferred against the impugned judgments and orders dated 21.11.2012 and 16.11.2012 in Writ Appeal Nos. 2402, 2403 2404, 2405 of 2012 and 2555, 2556 of 2012 passed by the High Court of Madras, by which the High Court has regularised the services of part-time sweepers (respondents herein).

2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are that:

The respondents had been appointed as part-time sweepers by appellant from 1987 till 1993 as their initial appointments had been issued to the respondents and others on 1.12.1987, 2.5.1991, 1.4.1993, 10.4.1993, 27.5.1999 and 19.1.2001. As the respondents and others had been working for more than 10 years, they filed Writ Petition Nos. 17468, 17470, 17472, 17473, 17469 and 17471 of 2012 before the High Court of Madras for seeking regularisation of their services. The said Writ Petitions were allowed by the common judgment and order dated 23.7.2012 with the direction to regularise the services of the respondents on full time basis based on the individual representation after verifying their service particulars from the date of completion of 10 years of service with time scale of pay.

Aggrieved, the appellant preferred the writ appeals which were dismissed.

Hence, these appeals.

3. Shri P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that a direction to regularise the part-time employees itself is contrary to law and the said direction could not have been issued. It has further been submitted that as the impugned judgments and orders had been complied with and the appellant is not going to disturb any of the respondents and others, the law should be clarified on the issue so that in future the High Court may not use the impugned judgment as a precedent.

4. Per contra, Shri P.R. Kovilan P, learned counsel appearing for the respondents has submitted that as the respondents had been working as part-time sweepers for a very long time and not regularising their services would tantamount to exploitation. Therefore, no interference is called for in these appeals.

5. The issue involved here remains restricted as to whether the services of the part-time sweepers could have been directed by the High Court to be regularized. The issue is no more res integra.

In State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Umadevi & Ors., AIR 2006 SC 1806, this Court held as under:

“There is no fundamental right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who were regularly employed. That would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment rules.”
6. In Union of India & Ors. v. A.S. Pillai & Ors., (2010) 13 SCC 448, this Court dealt with the issue of regularisation of part-time employees and the court refused the relief on the ground that part- timers are free to get themselves engaged elsewhere and they are not restrained from working elsewhere when they are not working for the authority/employer. Being the part-time employees, they are not subject to service rules or other regulations which govern and control the regularly appointed staff of the department. Therefore, the question of giving them equal pay for equal work or considering their case for regularisation would not arise.

7. This Court in State of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal & Ors., AIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of regularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in all possible eventualities and laid down well-settled principles relating to regularisation and parity in pay relevant in the context of the issues involved therein. The same are as under:

“8(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution will not issue directions for regularisation, absorption or permanent continuance, unless the employees claiming regularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open competitive process, against sanctioned vacant posts. The equality clause contained in Articles 14 and 16 should be scrupulously followed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularisation of services of an employee which would be violative of the constitutional scheme. While something that is irregular for want of compliance with one of the elements in the process of selection which does not go to the root of the process, can be regularised, back door entries, appointments contrary to the constitutional scheme and/or appointment of ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.
(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or daily-wage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the court, would not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into service, as such service would be “litigious employment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily-wage service for a long number of years, let alone service for one or two years, will not entitle such employee to claim regularisation, if he is not working against a sanctioned post. Sympathy and sentiment cannot be grounds for passing any order of regularisation in the absence of a legal right.
(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation with a cut-off date (that is a scheme providing that persons who had put in a specified number of years of service and continuing in employment as on the cut-off date), it is not possible to others who were appointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or contend that the scheme should be applied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek a direction for framing of fresh schemes providing for successive cut-off dates.
(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularisation as they are not working against any sanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for absorption, regularisation or permanent continuance of part-time temporary employees.
(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run institutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular employees of the Government on the principle of equal pay for equal work. Nor can employees in private employment, even if serving full time, seek parity in salary with government employees. The right to claim a particular salary against the State must arise under a contract or under a statute.” (Emphasis added)
8. The present appeals are squarely covered by clauses (ii), (iv) and (v) of the aforesaid judgment. Therefore, the appeals are allowed. However, in light of the facts and circumstances of the case as Shri P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel has submitted that the appellant has already implemented the impugned judgments and does not want to disturb the services of the respondents, the services of the respondents which stood regularised should not be affected.

With the aforesaid observations, the appeals stand disposed of accordingly. No order as to cost",0
Anil @ Anthony Arikswamy Joseph,"We are, in this case, concerned with a gruesome murder of a minor boy aged 10 years after subjecting him to carnal intercourse and then strangulating him to death.

2. The accused, Anil @ Anthony Arikswamy Joseph, was charge-sheeted with offences punishable under Sections 302, 377 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Principal District and Sessions Judge, Nagpur in Sessions Trial No.167 of 2008 convicted the Appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and sentenced him to death and also sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year and for the offence punishable under Section 377 IPC, he was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months. The Appellant was also convicted for the offence punishable under Section 201 IPC and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months. Substantive sentences, it was ordered, would run concurrently. Since the accused was sentenced to death, reference was sent to the High Court for confirmation of death sentence. The accused also filed Criminal Appeal No.17 of 2011.

3. The Appeal and the criminal confirmation case then came up for hearing before a Division Bench of Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court on 10.08.2011 and the Bench noticed that the DNA profile blood sample and semen sample were not brought before the trial court. Further, it was noticed that PW5, the Assistant Chemical Analyzer of Forensic Science Laboratory, Mumbai, had given detailed evidence in respect of the contents of Ext.35. She stated that she had occasion to compare DNA of blood sample of the accused with Ext.1 (semen stains on half pant) and Ext.5 (anal smear of the deceased) and the DNA samples were matching. PW5 submitted Ext. 38 report. Ext. 38, it was noticed, did not disclose any comparison, as stated by PW5, which was done in FSL at Mumbai. Considering the serious nature of the offence and considering the fact that the whole case against the accused was based on circumstantial evidence, the Court felt that it would be necessary to recall PW5 and record her further examination-in-chief with reference to her report in respect of the DNA profile of the accused, that too with reference to her evidence at paragraph No.3 of her examination–in-chief on 25.09.2009.

4. The Bench, therefore remitted the case to the trial court for production of additional evidence. The operative portion of the order reads as under :

(i) The prayer for production of copies of Judgments in Sessions Trial No.118 of 1997 and Sessions Trial No.39 of 2002 does not survive as it is not pressed.
(ii) The prosecution shall move the learned Trial Court for production of the additional evidence.
(iii) The prosecution shall recall P.W.5 and shall re-examine the said witness further with referenced to the DNA profile of blood sample of the accused and the comparison thereof with Exs.1, 4 and 5 of the report Ex.35.
(iv) The learned Trial Court shall be at liberty to allow the prosecution to produce any other documents connected with the evidence or concerning the collection of samples, carrying the same to F.S.L. and analysis thereof.
(v) The learned Trial Court shall also be at liberty to allow the prosecution to examine any other witness pertaining to or concerning with the collection of samples, carrying the same to F.S.L. and analysis thereof.
(vi) The prosecutions shall recall P.W.10 and P.W.14 and shall examine them further with reference to forwarding samples Exs.1, 4 and 5 of Ex.35 and blood and semen samples of accused- appellant.
(vii) Needless to state that the accused-appellant shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses recalled or fresh witnesses examined following this order.
(viii) It is made clear that the learned trial Court shall be at liberty to pass any incidental order to achieve the purpose of this order, but shall be careful to see that the prosecution does not misuse this opportunity of recording of additional evidence to introduce any other evidence, which is not subject matter of the present order.
(ix) The original record and proceedings be sent back to the learned Sessions Judge, Nagpur.
(x) The learned Sessions Judge shall comply with this order within 30 days from the date of receipt of this order and shall certify the additional evidence to this Court immediately thereof.
Application accordingly stands disposed of.”
5. The Sessions Court, after recording the additional evidence and recalling and further examining the witnesses, as ordered, forwarded the same to the High Court. The appeal was then heard by a Division Bench of the High Court on 10.10.2011 along with the confirmation case and the additional evidence recorded. The High Court, after appreciating the oral and documentary evidence and arguments advanced by the counsel on either side, confirmed the death sentence noticing the brutal and grotesque manner in which the crime was committed. The High Court held that the young boy of tender age was subjected to unnatural sex for the satisfaction of the lust of the accused which, according to the High Court, falls under the category of rarest of the rare cases. The High Court, therefore, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the death sentence, against which these appeals have been preferred.

6. Shri P.C. Aggarwala, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant, submitted that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and all the circumstances put together would lead to only one inference that the accused is not guilty of the offences charged against him. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the prosecution has not succeeded in establishing the last seen theory and the evidence adduced by PW2, PW3, PW8 and PW9 would not establish that the victim was last seen with the accused. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the prosecution could not establish that the articles stated to have been recovered from the house of the accused were that of the deceased. The evidence of PW1 and PW6, it was pointed out, was totally unworthy and ought to have been discarded. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the evidence in respect of DNA Profile is completely manufactured to rope in the accused and the evidence of PW10 and PW14 in that respect cannot be believed.

7. Shri Shankar Chillage, learned counsel appearing for the prosecution, on the other hand, submitted that the Courts below have correctly appreciated the evidence of PW2, PW3, PW8 and PW9 and have come to the conclusion that the victim was last seen in the company of the accused and all the principles laid down by this Court to establish the last seen theory have been completely satisfied, so far as the present case is concerned. Learned counsel also submitted that the evidences of PW1 and PW6 have been correctly appreciated by the Courts below and the prosecution has succeeded in proving that the articles recovered from the possession of the accused were that of the deceased. Learned counsel also submitted that the Courts below have correctly appreciated the evidence of PW5, the Assistant Chemical Analyser, who conducted the DNA test and deposed that she obtained the blood sample of the accused and matched the profile from the blood profile, which was sent as Ex.1 i.e. semen stain cutting from the half pant and submitted the Report Exh.38. Learned counsel submitted that the evidence of PW5 has to be appreciated in the light of the evidence of PW12, PW13, PW15 and PW16, which would clearly indicate that the DNA profile obtained from the anal smear of the deceased matched with the accused. Learned counsel submitted that the DNA profile conclusively indicates that the accused has committed the offence punishable under Section 377 IPC. Learned counsel also submitted that the High Court has rightly held that the case falls under the rarest of the rare category and correctly awarded the death sentence.

8. PW7, Shobha Vaidya, mother of the deceased, a maid servant, was running here and there anxiously for few days to know the whereabouts of her missing son aged 10 years. The boy had gone to the school on 10.1.2008 and normally he used to return in the evening, but on that day he did not return. Since whereabouts of the boy were not known for few days, she lodged a complaint on 15.1.2008 at about 5.00 p.m. before PW10, the Sub- Inspector of Police, attached to Crime Branch, Nagpur, who was posted at Sadar Police Station. Meanwhile, PW2, Mary, a lady, residing near the house of the accused, informed PW10 that the dead body of a boy aged 9-10 years was seen floating in a well at Juna Kabrastan (old cemetery). PW10 then proceeded to the spot and with the assistance of fire brigade took the dead body from the well and sent the same to Mayo Hospital for conducting post-mortem examination. After getting the post-mortem report, PW10 lodged the report and registered the offence under Sections 377, 302 and 201 IPC.

9. PW14, Police Sub-Inspector attached to Sadar Police Station, was entrusted with the investigation. By that time, the accused was arrested on 17.1.2008 and, on his disclosure, various articles belonging to the deceased were recovered from the house of the accused and they were seized in the presence of Panchas. School bag of the deceased, which was black in colour and had pink stripes, concealed in a box was recovered. Bag was opened in the presence of panchas and it was found to contain a Bal Bharati textbook, Mathematics and English books, two note-books, all bore the name of the deceased. Further, a Barmuda pant, belonging to the accused and a jeans belonging to the deceased were recovered on 17.01.2008. The accused was referred for medical examination and the blood sample was taken on 18.01.2008. Samples of blood semen and nail clippings were taken under Ext.17. On the disclosure of the accused, the shirt worn by him, which was concealed near a tree under a stone, was recovered on 22.01.2008. Seized articles were referred to the Chemical Analysis at Nagpur. The reports of the Analyzer are at Exts.91 and 92, while the DNA reports are at Exts.35 and 38. After completing the investigation, the police charge-sheeted the accused for offences punishable under Sections 302, 377 and 201 IPC. On the side of the prosecution, fourteen witnesses were examined and the documentary evidence were brought on record and on the side of the defence, none was examined.

10. PW2, Mary, who runs a tea stall in front of the Income Tax Office, which is near the old cemetery, was examined by the prosecution to prove that the boy was seen in the company of the accused. She stated that she knows the accused who is residing just in front of her house. She has also deposed that on 13.1.2008, the accused had come to her shop and demanded Gutka, which she did not give. Later, a boy of about 11 years was sent from the house of accused, who purchased few items from her shop and returned to the same house. PW3, a neighbour of the accused, is also residing near the old cemetery. She has also deposed that she had seen the boy with the accused on 10.01.2008 and 11.01.2008. PW8, the sister of the accused, who was also residing with the accused in his house, stated that she saw a boy aged about 10 to 12 years in the company of the accused, during the above-mentioned period and on the fateful day, that is, in the mid-night of 12.01.2008 and 13.01.2008, she heard the cries of the boy from the room of the accused. PW9, a neighbour of the accused, also noticed one boy aged 10 years accompanying the accused and that, on the midnight of 12.01.2008, she heard the cries of a small boy emanated from the side of the house of the accused.

11. We have gone through the evidence of PW2, PW3, PW8 and PW9 in its entirety and, in our view, they are trustworthy and reliable. In our view, the prosecution has succeeded in establishing its case beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused and that the findings recorded by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court call for no interference.

12. PW1 and PW6, Panchas of Ex. 13 and Ex.40 respectively, were examined by the prosecution to prove the recovery of the pant as well as school bag of the deceased. School bag was recovered from a box which was placed beneath the cot in the house of the accused. Seizure panchanams vide Exts.15 and 19 give the details of the articles seized at the instance of the accused. The school bag contained books and note books which bore the name of the deceased. The pant and the school bag along with books contained therein would clearly indicate that the boy was in the company of the accused on the fateful day. Consequently, the presence of the deceased in the room of the accused has been clearly established and the finding recorded by the trial Court as well as the High Court on that ground also calls for no interference.

13. PW4 is the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination of dead body of the deceased. The post-mortem report (Exh.33) indicates the following external and internal injuries on the dead body of the deceased :

“External Injuries
1) Anus dilated and appears patalous, perional margin and mucosa appear inflamed, no evidence of tear or foreign body.
2) Position of Limbus straight.
3) Multiple contused abrasions (6 in numbers) present over forehead of size varying from 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm to 2 cm x 2 cm.
4) Incised wound present over right lateral forehead oblique of size 1.5 cm x 0.5 cm x bone deep.
5) Contused abrasion at right preauricular area of size 2 cm x 2 cm.
6) Contused abrasion at right face, 1.5 cm below the lower eye lid of size 2 cm x 2.5 cm.
7) Centurion present at chin of size 2 cm x 2.5 cm.
8) Graze abrasion present at right arm, anteri medial aspect, lower 1/3rd of size 3.5 cm x 5 cm directed downward and right laterally.
Internal Injuries (1) Right frontal region of size 4 cm x 5 cm x 0.5 cm. (2) Right parieto-temporal region of size 5 cm x 4 cm x 0.5 cm. (3) Left occipital region of size 4 cm x 4 cm x 0.5 cm.
Brain, party reddish tinged appearance to the right parieto- temporal region.”
14. PW4 has stated that all the internal injuries correspond to external injuries and they were ante-mortem and were ordinarily sufficient to cause death. PW4 has also opined that there was possibility of carnal intercourse with the deceased, though the cause of death was head injury. PW4 also stated that he had seen the DNA report at Exh.35 and stated that the report indicates that anal smear of the deceased gave a mixed DNA profile which matches with semen on half pant and blood of victim. PW4 was also shown another report of DNA, which was in respect of the control sample blood of the accused and stated that DNA profile of blood matches with DNA profile of semen found in the anus of the deceased. Further, he has also stated that injury nos.1, 3, 4 and 5 were possible by hard and blunt object while injury no.2 was caused by sharp cutting edge and injury no.6 was caused by hard and rough object. Facts clearly indicate that the fatal injuries were caused to silence him, after satisfying lust in a barbaric manner. Attempts were made to destroy the evidence which were also proved. PW4 also categorically stated in respect of injury no.1 that it should read as anus dilated and appears patalous, perianal margin anal mucosa appear inflamed, though no evidence of tear or foreign body.

15. PW5, the Assistant Chemical Analyzer, Forensic Science Lab, Kalina, Mumbai stated that she had received the parcels from the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, Nagpur on 24.1.2008 and she started the analysis on the same day. She stated that Exh.1 is a DNA profile of the accused and Exh.5 anal smear is of the deceased, which gave mixed profile. Further, it is stated that the profile obtained from Exh.1 semen stains matches with the profile obtained from Exh.5 anal smear and also Exh.4 blood stains gauze collected from the deceased. She stated that she conducted two tests, one nuclear Short Tandem Repeats (STR) and Y Short Tandem Repeats (YSTR). PW5, in her report, stated that she obtained blood samples of the accused and matched the profile obtained from that blood with the profile of Exhs.1 and 5 and that the profiles were matching. PW5, as already indicated, was recalled after the matter was remitted to the trial Court for getting further evidence and she repeated that she had analyzed the blood sample of the accused for DNA profiling and it matched with the sample, which was sent as Exh.1 i.e. semen stain cutting from the half pant. She accordingly issued a report as Exh.38.

16. PW12, the Medical Officer attached to Mayo Hospital, Nagpur was examined to prove that he had received the requisition for taking blood samples, pubic hair, nails and semen of the accused under requisition at Exh.75, which was handed over to the police. PW15 and PW16 were also examined to establish the procedure followed for taking the parcel to the Chemical Analyser for DNA test as well as for collecting blood samples, etc. On going through the evidence of PW4 and PW5 read with evidence of PW12, PW15 and PW16, we are of the view that the DNA test was successfully conducted and that the anal smear matched with the DNA profile of semen stains which were found on the pant of the accused and were matched with the control blood sample of the accused as well as blood sample of the deceased.

17. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a molecule that encodes the genetic information in all living organisms. DNA genotype can be obtained from any biological material such as bone, blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, etc. Now, for several years, DNA profile has also shown a tremendous impact on forensic investigation. Generally, when DNA profile of a sample found at the scene of crime matches with DNA profile of the suspect, it can generally be concluded that both samples have the same biological origin. DNA profile is valid and reliable, but variance in a particular result depends on the quality control and quality procedure in the laboratory.

18. PW5, Dr. Varsha Rathod, stated that since 1994 she was working as Assistant Chemical Analyzer and has analyzed thousands of samples including DNA test. She has stated that she had conducted two tests, one STR and second YSTR. Both the tests are scientifically proven and the competence of the doctor who conducted the test is also not questioned. Consequently, the DNA test report could be safely accepted, which shows that the deceased boy was subjected to unnatural sex and offence under Section 377 has been clearly made out.

19. Section 377 is mainly confined to act of sodomy, buggery and bestiality, which intends to punish a man when he indulges in a carnal intercourse against the order of nature with a man or, in the same manner, with a woman. Sodomy is termed as Pederasty when the intercourse is between a man and a young boy, that is, when the passive agent is a young boy. Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology state that if a passive agent is not accustomed to sodomy, abrasions on the skin near the anus is likely to appear and lesions will be most marked in children while they may be almost absent in adults, when there is no resistance to the anal coitus. Galster’s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology say that lesions like recent lacerations, bruising, inflammation of the mucous membrane could be noticed in passive agent. Article 377 postulates penetration by the penis into the anus and the merest penetration suffices to establish the offence. PW4 has clearly noticed that “Anus dilated and appears patalous, perional margin and mucosa appear inflamed”. DNA test also proved that anal smear matched with the DNA profile of smear stains, which also matched with the control sample of the accused. Consent of a passive agent is not at all a defence, but, in the instant case, though a suggestion was made that the boy had not resisted, being in the company of the accused for few days, is of no consequence, he being a minor. Prosecution has clearly established that, after subjecting the boy to Pederasty, he was strangulated to death.

20. PW8 has categorically stated that she had heard the cries of the boy during mid-night and she could not sleep till the cries subsided. PW8 is none other than the sister of the accused. She heard the cries of the boy coming from the room of the accused. She is a trustworthy witness and has no axe to grind against the accused. PW9 has also stated that she wanted to go to the direction in which she heard the cries, however, darkness deterred her and others proceeding to the place of occurrence. Cries heard were obviously in loud voice, which indicates that the accused had indulged in such a barbaric act and ultimately killed the boy and later threw the dead body in the well situated near the premises of the old cemetery, a spot which was located behind his house. The Courts below, therefore, concluded that the offence committed by the accused shows extreme depravity of mind and shows extreme perversity and, therefore, calls for extreme punishment i.e. the accused be hanged by neck till death. We are of the opinion that the case under Sections 302, 377 and 201 IPC has been clearly made out. The question is only with regard to the sentence and whether the present case falls under the category of rarest of rare case, warranting capital punishment.

21. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra (2013) 5 SCC 546, we have dealt with the various principles to be applied while awarding death sentence. In that case, we have referred to the cases wherein death penalty was awarded by this Court for murder of minor boys and girls and cases where death sentence had been commuted in the cases of murder of minor boys and girls. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), we have also extensively referred to the principles laid down in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) 2 SCC 684 and Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983) 3 SCC 470 and the subsequent decisions. Applying the tests laid down in Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), we are of the view that in the instant case the crime test and criminal test have been fully satisfied against the accused. Still, we have to apply the RR test and examine whether the society abhors such crimes and whether such crimes shock the conscience of the society and attract intense and extreme indignation of the community.

22. We have no doubt in our mind that such types of crimes preceded by Pederasty are extremely brutal, grotesque diabolical and revolting, which shock the moral fiber of the society, especially when the passive agent is a minor. Recently, this Court in Suresh Kumar Koushal and Another v. Naz Foundation and Others (2014) 1 SCC 1 has also refused to strike down Section 377, even if such acts are indulged in by consenting individuals.

23. Accused is now around 42 years of age and when he committed the crime, he was about 35 years. We have clearly found that there is no mitigating circumstance favouring the accused. Age is not a factor favouring him. By the age of 35, a person attains sufficient maturity and can distinguish what is good or bad, and there is nothing to show that he was under any emotional or mental stress and the offence was committed only to satisfy his lust, in a perverted way. Accused is not the only son of his parents, but the boy was a minor, totally innocent and defenceless, the only son of PW7. The mother, PW7, is a house maid and the son would have looked after her in her old age and also would have been of considerable help to her. Son was snatched in a barbaric gruesome manner only to satisfy the perverted lust of the accused. PW7, the mother had to see the dead body of the son floating in the well. PW8, the sister of the accused and PW9, the neighbour, both ladies heard the cries of the helpless boy during mid-night but both were helpless. PW8 could not go out of her room since it was locked from outside. PW9, a lady could not go to the house of the accused due to pitched darkness.

24. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), this Court did not confirm the death sentence, even though the post-mortem spelt out the act of sodomy as the prosecution had failed to chargesheet the accused under Section 377 IPC, which was commented upon by this Court. But, so far as the present case is concerned, the offences under Section 302 and 377 have been fully established and both the crime test and the criminal test have been fully satisfied against the accused. Now, we have to apply the RR Test.

25. We may point out that apart from what has been stated in Bachan Singh’s case (supra) and Machhi Singh’s case (supra) this Court in various cases like Om Prakash v. State of Haryana (1999) 3 SCC 19, State of U.P. v. Sattan (2009) 4 SCC 736, Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 6 SCC 498, held that Court must state special reasons to impose death penalty, hence, the RR Test.

RR Test

26. R-R Test, we have already held in Shankar Kisanrao Khade’ case (supra), depends upon the perception of the society that is “society- centric” and not “Judge-centric”, that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not. While applying that test, the court has to look into variety of factors like society’s abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy of certain types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of minor girls, intellectually challenged minor girls, minors suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women, etc. R-R Test is found satisfied in several cases by this Court like in Bantu v. State of U.P. (2008) 11 SCC 113, wherein this Court affirmed the death sentence in a case where minor girl of five years was raped and murdered. This Court noticed that the victim was an innocent child and the murderer was in a dominating position, which the Court found as a vital factor justifying the award of capital punishment. Shivaji v. State of Maharashtra (2008) 15 SCC 269, was a case where a married person having three children, known to the family of the deceased, ravished the life of a girl aged 9 years and strangulated her to death, this Court affirmed the death sentence awarded by the High Court. Mohd. Mannan v. State of Bihar (2011) 5 SCC 317, was a case where a minor girl aged 7 years was kidnapped, raped and murdered by an accused aged between 42-43 years. This Court held that he would be a menace to society and would continue to be so and could not be reformed and hence confirmed the death sentence. Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra (2012) 4 SCC 37 was a case where a 3 year old child was raped and murdered by an accused of 31 years old. This Court noticed the brutal manner in which the crime was committed and the pain and agony undergone by the minor girl. This Court confirmed the death sentence.

27. In Haresh Mohandas Rajput v. State of Maharashtra (2011) 12 SCC 56, this Court opined that the death sentence, in a given case, can be awarded where the victims are innocent children and helpless women, especially when the crime is committed in a most cruel and inhuman manner which is extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical and revolting. Reference may also be made to the Judgments of this Court in Rabindra Kumar Pal alias Dara Singh v. Republic of India (2011) 2 SCC 490, Surendra Koli v. State of U.P. and others (2011) 4 SCC 80 and Sudam @ Rahul Kaniram Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra (2011) 7 SCC 125.

28. This Court in Mahesh v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1987) 3 SCC 80 deprecated the practice of taking a lenient view and not imposing the appropriate punishment observing that it will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and cruel acts. This Court further held that to give the lesser punishment for the appellants would be to render the justicing system of this country suspect and the common man will lose faith in courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon. In Bantu (supra), this Court placing reliance on the Judgment in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N. (1991) 3 SCC 471 observed as follows:

“Therefore, undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law, and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc. Thus, it is evident that criminal law requires strict adherence to the rule of proportionality in providing punishment according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping in mind the effect of not awarding just punishment on the society.
The “rarest of the rare case” comes when a convict would be a menace and threat to the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of the society. Where an accused does not act on any spur of the moment provocation and he indulged himself in a deliberately planned crime and meticulously executed it, the death sentence may be the most appropriate punishment for such a ghastly crime.”
29. We may indicate, unlike Shankar Kisanrao Khade’ case (supra), in this case offence under Section 377 IPC has been fully proved so also the offence under Section 302 IPC. Indian society and also the International society abhor pederasty, an unnatural sex, i.e. carnal intercourse between a man and a minor boy or a girl. When the victim is a minor, consent is not a defence, irrespective of the views expressed at certain quarters on consensual sex between adults.

Reformation and Rehabilitation

30. Learned counsel for the accused submitted that the accused has no previous criminal history and would not be a menace to the society. Further, it was also pointed out that possibility of reformation or rehabilitation of the accused, who is aged 42 years, cannot be ruled out and the State has not discharged its responsibility of proving the impossibility of rehabilitation.

31. In Bachan Singh (supra), this Court has categorically stated, “the probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the society”, is a relevant circumstance, that must be given great weight in the determination of sentence. This was further expressed in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar (supra). Many-a-times, while determining the sentence, the Courts take it for granted, looking into the facts of a particular case, that the accused would be a menace to the society and there is no possibility of reformation and rehabilitation, while it is the duty of the Court to ascertain those factors, and the State is obliged to furnish materials for and against the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the accused. Facts, which the Courts, deal with, in a given case, cannot be the foundation for reaching such a conclusion, which, as already stated, calls for additional materials. We, therefore, direct that the criminal courts, while dealing with offences like Section 302 IPC, after conviction, may, in appropriate cases, call for a report to determine, whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated, which depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

32. Learned counsel also pointed out that the accused had not kidnapped the boy, who voluntarily came and stayed with him. Learned counsel also pointed out that the entire case rests upon circumstantial evidence and generally in the absence of ocular evidence, death sentence is seldom awarded. Reference was made to few judgments of this Court in support of his contention, such as State of Maharashtra v. Mansingh (2005) 3 SCC 131 and Bantu v. State of M.P. (2001) 9 SCC 615. Learned counsel also made reference to few judgments of this Court where death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, such as Aloke Nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal (2007) 12 SCC 230, Sahdeo v. State of U.P. (2004) 10 SCC 682, Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka (2007) 12 SCC 288, Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), Haresh Mohandas Rajput (supra), Rajesh Kumar v. State (2011) 13 SCC 706, Amit v. State of U.P. (2012) 4 SCC 107, etc.

33. PW8 and PW9 heard the cries of the minor boy during the midnight of 12.01.2008 and after going through their evidence they reverberate in our ears. Injury Nos.1, 3 to 5 were inflicted by hard and blunt object, while injury no.2 was caused by sharp cutting edge and injury no.6 was caused by hard and rash object, over and above, the offence under Section 377 also stood proved. The murder was committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical and dastardly manner and the accused was in a dominating position and the victim was an innocent boy, the only son of his mother. Accused was aged 35 years when the crime was committed that is he was a fully matured person. Life of a boy, the only son of PW7, the mother, was taken away in a gruesome and barbaric manner which pricks not only the judicial conscience but also the conscience of the society.

34. Legislative policy is discernible from Section 235(2) read with Section 354(3) of the Cr.P.C., that when culpability assumes the proportions of depravity, the Court has to give special reasons within the meaning of Section 354(3) for imposition of death sentence. Legislative policy is that when special reasons do exist, as in the instant case, the Court has to discharge its constitutional obligations and honour the legislative policy by awarding appropriate sentence, that is the will of the people. We are of the view that incarceration of a further period of thirty years, without remission, in addition to the sentence already undergone, will be an adequate punishment in the facts and circumstances of the case, rather than death sentence. Ordered accordingly.

35. The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of",0
"COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER,RAJASTHAN","The Revenue is in appeal before us against the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Rajasthan at Jodhpur in S.B. Sales Tax Revision Petition No.582 of 1999, dated 02.07.2001 whereby and whereunder the High Court has dismissed the revision petition filed by the Revenue and upheld the case of the respondent-assessee.

2. The respondent-assessee is a new industrial unit manufacturing cement situated within Panchayat Samiti, Pindwara, Rajasthan. It is an admitted fact that it started its commercial production on 27.05.1997. It is also not disputed that the respondent-assessee has fixed capital investment (for short, “the FCI”) exceeding Rs.500/- Crores and employs more than 250 employees.

3. The core issue arises out of the respondent-assessee’s application for grant of eligibility certificate for exemption from payment of Central Sales Tax and Rajasthan Sales Tax to the State Level Screening Committee, Jaipur under the “Sales Tax New Incentive Scheme for Industries, 1989” (for short “the Scheme”).

4. For convenience of discussion, we would first notice the relevant scheme and certain provisions and thereafter proceed towards analysis of the facts in the instant case. The Scheme for exemption from payment of sales tax was notified by the State of Rajasthan in exercise of its powers under sub-section(2) of Section 4 of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 (for short, “the Act”). The scheme exempts certain industrial units from payment of tax on the sale of goods manufactured by them within the State. It specifies and categorizes the districts, types of units, the extent of exemption from tax (in percentage), the maximum exemption available in terms of percentage of fixed capital investment (FCI) and the maximum time limit for availing such exemption from tax. By introducing a deeming clause, the scheme is deemed to have come into operation with effect from 05.03.1987 and to remain in force upto 31.03.1992. An amendment to the aforesaid notification was brought in by issuing notification – S. No.763: F.4(35) FD/ Gr.IV/87-38, dated 06.07.1989 and was made operative/effective with effect from 05.03.1987 and to remain in force upto 31.03.1995. Yet another amendment was introduced by the State Government by issuing notification No.763: F.4(35)FD/Gr.IV/87-38 dated 06.07.1989. Once again by introducing a deeming clause, the notification was made operative with effect from 05.03.1987 and to remain in force upto 31.03.1997. The State Government has issued another subsequent notification amending the earlier notification in exercise of its power under Section 4(2) of the Act in 763: F.4(35)FD/Gr.IV/87-38, dated 06.07.1989 which is deemed to have come into operation with effect from 05.03.1987 and to remain in force upto 31.03.1998. Clause 1 of the scheme notification provides for its operation. Clause 2 is the dictionary clause which provides for meaning of the expressions like “New Industrial Unit”, “Sick Industrial Unit”, “Eligible Fixed Capital Investment” etc. For the purpose of this case, we require to notice the definitions of New Industrial Unit, Eligible Fixed Capital Investment, Prestigious Unit and Very Prestigious Unit.

5. Clause 2(a) defines the meaning of the expression ‘New Industrial Unit’ to mean an industrial unit which commences commercial production during the operative period of the scheme. The definition provides an exclusion of certain industries from the purview of New Industrial Unit. They are industrial units established by transferring or shifting or dismantling an existing industry and an industrial unit established on the site of an existing unit manufacturing similar goods. Explanation I and II appended to the notification need not be noticed by us, since the same is not necessary for the purpose of disposal of this appeal.

6. It is neither in dispute nor could be disputed by the revenue that the respondent is not a ‘New Industrial Unit’.

7. Clause 2(e) defines eligible fixed capital investment (FCI) to mean investment made in land, new buildings, new plant and machinery and imported second hand machinery from outside the country and installation expenditure capitalized for plant and machinery and installation capitalized for plant and machinery’s capitalized interest during construction not exceeding 5% of the total fixed capital investment; and technical know-how fees or drawing fees paid in lump-sum to foreign collaborators or foreign suppliers as approved by Government of India or paid to laboratories recognized by the State Government or Central Government and Rail Sidings, rolling stock, racks and railway engines, owned by the unit.

8. Clause 2(i) defines ‘Prestigious Unit’. The same is as under:-

“Prestigious Unit” means a “new industrial unit” first established in any Panchayat Samiti of the State during the period of this Scheme in which investment in fixed capital exceeds Rs.10/- cores with a minimum permanent employment of 250 persons or a “new industrial unit” having a fixed capital investment exceeding Rs.25.00 crores and with a minimum permanent employment of 250 persons or a new electronic industrial unit having fixed capital investment exceeding Rs.25/- crores’.
9. The definition is in three parts. The first part speaks of a ‘New Industrial Unit’ first established in any Panchayat Samiti of the State. The establishment is of the unit during the period of the Scheme. The investment in fixed capital must exceed Rs.10/- crores and lastly the industrial unit has minimum permanent employment of 250 persons. In the second limb, the necessity of establishing the ‘New Industrial Unit’ in Panchayat Samiti is done away with. The unit should have capital investment exceeding Rs.25/- crores and should have minimum permanent employment of 250 persons. The third limb of this definition applies only to Electronic Industrial Unit having fixed capital investment exceeding Rs.25/- crores.

10. Clause 2(ii) defines the expression “Very Prestigious Unit” as under:

“Very Prestigious Unit” means a new industrial unit established in any Panchayat Samiti of the State during the period of this Scheme in which investment in fixed capital is Rs.100/- crores or more. However, the progressive investment of the amount of project cost as appraised by the financial institutions shall be considered as investment made by a new unit, and as soon as such investment reaches or crosses the point of Rs.100/- crores during the operative period of the Scheme, the unit shall acquire the status of a Very Prestigious Unit for the purpose of claiming enhanced proportionate benefits under this Scheme”.
11. The ‘Very Prestigious Unit’ means a new industrial unit established in any Panchayat Samiti in the State during the operative period of the Scheme and the other important requirement is the investment in such industrial unit must be Rs.100/- crores or more. The second limb of the definition clause provides for a new industrial unit to acquire the status of Very Prestigious Unit. The project cost as appraised by the financial institution shall be considered as investment made by a new unit. The progressive investment of the amount of project cost as soon as it reaches or crosses the point of Rs.100/- crores during the operation of the Scheme, the industrial unit shall acquire the status of a Very Prestigious Unit in order to claim enhanced proportionate benefits under the Scheme.

12. Clause 2(k) provides for constitution of Screening Committee for the purpose of consideration and to grant Eligibility Certificate under the New Incentive Scheme both for small and medium and also large scale industrial units to avail benefit under the New Incentive Scheme. The note appended to this sub-clause speaks of Small Scale Units, Medium Scale Units and Large Scale Units. Small Scale Units means a unit of which investment in plant and machinery does not exceed Rs.60/- Lakhs, a Medium Scale Unit means a unit of which the project cost does not exceed Rs. Five Crores and Large Scale Unit means a unit of which the project cost exceeds Rs. Five Crores.

13. Clause 3 of the notification speaks of applicability of the Scheme. By this clause, the State Government has made the Scheme applicable to (a) new industrial units, (b) industrial units going in for expansion or diversification and (c) sick units.

14. Clause 4 of the Scheme provides for exemption from Payment of Sales Tax as per parameters mentioned in Annexure ‘C’ to the said notification. This clause also envisages that the industrial unit which is granted an eligibility certificate by the Screening Committee is alone exempted to claim benefit of this notification.

15. Annexure ‘C’ provides for the quantum of sales tax exemption under the Scheme. Para C therein is relevant for the purpose of this case, therefore, omitting what is not necessary is extracted hereunder:-

16. As we have observed earlier, Annexure-C has five columns. The second column speaks of type of units, the third column speaks of the extent of percentage of exemption from tax, the fourth column provides for the maximum exemption in terms of percentage of FCI and the fifth and the last column provides the maximum time limit for availing exemption from tax. Prior to issuance of notification dated 13.12.1996, Annexure ‘C’ was primarily confined to ‘New Units’. After the introduction of notification dated 13.12.1996, the exclusion is made to the expression ‘New Units’ by specifically including certain type of industrial units by inserting items 1A to 1F. Item 1E specifically talks of New Cement Units except in Tribal Sub-Plan area. The extent of percentage of exemption from tax under Item 1E depends on the type of unit or the industry. If it is a small scale unit, the extent of exemption is 75%, if it is medium scale, the extent of exemption is 50%, and if it is large scale unit, the extent of percentage of exemption from tax is 25%. The maximum time limit for availing exemption from tax is restricted to seven years. Item 4 speaks of New Units producing pollution control equipments, pioneering units and prestigious units. The extent of the percentage of exemption from tax is 75% of total liability and the maximum time limit for availing exemption from tax is 9 years from the date of commercial production. Item 5 relates to New Very Prestigious Units other than cement units except in Tribal Sub-plan Area and the total percentage of exemption from tax is 90% of total tax liability and the maximum time limit for availing exemption from tax is eleven years.

17. Reverting to state the facts, the respondent-assessee had applied to the State Level Screening Committee for claiming benefit of exemption at 75% under the Scheme. The Committee rejected the claim of the respondent- assessee and observed that since the respondent-assessee is a large scale unit covered under the specific provision of Item 1E of Annexure ‘C’, it is entitled to 25% exemption, by its order dated 15.01.1998.

18. Being aggrieved by the said order, the respondent-assessee filed appeal before Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer (for short, ‘the Board’) in respect of the calculation of eligible FCI as well as the exemption under the Scheme. The Board while remanding the matter to the State Level Screening Committee held that the respondent-assessee is entitled to 75% tax exemption by holding the respondent-unit as Prestigious Unit under the Scheme.

19. The revenue being aggrieved by the decision of the Board, filed Tax Revision Petition before the High Court under Section 86(2) of the Act. The High Court dismissed the revision petition filed by the revenue and upheld the decision of the Board by holding that the respondent-unit is a Prestigious Unit and therefore, entitled to 75% tax exemption under the Scheme.

20. Aggrieved by the order so passed by the High Court, the Revenue is before us in this appeal.

21. We have heard learned counsel for the parties to the lis and perused the documents on record as well as the order(s) passed by the authorities and the High Court, respectively.

22. Shri Rohington Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submits that the case pleaded by respondent-unit right from the beginning of filing the application before the State Level Screening Committee was that the new unit had made an investment of more than Rs.500/- crores by way of fixed capital assets and therefore they should be placed under the category of ‘Prestigious Unit’ and accordingly be granted eligibility certificate to claim 75% of exemption from tax for the maximum time limit provided under the Scheme. In aid of this submission, the learned senior counsel would draw our attention to the application and the accompanying affidavit filed by the respondent-new unit before the State Level Screening Committee. He would further contend that the respondent-unit before all the authorities below including the High Court had adopted the stand that the fixed capital investment excluding investment made before 05.03.1987 was more than Rs.532/- crores and therefore the respondent-unit is a Prestigious Unit entitled to an exemption of 75% of total tax liability. It is further contended that the respondent-new unit being New Cement Unit and further being large scale unit though can avail the benefit of the incentive scheme under 1E of Annexure ‘C’ which provides for exemption upto 25% of total liabilities, it cannot avail the benefit of exemption at the rate of 75% under Item 4 as Prestigious Unit. He would further submit that benefit to cement industry is confined to the extent envisaged under the Item 1E of Annexure-C as the said item is a specific provision relating to cement industry and thus would prevail over other provisions which are general in character in terms of reference to new cement unit. Alternatively, it is contended that the respondent-unit being new cement unit, it may fall under `New Very Prestigious Unit’, however Item 5 of Annexure `C’ speaks of the New Very Prestigious Units other than cement units except those located in Sub-Plan area, respondent-unit may not be entitled to avail the benefit of the Scheme.

23. Per contra, learned counsel, Shri Sudhir Gupta would justify the reasoning and the conclusion reached by the High Court while rejecting the revenue’s revision petition and thereby confirming the view expressed by the Board. He would, inter alia, submit that Item 1E is only an exception to the general rule envisaged in Item 1 and not an exception to the other Items in the Annexure-C, i.e., Items 2 to 7 as it is not intended to govern the entire field of exemptions made available to the cement industry so as to deny the benefits to a unit even if it falls under another Item envisaging better incentives. He would further submit that since new cement unit is specifically excluded from application of Item 1 (new units generally), Item 2 (expanding/diversifying unit) and Item 5 (very prestigious unit) but not Item 4 (prestigious units), Item 6 (export oriented prestigious/pioneering unit) and Item 7 (export oriented very prestigious units), it falls that the intention behind such express exclusion is such that but for the said exclusion, cement industries would be included in the said entries. He would strenuously submit that since the tax exemption clauses are made with a beneficent object, i.e., to encourage investment in specified rural/semi-urban areas, their construction must be liberal such as to confer the most beneficial meaning to the provisions.

24. The facts which are not in dispute are that the respondent-assessee (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Company’) established a new cement unit within Panchayat Samiti, Pindwara and commenced commercial production some time in the year 1997. It engaged itself in the manufacture of cement. The total capital investment – (FCI) in the new industrial unit claimed by the Company was Rupees 53252.87 Lakhs (Rs.532.52/- crores)

25. The Company had applied for grant of Eligibility Certificate for exemption from payment of Central Sales Tax and Rajasthan Sales Tax before the State Level Screening Committee, Jaipur, under the Scheme. However, the Screening Committee accepted only Rs.5553.72 Lakhs (Rs.55.32 crores) as FCI eligible for availing the benefits under the Scheme. On the aforesaid basis the State Level Screening Committee certified that the company is entitled to avail exemption of tax to the extent of 25% of the tax liability by treating the same to be a Large Scale Industry. In the appeal, the Board took the view since the Company had invested more than Rs.25 crores and has employed more than 250 workmen, it has the status of `New Prestigious Unit’ and thus, falls within the definition of a Prestigious Unit and should be governed by Item 4 of Annexure `C’ being entitled to avail 75% of total tax liability. This view, as we have already observed, is accepted by the High Court, while dismissing the tax revision petition filed by the revenue.

26. At the outset, we would observe that the High Court has erred in reaching its conclusion by holding that (a) the respondent-company would fall into all the three categories of industries referred to in the Scheme, that is to say it is a new unit which is a ‘Large Scale Unit’, a “Prestigious New Unit” and also a “Very Prestigious Unit”; (b) the classification of a new unit, viz. small scale, medium scale and large scale under item 1E on the basis of scale of investment does not denude a new industrial unit of any type of the special status of “Pioneer”, “Prestigious” and “Very Prestigious” unit under items 4 and 5 to also exclude operation of General entry; and (c) the special entry would not exclude the applicability of general entry in context of the Scheme so as to exclude the operation of items 4, 6 and 7. Thereby implying that though there exists an overlap between the general and special provision, the general provision would also be sustained and the two would co-exist.

27. Before we deal with the fact situation in the present appeal, we reiterate the settled legal position in law, that is, if in a Statutory Rule or Statutory Notification, there are two expressions used, one in General Terms and the other in special words, under the rules of interpretation, it has to be understood that the special words were not meant to be included in the general expression. Alternatively, it can be said that where a Statute contains both a General Provision as well as specific provision, the later must prevail.

28. We are mindful of the principle that the Court should examine every word of a statute in its context and must use context in its widest sense. We are also in acquaintance with observations of this Court in Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd., 1987 SCR (2) 1 where Chinnappa Reddy, J. noting the importance of the context in which every word is used in the matter of interpretation of statutes held thus:

“Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the basis of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute- maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.”
29. It is well established that when a general law and a special law dealing with some aspect dealt with by the general law are in question, the rule adopted and applied is one of harmonious construction whereby the general law, to the extent dealt with by the special law, is impliedly repealed. This principle finds its origins in the latin maxim of generalia specialibus non derogant, i.e., general law yields to special law should they operate in the same field on same subject. (Vepa P. Sarathi, Interpretation of Statutes, 5th Ed., Eastern Book Company; N. S. Bindra’s Interpretation of Statutes, 8th Ed., The Law Book Company; Craies on Statute Law, S.G.G.Edkar, 7th Ed., Sweet & Maxwell; Justice G.P. Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 13th Ed., LexisNexis; Craies on Legislation, Daniel Greenberg, 9th Ed., Thomson Sweet & Maxwell, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed., Lexis Nexis)

30. Generally, the principle has found vast application in cases of there being two statutes: general or specific with the latter treating the common subject matter more specifically or minutely than the former. Corpus Juris Secundum, 82 C.J.S. Statutes § 482 states that when construing a general and a specific statute pertaining to the same topic, it is necessary to consider the statutes as consistent with one another and such statutes therefore should be harmonized, if possible, with the objective of giving effect to a consistent legislative policy. On the other hand, where a general statute and a specific statute relating to the same subject matter cannot be reconciled, the special or specific statute ordinarily will control. The provision more specifically directed to the matter at issue prevails as an exception to or qualification of the provision which is more general in nature, provided that the specific or special statute clearly includes the matter in controversy. (Edmond v. U.S., 520 U.S. 651, Warden, Lewisburg Penitentiary v. Marrero, 417 U.S. 653)

31. The maxim generalia specialibus non derogant is dealt with in Volume 44 (1) of the 4th ed. of Halsbury's Laws of England at paragraph 1300 as follows:

“The principle descends clearly from decisions of the House of Lords in Seward v. Owner of “The Vera Cruz”, (1884) 10 App Cas 59 and the Privy Council in Barker v Edger, [1898] AC 748 and has been affirmed and put into effect on many occasions.... If Parliament has considered all the circumstances of, and made special provision for, a particular case, the presumption is that a subsequent enactment of a purely general character would not have been intended to interfere with that provision; and therefore, if such an enactment, although inconsistent in substance, is capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending to the case in question, it is prima facie to be construed as not so extending. The special provision stands as an exceptional proviso upon the general. If, however, it appears from a consideration of the general enactment in the light of admissible circumstances that Parliament's true intention was to establish thereby a rule of universal application, then the special provision must give way to the general.”
32. The question in Seward v. Owner of the “Vera Cruz”, (1884) 10 App Cas 59 was whether Section 7 of the Admiralty Court Act of 1861, which gave jurisdiction to that Court over “any claim for damage done by any ship” also gave jurisdiction over claims for loss of life which would otherwise come under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1846. It was held that the general words of Section 7 of the Admiralty Court Act did not exclude the applicability of the Fatal Accidents Act and therefore, the Admiralty Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a claim for damages for loss of life.

33. The adoption of the aforesaid rule in application of principle of harmonious construction has been explained by Kasliwal J. while expressing his partial dissent to the majority judgment in St. Stephen’s College v. University of Delhi, (1992) 1 SCC 558 as follows:

“140. …The golden rule of interpretation is that words should be read in the ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning and the principle of harmonious construction merely applies the rule that where there is a general provision of law dealing with a subject, and a special provision dealing with the same subject, the special prevails over the general. If it is not constructed in that way the result would be that the special provision would be wholly defeated. The House of Lords observed in Warburton v. Loveland, (1824-34) All ER Rep 589 as under:
“No rule of construction can require that when the words of one part of statute convey a clear meaning … it shall be necessary to introduce another part of statute which speaks with less perspicuity, and of which the words may be capable of such construction, as by possibility to diminish the efficacy of the first part.” (Anandji Haridas and Co. (P) Ltd. v. S.P. Kasture, (1968) 1 SCR 661, Patna Improvement Trust v. Lakshmi Devi, 1963 Supp (2) SCR 812, Ethiopian Airlines v. Ganesh Narain Saboo, (2011) 8 SCC 539, Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon v. State of Gujarat, (1988) 2 SCC 271, South India Corpn. (P) Ltd. v. Secy., Board of Revenue, Trivandrum, (1964) 4 SCR 280, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth, (1984) 4 SCC 27)
34. In J.K. Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., (1961) 3 SCR 185, this Court has clarified that not only does this rule of construction resolve the conflicts between the general provision in one statute and the special provision in another, it also finds utility in resolving a conflict between general and special provisions in the same legislative instrument too and observed that:

“9. …We reach the same result by applying another well known rule of construction that general provisions yield to special provisions. The learned Attorney-General seemed to suggest that while this rule of construction is applicable to resolve the conflict between the general provision in one Act and the special provision in another Act, the rule cannot apply in resolving a conflict between general and special provisions in the same legislative instrument. This suggestion does not find support in either principle or authority. The rule that general provisions should yield to specific provisions is not an arbitrary principle made by lawyers and Judges but springs from the common understanding of men and women that when the same person gives two directions one covering a large number of matters in general and another to only some of them his intention is that these latter directions should prevail as regards these while as regards all the rest the earlier direction should have effect. In Pretty v. Solly (quoted in Craies on Statute Law at p.m. 206, 6th Edn.) Romilly, M.R., mentioned the rule thus:
“The rule is, that whenever there is a particular enactment and a general enactment in the same statute and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply.” The rule has been applied as between different provisions of the same statute in numerous cases some of which only need be mentioned: De Winton v. Brecon, Churchill v. Crease, United States v. Chase and Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co.
10. Applying this rule of construction that in cases of conflict between a specific provision and a general provision the specific provision prevails over the general provision and the general provision applies only to such cases which are not covered by the special provision, we must hold that clause 5(a) has no application in a case where the special provisions of clause 23 are applicable.”
35. Lord Cooke of Thorndon pointed out, however, in Effort Shipping Co Ltd. v. Linden Management, SA [1998] AC 605 that the maxim is not a technical rule peculiar to English statutory interpretation, rather it ""represents simple common sense and ordinary usage"". Bennion, Statutory Interpretation, 5th ed. (2008), p. 1155 states that it is based, like other linguistic canons of construction, ""on the rules of logic, grammar, syntax and punctuation, and the use of language as a medium of communication generally. As Lord Wilberforce observed in Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd v Wyong Shire Council [1975] AC 538, 554, that it is still a matter of legislative intention, which the courts endeavour to extract from all available indications.

36. In Waverly Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Raymon & Co. (India) (P) Ltd., (1963) 3 SCR 209 and Union of India v. India Fisheries (P) Ltd., AIR 1966 SC 35 this Court has observed that when there is an apparent conflict between two independent provisions of law, the special provision must prevail. In CCE v. Jayant Oil Mills (P) Ltd., (1989) 3 SCC 343 this Court has accepted the aforesaid rule as “the basic rule of construction” that is to say “a more specific item should be preferred to one less so.” In Sarabjit Rick Singh v. Union of India, (2008) 2 SCC 417 this Court has in fact followed the aforesaid precedents thus:

“58. The Act is a special statute. It shall, therefore, prevail over the provisions of a general statute like the Code of Criminal Procedure.”
37. This Court has noticed the application of the said rule in construction of taxing statutes along with the proposition that the provisions must be given the most beneficial interpretation in CIT v. Shahzada Nand & Sons, (1966) 3 SCR 379:

“10. …The classic statement of Rowlatt, J., in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64, 71 still holds the field. It reads:
“In a Taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used.” To this may be added a rider: in a case of reasonable doubt, the construction most beneficial to the subject is to be adopted. But even so, the fundamental rule of construction is the same for all statutes, whether fiscal or otherwise. “The underlying principle is that the meaning and intention of a statute must be collected from the plain and unambiguous expression used therein rather than from any notions which may be entertained by the court as to what is just or expedient.” The expressed intention must guide the court. Another rule of construction which is relevant to the present enquiry is expressed in the maxim, generalia specialibus non derogant, which means that when there is a conflict between a general and a special provision, the latter shall prevail. The said principle has been stated in Craies on Statute Law, 5th Edn., at p. 205, thus:
“The rule is, that whenever there is a particular enactment and a general enactment in the same statute, and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply.” …When the words of a section are clear, but its scope is sought to be curtailed by construction, the approach suggested by Lord Coke in Heydon case, (1584) 3 Rep 7b, yield better results:
“To arrive at the real meaning, it is always necessary to get an exact conception of the aim, scope, and object of the whole Act: to consider, according to Lord Coke: (1) What was the law before the Act was passed; (2) What was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided; (3) What remedy Parliament has appointed; and (4) The reason of the remedy.”” (emphasis supplied)
38. In LIC v. D.J. Bahadur, (1981) 1 SCC 315 this Court was confronted with the question as to whether the LIC Act is a special legislation or a general legislation and while considering the rule in discussion, this Court observed thus:

“49. …the legal maxim generalia specialibus non derogant is ordinarily attracted where there is a conflict between a special and a general statute and an argument of implied repeal is raised. Craies states the law correctly:
“The general rule, that prior statutes are held to be repealed by implication by subsequent statutes if the two are repugnant, is said not to apply if the prior enactment is special and the subsequent enactment is general, the rule of law being, as stated by Lord Selbourne in Sewards v. Vera Cruz, ‘that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so. There is a well-known rule which has application to this case, which is that a subsequent general Act does not affect a prior special Act by implication. That this is the law cannot be doubted, and the cases on the subject will be found collected in the third edition of Maxwell is generalia specialibus non derogant — i.e. general provisions will not abrogate special provisions.’ When the legislature has given its attention to a separate subject and made provision for it, the presumption is that a subsequent general enactment is not intended to interfere with the special provision unless it manifests that intention very clearly. Each enactment must be construed in that respect according to its own subject-matter and its own terms.”
39. In Ashoka Marketing Ltd. v. Punjab National Bank, (1990) 4 SCC 406 this Court has placed reliance upon Bennion, Statutory Interpretation (supra) and J.K. Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills case (supra), amongst others, and explaining the rationale of this rule has reiterated the law as under:

“52. In U.P. State Electricity Board v. Hari Shanker Jain this Court has observed:
“In passing a special Act, Parliament devotes its entire consideration to a particular subject. When a general Act is subsequently passed, it is logical to presume that Parliament has not repealed or modified the former special Act unless it appears that the special Act again received consideration from Parliament.”
53. In Life Insurance Corporation v. D.J. Bahadur Krishna Iyer, J. has pointed out :
“In determining whether a statute is a special or a general one, the focus must be on the principal subject matter plus the particular perspective. For certain purposes, an Act may be general and for certain other purpose it may be special and we cannot blur distinctions when dealing with finer points of law.””
40. In U.P. SEB v. Hari Shankar Jain, (1978) 4 SCC 16, this Court has concluded that if Section 79(c) of the Electricity Supply Act generally provides for the making of regulations providing for the conditions of service of the employees of the Board, it can only be regarded as a general provision which must yield to the special provisions of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act in respect of matters covered by the latter Act, and observed that:

“9. The reason for the rule that a general provision should yield to a specific provision is this: In passing a special Act, Parliament devotes its entire consideration to a particular subject. When a general Act is subsequently passed, it is logical to presume that Parliament has not repealed or modified the former Special Act unless it appears that the Special Act again received consideration from Parliament. Vide London and Blackwall Railway v. Limehouse District Board of Works, and Thorpe v. Adams.
41. In Gobind Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Bihar, (1999) 7 SCC 76 this Court has observed that while determining the question whether a statute is a general or a special one, focus must be on the principal subject- matter coupled with a particular perspective with reference to the intendment of the Act. With this basic principle in mind, the provisions must be examined to find out whether it is possible to construe harmoniously the two provisions. If it is not possible then an effort will have to be made to ascertain whether the legislature had intended to accord a special treatment vis-à-vis the general entries and a further endeavour will have to be made to find out whether the specific provision excludes the applicability of the general ones. Once we come to the conclusion that intention of the legislation is to exclude the general provision then the rule “general provision should yield to special provision” is squarely attracted.

42. Having noticed the aforesaid, it could be concluded that the rule of statutory construction that the specific governs the general is not an absolute rule but is merely a strong indication of statutory meaning that can be overcome by textual indications that point in the other direction. This rule is particularly applicable where the legislature has enacted comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions. A subject specific provision relating to a specific, defined and descriptable subject is regarded as an exception to and would prevail over a general provision relating to a broad subject.

43. In the instant case, the item 1E is subject specific provision introduced by an amendment in 1996 to the Scheme. The said amendment removed “new cement industries” from the non-eligible Annexure-B and placed it into Annexure-C amongst the eligible industries. It classified the cement units for eligibility of tax exemption into three categories: small, medium and large. The said categories are comprehensive whereby small and medium cement units have been prescribed to have maximum FCIs of Rs.60/- lakhs and Rs.5/- crores, respectively and large to be over the FCI of Rs.5/- crores. The maximum ceiling for large cement units has been purposefully left open and thereby reflects that the intention clearly is to provide for an all-inclusive provision for new cement units so as to avoid any ambiguity in determination of appropriate provision for applicability to new cement units to seek exemption.

44. It leaves no doubt that what is specific has to be seen in contradistinction with the other items/entries. The provision more specific than the other on the same subject would prevail. Here it is subject specific item and therefore as against items 1, 4, 6 and 7, which deal with units of all industries and not only cement, item 1E restricted to only cement units would be a specific and special entry and thus would override the general provision.

45. The proposition put forth by the respondent-Company that the construction which is most beneficial to the assessee must be applied and adopted fails to impress upon us its application in this case. Howsoever, it is true that the canons of construction must be applied to extract most beneficial re-conciliation of provisions. In case of fiscal statute dealing with exemption, it would require interpretation benefiting the assessee. But here the introduction of the subject specific entry vide amendment into general scheme of exemption speaks volumes in respect of intention of the legislature to restrict the benefit to cement industries as available only under Item 1E, which categorically classified them into three as per their FCI. The specific entries being mutually exclusive have been placed so systematically arranged and classified in the Scheme. The construction of provisions must not be divorced from the object of introduction of subject specific provision while retaining other generalized provision that now specifically exclude the new cement industries, which could otherwise fall into its ambit, lest such interpretation would be not ab absurdo (i.e., interpretation avoiding absurd results).

46. Therefore, in our considered view the respondent-Company would only be eligible for grant of exemption under Item 1E as a large new cement unit in accordance with its FCI being above Rs.5/- crores. In light of the aforesaid, we are of the considered opinion that the judgment and order passed by the High Court ought to be set aside and the appeals of the Revenue requires to be allowed.

47. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside. No order as to costs.",1
Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and others,"The present appeal, by special leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 22.11.2012 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Appeal No. 2531 of 2012 whereby the Division Bench has affirmed the judgment and order dated 21.7.2011 in W.P. No. 25673 of 2007 whereunder the learned single Judge had allowed the writ petition, and after setting aside the punishment of dismissal, directed reinstatement of the respondent with continuity of service but without back wages.

3. Bereft of unnecessary details, the expose’ of facts that have been undraped are that the respondent was appointed as a Surveyor in Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (for short, “CMWSSB”) and subsequently promoted as Junior Engineer in 1989. From 28.8.1995 he remained continuously absent from duty without any intimation to the employer and did not respond to the repeated memoranda/reminders requiring him to explain his unauthorized absence from duty and to rejoin duty. On 1.4.1997 he reported to duty with the medical certificate for his absence from duty for the period commencing 28.8.1995 to 31.3.1997. As he had already remained unauthorisedly absent and did not respond to the memos by offering an explanation, a charge-sheet had already been issued on 11.9.1996 under the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations, 1978 (for brevity “the Regulations”). The charge memo contained two charges, namely, that the respondent-herein had failed to submit an explanation to the first charge memo dated 11.10.1995 inspite of reminders and second, he deserted his post by remaining unauthorisedly absent from duty from 28.8.1995, and thereby committed misconduct under Regulations 6(1) and 6(2) respectively of the Regulations. Be it noted, though the charge memo was duly acknowledged by the respondent on 19.11.1996, yet he chose not to submit his explanation till 6.1.1997, much after the charge- sheet was issued.

4. As the factual matrix would further uncurtain, an enquiry was conducted against the respondent and his explanation in the enquiry was that he could not attend to the duties and could not give explanation to the first charge memo because of ill health. The enquiry officer found charges were proved and, accordingly, submitted the enquiry report which was accepted by the disciplinary authority and after following the due procedure punishment of dismissal was passed on 16.4.1998. In the order of dismissal disciplinary authority observed that belated submission of medical certificate on 1.4.1997 irresistibly led to the conclusion that the respondent employee was unauthorisedly absent from 28.8.1995. A conclusion was also arrived at that the first charge, namely, that he had not responded to the letters and reminders, also stood proved. Being of this view, the disciplinary authority thought it apt to impose the punishment of dismissal from service and he did so.

5. On an appeal being preferred by the respondent the Board rejected the appeal dated 30.6.1998. Being dissatisfied by the order of dismissal and the affirmation thereof in appeal, the respondent preferred W.P. No. 15272 of 1998. The learned Single Judge, by order dated 12.3.2003, directed re-consideration of the appeal solely on the ground that the Managing Director who was the disciplinary authority had taken part in the proceedings of the Board which decided the appeal. After the said order came to be passed, the matter was again placed before the Board and the appellate authority, considering the enquiry report, the evidence brought on record and after due discussion, affirmed the order of disciplinary authority and consequently dismissed the appeal on 1.7.2003.

6. The grievance of re-affirmation of the order of dismissal was agitated by the respondent in W.P. No. 25673 of 2007 which was preferred on 7.7.2007. The appellant-Board in the counter affidavit, defending the order of dismissal, stated that the only reason given by the employee was that he could not attend the duties as he was availing continuous treatment for tuberculosis and, further, he also met with an accident in September 1995 which was unacceptable. In addition, it was stated in the counter affidavit that bunch of medical certificates was produced by him on 1.4.1997 which mentioned that he was suffering from depressive psychosis and bronchitis and there was no mention about any accident and injury sustained by him in September 1995 and treatment availed by him.

7. The learned Single Judge, by the impugned judgment, after narrating the facts, noted the statement of the learned counsel for the respondent that even if the employee had absented from duty, there was no past misconduct of desertion/absence and, therefore, the punishment of dismissal from service for the first time desertion/absenteeism is too harsh and disproportionate and deserved to be interfered with. The learned Single Judge did not advert to any other facet and referred to the decisions in Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya v. Commissioner of Police, Delhi[1], B. C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India[2], V. Ramana v. A.P. SRTC[3], Jagdish Singh v. Punjab Engineering College[4] and Division Bench judgment in V. Senthurvelan v. High Court of Judicature at Madras[5] and opined thus:-

“10. Applying the said judgment to the fact of this case and considering the counter filed by the respondents wherein it is not stated as to whether the petitioner has deserted / absented on any previous occasion, this Court is of the view that this writ petition deserves to be allowed.

11. This writ petition is allowed with a direction to the respondent to reinstate petitioner with continuity of service but without backwage, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.”

8. Grieved by the aforesaid order the CMWSSB preferred Writ Appeal No. 2531 of 2012 and the Division Bench accepted the conclusion of the learned single Judge by stating thus: -

“It is not in dispute that the respondent/ writ petitioner was unwell during the said period, though there might have been some discrepancies in the date of the certificate issued, it has not been controverted by the appellant that the respondent/writ petitioner was suffering from depressive psychosis and bronchitis. That apart it has also not been disputed that the respondent/ writ petitioner had not suffered any earlier punishment while in the services of the appellant Board from the date of his appointment. Therefore, in such circumstances, it would be very harsh and unreasonable to impose the punishment of removal from service for the charge of unauthorized absence, as such punishment is awarded for acts of grave nature or as cumulative effect of continued misconduct or for such other reasons, where the charges are very serious and in case where charge of corruption had been proved. Admittedly, there has been no such allegation against the respondent/writ petitioner. Further, the learned single Judge while setting aside the order of dismissal from service, rightly denied back wages to the respondent/writ petitioner as the respondent/writ petitioner failed to discharge duty during the relevant period.” [Underlining is ours]

9. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material brought on record.

10. On a keen scrutiny of the decision rendered by the learned single Judge as well as that of the Division Bench it is clearly demonstrable that there has been no advertence with regard to the issue whether the charges levelled against the respondent had been proved or not. It is manifest that there had been no argument on the said score before the writ court or in intra- court appeal and hence, we are obliged to state that the only aspect which was really proponed before the High Court pertains to the nature of charges and proportionality of punishment. Therefore, we shall confine our analysis with regard to said limited sphere and an added facet which the learned counsel for the appellant has emphatically urged before us, that is, the belated approach by the respondent in invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court.

11. The charges that were levelled against the respondent-employee read as follows: -

“CHARGE NO. 1:

That he has failed to offer his explanation to this office Memo dated 11.10.95 in spite of reminders thereon dated 20.01.96 and 23.04.96 which clearly shows his disobedience to the order of superior and it amounts to misconduct under Regulation 6(1) of the MMWSS Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations 1978.

CHARGE NO. 2:

That he has deserted the post from 28.08.95 onwards and remains unauthorisedly absent from duty which amounts to misconduct under Regulation 6(2) of the MMWSS Board Employees (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations 1978.”

12. It is not in dispute that the Inquiry Officer found that both the charges had been proved. The disciplinary authority had ascribed reasons and passed an order of dismissal from service. On a perusal of the order of dismissal it is vivid that the medical certificate was belatedly submitted and he had remained unauthorisedly absent from 28.08.1995. The question that arises is when the charges of unauthorized absence for a long period had been proven, was it justified on the part of the High Court to take resort to the doctrine of proportionality and direct reinstatement in service. That apart, one aspect which has not at all been addressed to by the High Court is that the respondent invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court after four years.

13. First, we shall deal with the facet of delay. In Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation v. Balwant Regular Motor Service, Amravati and others[6] the Court referred to the principle that has been stated by Sir Barnes Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd, Abram Farewall, and John Kemp[7], which is as follows: -

“Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.”

14. In State of Maharashtra v. Digambar[8], while dealing with exercise of power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, the Court observed that power of the High Court to be exercised under Article 226 of the Constitution, if is discretionary, its exercise must be judicious and reasonable, admits of no controversy. It is for that reason, a person’s entitlement for relief from a High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, be it against the State or anybody else, even if is founded on the allegation of infringement of his legal right, has to necessarily depend upon unblameworthy conduct of the person seeking relief, and the court refuses to grant the discretionary relief to such person in exercise of such power, when he approaches it with unclean hands or blameworthy conduct.

15. In State of M.P. and others etc. etc. v. Nandlal Jaiswal and others etc. etc.[9] the Court observed that it is well settled that power of the High Court to issue an appropriate writ under Article 226 of the Constitution is discretionary and the High Court in exercise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. It has been further stated therein that if there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in filing a petition and such delay is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may decline to intervene and grant relief in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. Emphasis was laid on the principle of delay and laches stating that resort to the extraordinary remedy under the writ jurisdiction at a belated stage is likely to cause confusion and public inconvenience and bring in injustice.

16. Thus, the doctrine of delay and laches should not be lightly brushed aside. A writ court is required to weigh the explanation offered and the acceptability of the same. The court should bear in mind that it is exercising an extraordinary and equitable jurisdiction. As a constitutional court it has a duty to protect the rights of the citizens but simultaneously it is to keep itself alive to the primary principle that when an aggrieved person, without adequate reason, approaches the court at his own leisure or pleasure, the Court would be under legal obligation to scrutinize whether the lis at a belated stage should be entertained or not. Be it noted, delay comes in the way of equity. In certain circumstances delay and laches may not be fatal but in most circumstances inordinate delay would only invite disaster for the litigant who knocks at the doors of the Court. Delay reflects inactivity and inaction on the part of a litigant – a litigant who has forgotten the basic norms, namely, “procrastination is the greatest thief of time” and second, law does not permit one to sleep and rise like a phoenix. Delay does bring in hazard and causes injury to the lis. In the case at hand, though there has been four years’ delay in approaching the court, yet the writ court chose not to address the same. It is the duty of the court to scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be ignored without any justification. That apart, in the present case, such belated approach gains more significance as the respondent-employee being absolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a lackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remained unauthorisedly absent on the pretext of some kind of ill health. We repeat at the cost of repetition that remaining innocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the cause of justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for it is likely to affect others. Such delay may have impact on others’ ripened rights and may unnecessarily drag others into litigation which in acceptable realm of probability, may have been treated to have attained finality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such indolent persons - who compete with ‘Kumbhakarna’ or for that matter ‘Rip Van Winkle’. In our considered opinion, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and on the said ground alone the writ court should have thrown the petition overboard at the very threshold.

17. Having dealt with the doctrine of delay and laches, we shall presently proceed to deal with the doctrine of proportionality which has been taken recourse to by the High Court regard being had to the obtaining factual matrix. We think it appropriate to refer to some of the authorities which have been placed reliance upon by the High Court.

18. In Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya (supra) this Court opined that the unauthorized absence was not a grave misconduct inasmuch as the employee had proceeded on leave under compulsion because of his grave condition of health. Be it noted, in the said case, it has also been observed that no reasonable disciplinary authority would term absence on medical grounds with proper medical certificate from Government doctors as a grave misconduct.

19. In Jagdish Singh (supra) the Court took note of the fact that the appellant therein was a sweeper and had remained absent on four spells totalling to fifteen days in all in two months. In that context, the Court observed thus: -

“The instant case is not a case of habitual absenteeism. The appellant seems to have a good track record from the date he joined service as a sweeper. In his long career of service, he remained absent for fifteen days on four occasions in the months of February and March 2004. This was primarily to sort out the problem of his daughter with her in-laws. The filial bondage and the emotional attachment might have come in his way to apply and obtain leave from the employer. The misconduct that is alleged, in our view, would definitely amount to violation of discipline that is expected of an employee to maintain in the establishment, but may not fit into the category of gross violation of discipline. We hasten to add, if it were to be habitual absenteeism, we would not have ventured to entertain this appeal.”

20. If both the decisions are appositely understood, two aspects clearly emerge. In Shri Bhagwan Lal Arya (supra), the Court took note of the fact, that is, production of proper medical certificate from a Government medical doctor and opined about the nature of misconduct and in Jagdish Singh (supra) the period of absence, status of the employee and his track record and the explanation offered by him. In the case at hand, the factual score being different, to which we shall later on advert, the aforesaid authorities do not really assist the respondent.

21. Learned counsel for the respondent has commended us to the decision in Krushnakant B. Parmar v. Union of India and another[10] to highlight that in the absence of a finding returned by the Inquiry Officer or determination by the disciplinary authority that the unauthorized absence was willful, the charge could not be treated to have been proved. To appreciate the said submission we have carefully perused the said authority. In the said case, the question arose whether “unauthorized absence from duty” did tantamount to “failure of devotion to duty” or “behavior unbecoming of a Government servant” inasmuch as the appellant therein was charge-sheeted for failure to maintain devotion to duty and his behavior was unbecoming of a Government servant. After adverting to the rule position the two-Judge Bench expressed thus: -

“16. In the case of the appellant referring to unauthorized absence the disciplinary authority alleged that he failed to maintain devotion to duty and his behavior was unbecoming of a government servant. The question whether “unauthorized absence from duty” amounts to failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a government servant cannot be decided without deciding the question whether absence is willful or because of compelling circumstances.

17. If the absence is the result of compelling circumstances under which it was not possible to report or perform duty, such absence cannot be held to be willful. Absence from duty without any application or prior permission may amount to unauthorized absence, but it does not always mean willful. There may be different eventualities due to which an employee may abstain from duty, including compelling circumstances beyond his control like illness, accident, hospitalization, etc., but in such case the employee cannot be held guilty of failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a government servant.

18. In a departmental proceeding, if allegation of unauthorized absence from duty is made, the disciplinary authority is required to prove that the absence is willful, in the absence of such finding, the absence will not amount to misconduct.”

22. We have quoted in extenso as we are disposed to think that the Court has, while dealing with the charge of failure of devotion to duty or behavior unbecoming of a Government servant, expressed the aforestated view and further the learned Judges have also opined that there may be compelling circumstances which are beyond the control of an employee. That apart, the facts in the said case were different as the appellant on certain occasions was prevented to sign the attendance register and the absence was intermittent. Quite apart from that, it has been stated therein that it is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to come to a conclusion that the absence is willful. On an apposite understanding of the judgment we are of the opinion that the view expressed in the said case has to be restricted to the facts of the said case regard being had to the rule position, the nature of the charge levelled against the employee and the material that had come on record during the enquiry. It cannot be stated as an absolute proposition in law that whenever there is a long unauthorized absence, it is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to record a finding that the said absence is willful even if the employee fails to show the compelling circumstances to remain absent.

23. In this context, it is seemly to refer to certain other authorities relating to unauthorized absence and the view expressed by this Court. In State of Punjab v. Dr. P.L. Singla[11] the Court, dealing with unauthorized absence, has stated thus: -

“Unauthorised absence (or overstaying leave), is an act of indiscipline. Whenever there is an unauthorized absence by an employee, two courses are open to the employer. The first is to condone the unauthorized absence by accepting the explanation and sanctioning leave for the period of the unauthorized absence in which event the misconduct stood condoned. The second is to treat the unauthorized absence as a misconduct, hold an enquiry and impose a punishment for the misconduct.”

24. Again, while dealing with the concept of punishment the Court ruled as follows: -

“Where the employee who is unauthorisedly absent does not report back to duty and offer any satisfactory explanation, or where the explanation offered by the employee is not satisfactory, the employer will take recourse to disciplinary action in regard to the unauthorized absence. Such disciplinary proceedings may lead to imposition of punishment ranging from a major penalty like dismissal or removal from service to a minor penalty like withholding of increments without cumulative effect. The extent of penalty will depend upon the nature of service, the position held by the employee, the period of absence and the cause/explanation for the absence.”

25. In Tushar D. Bhatt v. State of Gujarat and another[12], the appellant therein had remained unauthorisedly absent for a period of six months and further had also written threatening letters and conducted some other acts of misconduct. Eventually, the employee was visited with order of dismissal and the High Court had given the stamp of approval to the same. Commenting on the conduct of the appellant the Court stated that he was not justified in remaining unauthorisedly absent from official duty for more than six months because in the interest of discipline of any institution or organization such an approach and attitude of the employee cannot be countenanced.

26. Thus, the unauthorized absence by an employee, as a misconduct, cannot be put into a straight-jacket formula for imposition of punishment. It will depend upon many a factor as has been laid down in Dr. P.L. Singla (supra).

27. Presently, we shall proceed to scrutinize whether the High Court is justified in applying the doctrine of proportionality. Doctrine of proportionality in the context of imposition of punishment in service law gets attracted when the court on the analysis of material brought on record comes to the conclusion that the punishment imposed by the Disciplinary Authority or the appellate authority shocks the conscience of the court. In this regard a passage from Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and another v. Ashok Kumar Arora[13] is worth reproducing: -

“At the outset, it needs to be mentioned that the High Court in such cases of departmental enquiries and the findings recorded therein does not exercise the powers of appellate court/authority. The jurisdiction of the High Court in such cases is very limited for instance where it is found that the domestic enquiry is vitiated because of non-observance of principles of natural justice, denial of reasonable opportunity; findings are based on no evidence, and/or the punishment is totally disproportionate to the proved misconduct of an employee.”

28. In Union of India and another v. G. Ganayutham[14], the Court analysed the conception of proportionality in administrative law in England and India and thereafter addressed itself with regard to the punishment in disciplinary matters and opined that unless the court/tribunal opines in its secondary role that the administrator was, on the material before him, irrational according to Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn.[15] and Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil Service[16] norms, the punishment cannot be quashed.

29. In Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Coal India Limited and another v. Mukul Kumar Choudhuri and others[17], the Court, after analyzing the doctrine of proportionality at length, ruled thus: -

“19. The doctrine of proportionality is, thus, well-recognised concept of judicial review in our jurisprudence. What is otherwise within the discretionary domain and sole power of the decision-maker to quantify punishment once the charge of misconduct stands proved, such discretionary power is exposed to judicial intervention if exercised in a manner which is out of proportion to the fault. Award of punishment which is grossly in excess to the allegations cannot claim immunity and remains open for interference under limited scope of judicial review.

20. One of the tests to be applied while dealing with the question of quantum of punishment would be: would any reasonable employer have imposed such punishment in like circumstances? Obviously, a reasonable employer is expected to take into consideration measure, magnitude and degree of misconduct and all other relevant circumstances and exclude irrelevant matters before imposing punishment.

21. In a case like the present one where the misconduct of the delinquent was unauthorized absence from duty for six months but upon being charged of such misconduct, he fairly admitted his guilt and explained the reason for his absence by stating that he did not have intention nor desired to disobey the order of higher authority or violate any of the Company’s rules and regulations but the reason was purely personal and beyond his control and, as a matter of fact, he sent his resignation which was not accepted, the order of removal cannot be held to be justified, since in our judgment, no reasonable employer would have imposed extreme punishment of removal in like circumstances. The punishment is not only unduly harsh but grossly in excess to the allegations.”

30. After so stating the two-Judge Bench proceeded to say that one of the tests to be applied while dealing with the question of quantum of punishment is whether any reasonable employer would have imposed such punishment in like circumstances taking into consideration the major, magnitude and degree of misconduct and all other relevant circumstances after excluding irrelevant matters before imposing punishment. It is apt to note here that in the said case the respondent had remained unauthorisedly absent from duty for six months and admitted his guilt and explained the reasons for his absence by stating that he neither had any intention nor desire to disobey the order of superior authority or violated any of the rules or regulations but the reason was purely personal and beyond his control. Regard being had to the obtaining factual matrix, the Court interfered with the punishment on the ground of proportionality. The facts in the present case are quite different. As has been seen from the analysis made by the High Court, it has given emphasis on past misconduct of absence and first time desertion and thereafter proceeded to apply the doctrine of proportionality. The aforesaid approach is obviously incorrect. It is telltale that the respondent had remained absent for a considerable length of time. He had exhibited adamantine attitude in not responding to the communications from the employer while he was unauthorisedly absent. As it appears, he has chosen his way, possibly nurturing the idea that he can remain absent for any length of time, apply for grant of leave at any time and also knock at the doors of the court at his own will. Learned counsel for the respondent has endeavoured hard to impress upon us that he had not been a habitual absentee. We really fail to fathom the said submission when the respondent had remained absent for almost one year and seven months. The plea of absence of “habitual absenteeism” is absolutely unacceptable and, under the obtaining circumstances, does not commend acceptation. We are disposed to think that the respondent by remaining unauthorisedly absent for such a long period with inadequate reason had not only shown indiscipline but also made an attempt to get away with it. Such a conduct is not permissible and we are inclined to think that the High Court has erroneously placed reliance on the authorities where this Court had interfered with the punishment. We have no shadow of doubt that the doctrine of proportionality does not get remotely attracted to such a case. The punishment is definitely not shockingly disproportionate.

31. Another aspect needs to be noted. The respondent was a Junior Engineer. Regard being had to his official position, it was expected of him to maintain discipline, act with responsibility, perform his duty with sincerity and serve the institution with honesty. This kind of conduct cannot be countenanced as it creates a concavity in the work culture and ushers in indiscipline in an organization. In this context, we may fruitfully quote a passage from Government of India and another v. George Philip[18]: -

“In a case involving overstay of leave and absence from duty, granting six months’ time to join duty amounts to not only giving premium to indiscipline but is wholly subversive of the work culture in the organization. Article 51-A(j) of the Constitution lays down that it shall be the duty of every citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. This cannot be achieved unless the employees maintain discipline and devotion to duty. Courts should not pass such orders which instead of achieving the underlying spirit and objects of Part IV-A of the Constitution have the tendency to negate or destroy the same.”

32. We respectfully reiterate the said feeling and re-state with the hope that employees in any organization should adhere to discipline for not only achieving personal excellence but for collective good of an organization. When we say this, we may not be understood to have stated that the employers should be harsh to impose grave punishment on any misconduct. An amiable atmosphere in an organization develops the work culture and the employer and the employees are expected to remember the same as a precious value for systemic development.

33. Judged on the anvil of the aforesaid premises, the irresistible conclusion is that the interference by the High Court with the punishment is totally unwarranted and unsustainable, and further the High Court was wholly unjustified in entertaining the writ petition after a lapse of four years. The result of aforesaid analysis would entail overturning the judgments and orders passed by the learned single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court and, accordingly, we so do.

34. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the judgments and orders passed by the High Court are set aside leaving the parties to bear their respective costs",1
Voltas Limited,"Regard being had to the similitude of controversy in both the appeals they were heard together and are disposed of by a common judgment. Be it noted, the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, by two separate judgments and orders passed on 16.8.2013 in Appeals Nos. 7 of 2013 and 8 of 2013 has set aside the judgment and order dated 1.10.2012 passed by the learned single Judge in Arbitration Petition (L) Nos. 1239 of 2012 and 1240 of 2012 respectively as a consequence of which two interim awards passed by the learned Arbitrator on 26.7.2012 in respect of two contracts between the same parties rejecting the counter claim of the respondent-herein have been annulled. For the sake of clarity and convenience we shall state the facts from Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 30015 of 2013, for the Division Bench has observed that the Appeal No. 7 of 2013 had emanated from the disputes which arose in respect of civil construction agreement dated 2.2.2001 and in Appeal No. 8 of 2013 the disputes related to agreement dated 8.1.2003 for air-conditioning of the two buildings to be constructed for the appellant therein and no separate submissions were advanced before it and the position was the same before the learned single Judge.

3. The expose’ of facts are that the appellant and respondent entered into a civil construction contract for construction of two buildings known as Rolta Bhawan II (RB-II) and Rolta Bhawan III (RB-II) and also for modification of building Rolta Bhawan I(RB-I) previously constructed by the respondent. As certain disputes arose, on 3.12.2004 the respondent terminated the contract. After certain correspondences between the parties pertaining to the termination of the contract the appellant by letter dated 29.3.2006 invoked the arbitration clause in respect of its claims against the respondent. As the respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator, it filed an application under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short “the Act”) before the High Court of Bombay for appointment of arbitrator and the designated Judge vide order dated 19.11.2010 appointed the sole arbitrator.

4. After the controversy came in seisin before the learned Arbitrator, he issued certain directions and, as the facts would unfurl, the appellant filed its statement of claim on 13.4.2011 claiming a sum of Rs.23,31,62,429.77 together with interest at the rate of 15% per annum from the respondent. The respondent, after filing its defence on 24.8.2011, filed the counter claim of Rs.333,73,35,026/- together with interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of filing till payment/realization thereof. In the counter claim the respondent justified the termination of the agreement and contended that it was entitled to damages for breach of contract. In the counter claim the notice dated 17.4.2006 sent by the respondent detailing its counter claim to the appellant was referred to.

5. After the counter claim was lodged, the appellant-herein filed its objections about the tenability of the counter claim stating that the same was not maintainable and was also barred by limitation. The learned Arbitrator on 7.1.2012 framed two issues regarding the tenability and limitation of the counter claim as preliminary issues. They are: -

“(i) Whether the counter claim, or a substantial part thereof, is barred by the law of limitation?

(ii) Whether the counter claim is not maintainable and beyond the scope of reference?”

6. After adumbrating to the facts the learned Arbitrator came to hold that the limitation for making a counter claim is required to be asserted with reference to the date on which the cause of action arises and the date on which the counter claim is filed. After so opining the learned Arbitrator recorded as follows: -

“The respondent has been vigilant and assertive of its legal rights right from 3rd December 2004 on which date the Contract was terminated. The assertions in the letters dated 27th April 2005 and 29th March 2006 show unmistakable consciousness of its rights on the part of the Respondent. The last letter dated 29th March 2006 is the notice of the Advocates of the Respondent asserting its right to invoke arbitration. The Tribunal is of the view that cause of action for the Counter-claim which must be treated as an independent action to be instituted, really arose latest by 29th March 2008, if not earlier it is clear that the Counter claim is filed only on 26th September, 2011 and as such it is beyond the period of limitation of three years.” It may be noted here that the learned Arbitrator, however, overruled the objection with regard to the maintainability of the counter claim being beyond the scope of reference.

7. After the interim award was passed by the learned Arbitrator, the respondent filed an application under Section 34 of the Act for setting aside the decision of the learned Arbitrator rejecting the counter claims made by it on the ground of limitation. The learned single Judge, after adverting to the facts in detail and the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties, referred to certain authorities, namely, Ispat Industries Limited v. Shipping Corporation of India Limited[1] and State of Goa v. Praveen Enterprises[2], and came to hold that the arbitral proceedings in respect of those disputes commenced on the date on which the request for the said disputes to be referred to arbitration was received by the respondent, and further that only such disputes which were referred to in the notice invoking arbitration agreement with a request to refer the same to arbitration, the arbitral proceedings commenced and it would not apply to the counter claim. Thereafter the learned single Judge proceeded to state as follows: -

“When the notice was given by the respondent on 29th March, 2006, the said notice was only in respect of the disputes having arisen between the parties due to refusal of claims made by the petitioner. On the date of issuance of such notice, the petitioner had not even asserted its claim. After issuance of such notice on 29th March, 2006, the petitioner by its letter dated 17th April, 2006 had asserted its claim for the first time. The dispute in respect of the counter claim raised when the petitioner did not pay the said amount as demanded. Such disputes thus did not exist when the notice invoking arbitration agreement was given by the respondent on 29th March, 2006. In my view, the arbitral proceedings therefore, cannot be said to have commenced in respect of the counter claim when the notice was given by the respondent on 29th March, 2006. The counter claim was admittedly filed on 26th September, 2011 which was made beyond the period of limitation. The arbitral proceedings commenced in respect of the counter claim only when the said counter claim was lodged by the petitioner on 26th September, 2011. Even if the date of refusal on the part of the respondent, to pay the amount as demanded by the petitioner by its notice dated 17th April, 2006 is considered as commencement of dispute, even in such case on the date of filing the counter claim i.e. 26th September, 2011, the counter claim was barred by law of limitation. In my view, thus the tribunal was justified in rejecting the counter claim filed by the petitioner as time barred.”

8. After so stating the learned single Judge held that the opinion expressed by the learned Arbitrator was not perverse and based on correct appreciation of documents and was resultant of a plausible interpretation and accordingly rejected the application preferred under Section 34 of the Act.

9. Being dissatisfied, the respondent-herein preferred an appeal before the Division Bench which chronologically referred to the correspondences made between the parties, the reasoning ascribed by the learned Arbitrator, the submissions propounded before it, the principles stated in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd.[3] as regards the jurisdiction of the Court while dealing with an application under Section 34 of the Act, the concept of limitation as has been explained in Praveen Enterprises (supra), the demand made by the appellant therein by letter dated 17.4.2006 quantifying a sum of Rs.68.63 crores, exclusion of period between 3.5.2006 to 19.11.2010 during which period the application under Section 11 of the Act was pending before the High Court and on that foundation, in the ultimate eventuate, came to hold that the counter claim filed on 26.9.2011 was within limitation. The aforesaid view obliged the Division Bench to allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge as a consequence thereof the rejection of the counter claim by the learned Arbitrator stood overturned. Be it noted, rest of the interim award of the learned Arbitrator was not disturbed.

10. Assailing the legal substantiality of the view expressed by the Division Bench, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant, has raised the following contentions: -

i) Existence of dispute is fundamentally essential for a controversy to be arbitrated upon and in the case at hand there being no dispute raised by the respondent as warranted in law, the counter claim put forth before the learned Arbitrator deserved to be thrown at the threshold and the High Court would have been well advised to do so.

ii) The limitation for a counter claim has to be strictly in accordance with Section 43(1) of the Act read with Section 3(2)(b) of the Limitation Act, 1963 and any deviation therefrom is required to be authorized by any other provision of law. The only other provision of law which can depart from Section 43(1) of the Act read with Section 3(2)(b) of the Limitation Act, is the provision contained in Section 21 of the Act, where the respondent to the claimant’s claim invokes arbitration in regard to specific or particular disputes and further makes a request for the said disputes to be referred to arbitration and in that event alone, the date of filing of the counter claim would not be the relevant date but the date of making such request for arbitration would be the date for computing limitation. The Division Bench has not kept itself alive to the requisite twin tests and has erroneously ruled that the counter claim as filed by the respondent is not barred by limitation.

(iii) The principle stated in Praveen Enterprises’s case is not applicable to the present case because the correspondences made by the respondent, including the letter dated 17.4.2006, show that there had neither been any enumeration of specific claims nor invocation of the arbitration clause but merely computation of certain claims, though for application of the exception as carved out in Praveen Enterprises (supra), both the conditions precedent, namely, making out a specific claim and invocation of arbitration are to be satisfied.

(iv) The exclusion of the period during pendency of the application under Section 11 of the Act, as has been held by the Division Bench, is wholly contrary to the principle laid down in paragraphs 20 and 32 in Praveen Enterprises (supra).

(v) Assuming the principle stated in Praveen Enterprises (supra) is made applicable, the claims asserted by the respondent in its letter dated 17.4.2006 could only be saved being not hit by limitation and not the exaggerated counter claim that has been filed before the learned Arbitrator.

(vi) The Division Bench completely erred in interfering with the interim award in exercise of power under Section 34 of the Act, though the principle stated in Saw Pipes Ltd. (supra) is not attracted and further that the recording of finding that the award passed by the learned Arbitrator suffers from perversity of approach is not acceptable inasmuch as a possible and plausible interpretation of the contract and documents has been made which is within the domain of the learned Arbitrator as has been stated in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran[4].

11. Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent, defending the impugned judgment, has proponed the following: -

a) The documents brought on record demonstrably establish that dispute existed between the parties as regards the counter claim and hence, the submission raised on behalf of the appellant on that score is sans substance.

b) The Division Bench has rightly come to hold that the counter claim filed by the respondent-herein was within time on the basis of the law laid down in Praveen Enterprises (supra) inasmuch as the date of filing of the counter claim has to relate back to the date of claim made by the respondent and the correspondences between the parties do clearly show that the respondent had raised its claim and also sought for arbitration in a legally accepted manner.

c) The alternative submission that the counter claim has to be confined to the amount quantified in the letter dated 17.4.2006 is unacceptable in law, for in Praveen Enterprises (supra) it has been held that the statement of claim need not be restricted to the claims in the notice and on that base it can safely be concluded that the said proposition holds good for counter claims as well. That apart, the principle also gets support from what has been laid down in McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and others[5].

12. First, we shall address to the submissions pertaining to existence and raising of dispute as regards the counter claim. We are required to deal with the same in the case at hand since Mr. Venugopal, learned senior counsel, has urged that if no dispute was raised at any point of time, it could not have been raised before the learned Arbitrator as it would be clearly hit by limitation. Learned senior counsel has placed reliance on Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi v. Delhi Development Authority[6] and Jammu and Kashmir State Forest Corporation v. Abdul Karim Wani and others[7], to bolster the submission that in the case at hand the disputes as regards the counter claim really had not arisen, for mere assertions and denials do not constitute a dispute capable of reference to arbitration and hence, not to be entertained when it is dead or stale.

13. In Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi (supra) the High Court had rejected the petition preferred under Section 20 of Arbitration Act, 1940 as barred by limitation. The two-Judge Bench referred to Section 20 of the 1940 Act and opined that in order to be entitled to order of reference under Section 20, it is necessary that there should be an arbitration agreement and secondly, dispute must arise to which the agreement applied. In the said case, there had been an assertion of claim of the appellant and silence as well as refusal in respect of the same by the respondent. The Court observed that a dispute had arisen regarding non- payment of the alleged dues to the appellant and, in that context, observed thus: -

“A dispute arises where there is a claim and a denial and repudiation of the claim. The existence of dispute is essential for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 8 or a reference under Section 20 of the Act. See Law of Arbitration by R.S. Bachawat, first edition, page

354. There should be dispute and there can only be a dispute when a claim is asserted by one party and denied by the other on whatever grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does not lead to the inference of the existence of dispute. Dispute entails a positive element and assertion of denying, not merely inaction to accede to a claim or a request. Whether in a particular case a dispute has arisen or not has to be found out from the facts and circumstances of the case.”

14. In Abdul Karim Wani and others (supra) the question arose whether the dispute mentioned in the contractor’s application could have been referred to the arbitration at all. The majority came to hold that the claim raised by the plaintiff in his application was not covered by the arbitration clause and, therefore, was not permissible to be referred for a decision to the arbitrator. Be it noted, in the said case, the work under the contract had already been executed without any dispute. The majority also observed that in the absence of a repudiation by the Corporation of the respondent’s right to be considered, if and when occasion arises, no dispute could be referred for arbitration. It further ruled that in order that there may be a reference to arbitration, existence of a dispute is essential and the dispute to be referred to arbitration must arise under the arbitration agreement.

15. The principles laid down in the aforesaid cases were under the 1940 Act at the stage of appointment of arbitrator. In the case at hand, though we are dealing with a lis under the 1996 Act, yet we are to deal with the said facet as the learned Arbitrator has passed an interim award as regards the sustenance of the counter claim. In this regard, it is necessary to refer to the correspondences entered into between the parties and to appreciate the effect and impact of such communications. By letter dated 1.3.2005 the appellant, while referring to the letter dated 3.12.2004 issued by the respondent terminating the contract on the ground of alleged delay and default in completion of the project, without prejudice had made a request for payment of final bill in full and settle the claim made therein at the earliest. It was also suggested therein that if the respondent needed any additional information or material in support of the claim put forth, the appellant would furnish the same. On 18.3.2005 the respondent communicated to the appellant through its counsel that it would compute its losses, damages, costs, charges, expenses, etc. after the building work was over and claim the same from the appellant. The appellant vide letter dated 7.4.2005, through its counsel, intimated the respondent that it was not liable to pay any alleged losses, damages, costs, charges and expenses, allegedly suffered by the respondent. On 27.4.2005 by another communication an assertion was made about the losses suffered by the respondent. The respondent asseverated that it was not liable to pay to the appellant any compensation and damages or other amounts as claimed in the letter dated 1.3.2005 to the respondent. In fact, the respondent was compelled to terminate the civil contractor as per the recommendation of the Architects, M/s. Master & Associates, and the respondent had suffered huge losses and damages and had incurred heavy costs, charges and expenses for which the appellant was solely respondible. It was also mentioned in the letter that the respondent reserved its right to take appropriate steps against the appellant as per the agreement entered into between the parties as per law. As the factual exposition would unfurl, on 29.3.2006 the appellant, referring to its earlier communications dated 14.4.2004, 23.4.2004, 24.5.2004, 18.6.2004, 13.7.2004 and 1.3.2005, claimed for appointment of an arbitrator. On 17.4.2006 the respondent specified the claims under various heads and also claimed payment to be made within seven days failing which it will invoke the arbitration clause. To the said communication and another communication dated 21.4.2006 we shall refer to at a later stage while dealing with the other facet of submission. It may be noted here that on 9.5.2006 the appellant, referring to letter dated 17.4.2006 whereby the respondent had raised its claims, stated as follows: -

“Our clients deny that the claim made against you is false and frivolous. Our clients deny that any amount is due to you for the alleged breach of the aforesaid contract. Our clients deny that they have committed any breach of the aforesaid contract.

xxx xxx xxx In view of what is stated hereinabove, our clients deny that they are liable to pay to you a sum of Rs.68,63,72,743.08 or any other sum.”

16. Thus, the correspondences between the parties make it vivid that the claims made by the respondent were denied by the appellant on many a ground and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to say that there was inaction or mere denial. Therefore, in the obtaining fact situation, the principles stated in Major (Retd.) Inder Singh Rekhi (supra) and Abdul Karim Wani and others (supra) are not applicable.

17. The next aspect that has been highlighted by Mr. Venugopal is that the respondent had never, in the true sense of the term, invoked arbitration by appropriately putting forth specified claims. In this context, we may refer to the letter dated 29.3.2006 which would show that the appellant had asserted that the disputes and differences had arisen between the parties to the agreement and invoked the arbitration clause calling upon the respondent to appoint an independent unbiased arbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of the said notice, failing which they would be constrained to approach the designated Judge of the Chief Justice of Bombay High Court for appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Act. The respondent, vide letter dated 17.4.2006, sent through its counsel while stating that it was surprised to receive the demand made by the appellant with regard to the final R.A. bill dated 21.12.2004, clearly stated that the earlier letter dated 1.3.2005 had already been replied to vide letter dated 18.3.2005. In the said letter it was mentioned by the respondent that it had crystallized its claim amounting to Rs.68,63,72,743.08 and, be it noted, the said claim was made on various heads by the respondent. Reproduction of part of the said letter would be apposite: -

“The final R.A. Bill sent by you is incorrect in many respects; one of them being that you have made claims based on works actually not done by you Nothing is due and payable by us to you against your final R.A. Bill. We call upon you to pay to us the aforesaid sum of Rs.68,63,72,743.08 within seven days of the receipt of this letter, failing which you will be liable to pay interest at the rate of 18% p.a. on expiry of seven days after receipt of this letter by you, till payment and/or realization. Please note that if the aforesaid payment is not made within seven days of the receipt of this letter, we will invoke the arbitration clause of the civil contract and refer the disputes to arbitration.”

18. In this regard reference to letter dated 21.4.2006 written by the appellant is seemly. The relevant part of the said letter is as follows:

-

“We are instructed to inform you that our client was out of India in connection with the business tour and returned to India on 19th April, 2006. Our client thereafter has been extremely busy with the work of the Company. He has seen your letter dated 29th March, 2006.

Please, therefore, ask your clients to note that our client will appoint an Arbitrator within 30 days from the date of his return to India.”

19. These two communications make it clear that the respondent had crystallized the claims on various heads by letter dated 17.4.2006 and the appellant had agreed to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days. The heads that have been mentioned in the letter dated 17.4.2006 pertained to liquidated damages for delay in performance, cost of repairs and rework which had to be done by the respondent, differential cost of the works left over by the appellant and was completed by the respondent through other agencies, cost of direct consequential damages to the respondent due to defect in the work done by the appellant, cost of consultancy fees and other expenses, loss of profit for four years based on revenue generated per employee, etc. and outstanding mobilization advance remaining with the appellant. The total sum as mentioned in the letter was Rs.74,78,34,921.54. From the said amount monies retained by the respondent and monies received by the respondent as per the contract, i.e., Rs.6,14,62,178.46 were reduced. Needless to emphasize, the validity of the claims had to be addressed by the learned Arbitrator but the fact remains that the respondent had raised the claims by giving heads. Thus, there can be no scintilla of doubt that the respondent had particularized or specified its claims and sought arbitration for the same.

20. Keeping in view the aforesaid factual scenario we shall now proceed to appreciate what has been stated by this Court in Praveen Enterprises (supra). In the said case, the respondent therein had raised certain claims and given a notice to the appellant-therein to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration clause. As the appellant did not do so, the respondent filed an application under Section 11 of the Act and an arbitrator was appointed. The respondent filed its claim statement before the arbitrator and the learned arbitrator passed an award. In regard to the counter claims made by the appellant, the arbitrator awarded certain sum without any interest. An application under Section 34 of the Act was filed by the respondent challenging the award for rejection of its other claims and award made on a particular item of the counter claim. The civil court disposed of the matter upholding the award in respect of the claims of the respondent but accepted the objection raised by it in regard to the award made on the counter claim opining that the arbitrator could not have enlarged the scope of the reference and entertain either fresh claims by the claimants or counter claims from the respondent. The said judgment came to be assailed before the High Court which dismissed the appeal by holding that the counter claims were bad in law as they were never placed before the court by the appellant in the proceeding under Section 11 of the Act and they were not referred to by the court to arbitration and, therefore, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter.

21. This Court posed two questions, namely, whether the respondent in an arbitration proceeding is precluded from making a counter claim, unless

(a) it had served a notice upon the claimant requesting that the disputes relating to that counter claim be referred to arbitration and the claimant had concurred in referring the counterclaim to the same arbitrator; and/or (b) it had set out the said counterclaim in its reply statement to the application under Section 11 of the Act and the Chief Justice or his designate refers such counter claim also to arbitration. Thereafter, the Court referred to the concept of “reference to arbitration” and, analyzing the anatomy of Sections 21 and 43 of the Act and Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963, opined thus: - “Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 specifies the date of institution for suit, but does not specify the date of “institution” for arbitration proceedings. Section 21 of the Act supplies the omission. But for Section 21 there would be considerable confusion as to what would be the date of “institution” in regard to the arbitration proceedings. It will be possible for the respondent in an arbitration to argue that the limitation has to be calculated as on the date on which statement of claim was filed, or the date on which the arbitrator entered upon the reference, or the date on which the arbitrator was appointed by the court, or the date on which the application was filed under Section 11 of the Act. In view of Section 21 of the Act providing that the arbitration proceedings shall be deemed to commence on the date on which “a request for that dispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the respondent” the said confusion is cleared. Therefore, the purpose of Section 21 of the Act is to determine the date of commencement of the arbitration proceedings, relevant mainly for deciding whether the claims of the claimant are barred by limitation or not.”

22. Thereafter, addressing the issue pertaining to counter claims, the Court observed as follows: -

“20. As far as counterclaims are concerned, there is no room for ambiguity in regard to the relevant date for determining the limitation. Section 3(2)(b) of the Limitation Act, 1963 provides that in regard to a counterclaim in suits, the date on which the counterclaim is made in court shall be deemed to be the date of institution of the counterclaim. As the Limitation Act, 1963 is made applicable to arbitrations, in the case of a counterclaim by a respondent in an arbitral proceeding, the date on which the counterclaim is made before the arbitrator will be the date of “institution” insofar as counterclaim is concerned. There is, therefore, no need to provide a date of “commencement” as in the case of claims of a claimant. Section 21 of the Act is therefore not relevant for counterclaims. There is however one exception. Where the respondent against whom a claim is made, had also made a claim against the claimant and sought arbitration by serving a notice to the claimant but subsequently raises that claim as a counterclaim in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the claimant, instead of filing a separate application under Section 11 of the Act, the limitation for such counterclaim should be computed, as on the date of service of notice of such claim on the claimant and not on the date of filing of the counterclaim.” [Italics is ours]

23. Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent, submitted that the case of the respondent comes within that exception because it had raised its claims on various dates and crystallized it by letter dated 17.4.2006 and had sought arbitration also. It is his submission that the learned single Judge had incorrectly understood the exception carved out in the aforesaid case and has opined that the date of filing of the counter claims, i.e., 26.9.2011 is the pertinent date. It is urged by him that the Division Bench has correctly determined the date to be 17.4.2006. Mr. Venugopal, learned senior counsel, has disputed the said position by relying upon Section 3 of the Limitation Act which stipulates the limitation to be mandatory.

24. On a careful reading of the verdict in Praveen Enterprises (supra), we find that the two-Judge Bench, after referring to, as we have stated hereinbefore, Sections 21 and 43 of the Act and Section 3 of the Limitation Act has opined, regard being had to the language employed in Section 21, that an exception has to be carved out. It saves the limitation for filing a counter claim if a respondent against whom a claim has been made satisfies the twin test, namely, he had made a claim against the claimant and sought arbitration by serving a notice to the claimant. In our considered opinion the said exception squarely applies to the case at hand inasmuch as the appellant had raised the counter claim and sought arbitration by expressing its intention on number of occasions. That apart, it is also perceptible that the appellant had assured for appointment of an arbitrator. Thus, the counter claim was instituted on 17.4.2006 and hence, the irresistible conclusion is that it is within limitation.

25. Presently to the alternative submission of Mr. Venugopal, learned senior counsel for the appellant. It basically pertains to the nature, scope and gamut of applicability of the exception carved out in Praveen Enterprises (supra) for the purpose of saving a counter claim being barred by limitation. The learned senior counsel would submit that the respondent had crystallized its claims by letter dated 17.4.2006 amounting to Rs.68,63,72,743.08 whereas in the counter claim dated 26.9.2011 filed before the learned Arbitrator amounts to Rs.333,73,35,026/- which is impermissible. In essence, the submission of Mr. Venugopal is that the claims which were not raised in the letter dated 17.4.2006 have to be treated as being barred by limitation. Mr. R.F. Nariman, learned senior counsel for the respondent, on the contrary, has referred to paragraph 11 of the Praveen Enterprises (supra) to buttress his submission that when all the disputes are referred to the arbitrator, he has the jurisdiction to decide all the disputes, i.e., both the claims and counter claims. That apart, the respondent had reserved its rights to quantify the claim. In this regard, he has also drawn inspiration from McDermott International Inc. (supra) wherein this Court has stated that while claiming damages, the amount therefor is not required to be quantified, for quantification of a claim is merely a matter of proof. Mr. Nariman has also commended us to the decision in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and another v. Motorola India Private Limited[8] wherein it has been ruled that the question of holding a person liable for liquidated damages and the question of quantifying the amount to be paid by way of liquidated damages are entirely different. Fixing of liability is primary while the quantification is secondary to it.

26. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid decisions do not render any assistance to the proposition canvassed by the learned senior counsel for the respondent. We are inclined to think so on two counts. First, in Praveen Enterprises (supra) the Court has carved out an exception and, while carving out an exception, has clearly stated that the limitation for “such counter claim” should be computed as on the “date of service of notice” of “such claim on the claimant” and not on the date of final counter claim. We are absolutely conscious that a judgment is not to be read as a statute but to understand the correct ratio stated in the case it is necessary to appreciate the repetitive use of the words. That apart, if the counter claim filed after the prescribed period of limitation before the arbitrator is saved in entirety solely on the ground that a party had vaguely stated that it would be claiming liquidated damages, it would not attract the conceptual exception carved out in Praveen Enterprises (supra). In fact, it would be contrary to the law laid down not only in the said case, but also to the basic principle that a time barred claim cannot be asserted after the prescribed period of limitation.

27. Mr. Nariman, learned senior counsel, has also contended that the counter claims filed before the learned Arbitrator is an elaboration of the amount stated in the notice and, in fact, it is an amendment of the claim of the respondent which deserved to be dealt with by the learned Arbitrator. In this context, we may refer with profit to the ruling in K. Raheja Construcitons Ltd. and another v. Alliance Ministeries and others[9] wherein the plaintiff had filed a suit for permanent injunction and sought an amendment for grant of relief of specific performance. The said prayer was rejected by the learned trial court. A contention was canvassed that the appellant had not come forward with new plea and, in fact, there were material allegations in the plaint to sustain the amendment of the plaint. The Court observed that having allowed the period of seven years to elapse from the date of filing the suit, and the period of limitation being three years under Article 54 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963, any amendment on the grounds set out, would defeat the valuable right of limitation accruing to the respondent. The said principle has been reiterated in South Konkan Distilleries and another v. Prabhakar Gajanan Naik and others[10] and Van Vibhag Karamchari Griha Nirman Sahkari Sanstha Maryadit (Registered) v. Ramesh Chander and others[11].

28. In Revajeetu Builders and Developers v. Narayanaswamy and sons and others[12], while laying down some basic principles for considering the amendment, the Court has stated that as a general rule the court should decline amendments if a fresh suit on the amended claims would be barred by limitation on the date of application.

29. In the present case, when it is absolutely clear that the counter claim in respect of the enhanced sum is totally barred by limitation and is not saved by exception carved out by the principle stated in Praveen Enterprises (supra), we are unable to agree with the view of the Division Bench of the High Court that the counter claim, as a whole, is not barred by limitation. Thus analysed, the counter claim relating to the appeal which deals with civil contracts shall be restricted to the amount stated in the letter dated 17.4.2006, i.e., Rs.68,63,72,178.08, and as far as the other appeal which pertains to air-conditioning contract, the quantum shall stand restricted to as specified in the letter dated 21.3.2006, i.e., Rs.19,99,728.58.

30. At this juncture, we may, for the sake of completeness, deal with the justifiability of the interference by the Division Bench in the award passed by the learned Arbitrator. It has been urged by Mr. Venugopal, learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the view expressed by the learned Arbitrator being a plausible interpretation of the contract the same did not warrant interference. We have already analyzed at length how the interim award is indefensible as there has been incorrect and inapposite appreciation of the proposition of law set out in Praveen Enterprises’s case. In Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (supra) this Court has opined that the learned Arbitrator had placed a possible interpretation on clause 9.3 of the contract involved therein and hence, the interference was exceptionable. In the present case, the factual matrix and the controversy that have emanated are absolutely different and hence, the principle stated in the said authority is not applicable. Thus, we unhesitatingly repel the submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the award passed by the learned Arbitrator did not call for any interference.

31. Consequently, both the appeals are allowed in part, the judgment of the Division Bench in Appeals Nos. 7 of 2013 and 8 of 2013 is modified and the interim award passed by learned Arbitrator as regards rejection of the counter claims in toto stands nullified. The learned Arbitrator shall now proceed to deal with the counter claims, as has been indicated hereinabove by us. Needless to say, we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the claims or the counter claims put forth by the parties before the learned Arbitrator. The parties shall bear their respective costs.",1
Jharkhand State Elect.Board & Or,"The appellant in both the cases is Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB), which is aggrieved by the common judgment dated 5th July 2011 passed by the High Court of Jharkhand in two appeals. These appeals were preferred by the appellant JSEB against the orders dated 17th February 2010 passed by the learned Single Judge of that court in the two Writ Petitions which were filed by M/s. Laxmi Business & Cement Co. Pvt. Ltd. and M/s. Laxmi Ispat Udyog (arrayed as respondent No.1 in each appeal and hereinafter referred to as the ‘consumers’). These respondents had questioned the validity of the bills raised by the JSEB in those Writ Petitions, primarily on the ground that the bills were contrary to and in excess of the tariff fixed by the Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SERC”). Their contention was accepted by the learned Single Judge and the order of learned Single Judge is affirmed by the Division Bench as well.

4. To give a glimpse of the controversy involved, in the year 1994 HT Agreement was entered into between Bihar State Electricity Board (predecessor in interest of JSEB) and the consumers which, inter-alia, stipulated the tariff that was to be charged by the JSEB from the consumers for supply of electricity to these consumers by the JSEB. In Clause 4(c) of the Agreement there was a provision of Minimum Guarantee Charges. In the year 2003, Electricity Act was enacted. Indubitably, power to frame tariff under this Act is given to SERC. SERC passed order dated framing the new tariff schedule (‘2004 Tariff Schedule’ for short) under Section 86 of the Electricity Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The JSEB, however, continued to send the bills as per the Clause 4(c) referred to in the agreement which were paid by the consumers under protest. In May 2010, Writ Petitions were filed by the consumers for quashing of the energy bills on the ground that it had wrongly been raised as per Clause 4(c) of the Agreement which had ceased to have any effect on the framing of 2004 Tariff Schedule by the SERC. The JSEB, however, contended that the HT agreement entered into with the consumers still survived as the 2004 Tariff Schedule saves this Agreement.

5. Since the Writ Petitions of the consumers were allowed and the order of the learned Single Judge is already upheld by the Division Bench, it is obvious that pleas raised by the JSEB have not found favour with the High Court. Before us as well, same very contentions were raised which were raised by the JSEB in the High Court. Additionally, it was also contended that even Section 185 (2)(a) of the Act read with Section 6(B) of the General Clauses Act categorically protects the previous operation of the earlier enactment, duly done or saved thereunder.

It is, thus, clear that questions which arise for consideration in these appeals are the following:

(i) Whether after the enactment of the Electricity Act, 2003 which came into force on 10.6.2003 and after passing of the new tariff order dated 27.12.2003 by Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission as per the Act of 2003 can the State Electricity Board still charge a tariff determined by itself?

(ii) Whether the issue of demand charge to HTS – 1 category of consumers has been left non-considered by the State Commission in the tariff order dated 27.12.2003 so that the same may be continued in the manner existed in the State or whether the same has been considered and given affect to in the tariff order dated 27.12.2003 which came into effect from 1.1.2004?

(iii) What would be the effect of Section 185 (Repeal and Saving Clause) of the Electricity Act 2003 upon the HT supply Agreement entered upon the Board and the Consumer prior to Electricity Act, 2003?

6. While dealing with these questions, we will narrate further seminal facts and the details submissions of the learned counsel for the parties of either side.

1. Re.: Power of SERC under Electricity Act 2003.

Legal position contained in Act of 2003 is hardly in dispute. Before this Act was enacted in the year 2003, we had Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and thereafter Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 was passed. It is the Electricity Board in the respective States which were supplying electricity to the consumers and determining the operation rates at which the electricity was to be supplied. Section 49 of the Act, 1948 empowered the Board to supply electricity to any person upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and made for the purposes of such supply from time to time and were empowered to frame uniform tariffs for the purpose of such supply. This power to frame tariff under Section 49(1) of the Act 1948 included the power to fix minimum guarantee charges. In State of Bihar, such rates were fixed in the year 1993 tariff. It, inter-alia, provided for tariff for HT consumers. Three categories of HT consumers were mentioned there. HTS-I, II and III. Both the consumers in the instant appeals were put in HT-I category. HT Agreement dated 26.4.1974 was entered into between the Board and the consumers. As per Clause 4 of this Agreement, the consumers were to pay to the Board for the energy so supplied and registered or taken to have been supplied at the appropriate rates applicable to the consumers according to the tariff framed by the Board and in force from time to time. It was subject to the minimum contract demand applicable for the category of supply category in which the consumers fell. Clause 4(b) explained that the maximum demand of the consumer for each month shall be the largest total amount of kilovolt amperes (KVA) that was delivered to the consumers at the point of supply during any consecutive 30 minutes in the months. Since the JSEB has worked out the charges as per Clause 4 (c) which it is demanding, we reproduce the said clause hereinbelow:

“4(c) Maximum demand charges for supply in any month will be based on the maximum KVA demand for the month or 75 per cent of the contract demand whichever is higher, subject to provision of clause 13. For the first twelve months service the maximum demand charges for any month, will however, be based on the actual monthly maximum demand for that month.” Thus, as per the aforesaid clause, JSEB had been raising energy bills on the basis of 75% of the contract demand.
7. As mentioned above, after the Electricity Act, 2003 was enacted, power to frame tariff is given to the SERC. This power is statutorily conferred upon the SERC under the Act. However, it would be relevant to mention herein that before the passing of this Act, Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998 was enacted and under Section 17 of the said Act, Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission was constituted by the Government of Jharkhand vide Notification No.1763 dated August 22, 2002. Its functions and duties were notified by the Government as per Section 22 of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act.

8. On the passing of the Electricity Act, 2003, Electricity Act 1910, Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 and Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998 have been repealed. At the same time, Act 2003 recognizes the SERCs constituted under the 1998 Act. The object clause of this Act reads as under:

“An Act to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to development of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting interest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalization of electricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”
9. It is also not in dispute that 2004 Tariff Schedule framed by the SERC is in exercise of powers conferred upon it under Section 86 (a) of the Act. In PTC India Ltd. V. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (2010) 4 SCC 603 this Court has categorically held that Act, 2003 is an exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity which also provides for “unbundling” of State Electricity Boards into separate utilities for generation, transmission and distribution. Further, Regulatory regime is entrusted to the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions which are given vide ranging responsibilities. This Act has distanced the Government from all forms of regulations, including tariff regulation which is now specifically assigned to SERC. Relevant observations, outlining the scheme of this Act, are reproduced below:

“The 2003 Act is enacted as an exhaustive code on all matters concerning electricity. It provides for unbundling” of SEBs into separate utilities for generation, transmission and distribution. It repeals the Electricity Act, 1910: the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998. The 2003 Act, in furtherance of the policy envisaged under the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 (the 1998 Act), mandated the establishment of an independent and transparent regulatory mechanism, and has entrusted wide-ranging responsibilities with the Regulatory Commissions. While the 1998 Act provided for independent regulation in the area of tariff determination: the 2003 Act has distanced the Government from all forms of regulation, namely, licensing, tariff regulation, specifying Grid Code, facilitating competition through open access, etc.”[Paragraph 17] The 2003 Act contains separate provisions for the performance of dual functions by the Commission. Section61 is the enabling provision for framing of regulations by the Central Commission: the determination of terms and conditions of tariff has been left to the domain of the Regulatory Commissions under Section 61 of the Act whereas actual tariff determination by the Regulatory Commissions is covered by Section 62 of the Act. This aspect is very important for deciding the present case. Specifying the terms and conditions for determination of tariff is an exercise which is different and distinct from actual tariff determination in accordance with the provisions of the Act for supply of electricity by a generating company to a distribution licensee or for transmission of electricity or for wheeling of electricity or for retail sale of electricity.
26. The term “tariff” is not defined in the 2003 Act. The term “tariff” includes within its ambit not only the fixation of rates but also the rules and regulations relating to it. If one reads Section 61 with Section 62 of the 2003 Act, it becomes clear that the appropriate Commission shall determine the actual tariff in accordance with the provisions of the Act, including the terms and conditions which may be specified by the appropriate Commission under Section 61 of the said Act. Under the 2003 Act, if one reads Section 62 with Section 64, it becomes clear that although tariff fixation like price fixation is legislative in character, the same under the Act is made applicable vide Section
111. These provisions, namely, Sections 61, 62 and 64 indicate the dual nature of functions performed by the Regulatory Commissions viz. decision-making and specifying terms and conditions for tariff determination.”[Paragraph 25,26] [Emphasis supplied]
10. It is, thus, beyond the pale of doubt that the State Electricity Boards have no power whatsoever to frame tariff which is under the exclusive domain of the Commission. This legal position has been judicially recognized. [See Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. V. Essar Power Ltd., (2008) 4 SCC 755 and A.P. TRANSCO v. Sai Renewable Power (P) Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC

34.

11. Notwithstanding the aforesaid legal position, JSEB contends that agreement entered into with the consumers in the year 1994 is saved and the JSEB has right to charge the tariff as per Clause 4 (c) thereof. According to the JSEB this is the position because of the reason that Clause 1.4 of the 2004 Tariff Schedule framed by the SERC provides for such a position and further that even Section 186 of the Act 2003 saves this agreement. On these twin aspects, we have already framed question Nos. 2 and 3 above and would now proceed to deal with them.

2. Re: Whether the Agreement dated 26.4.1994 is saved by the 2004 Tariff Schedule?

Mr. Sinha, learned senior counsel for the JSEB submitted that in the 2004 Tariff Schedule there was no such provision which is contained in the agreement dated 26.4.19994 particularly in Clause 4(c) and in the absence thereof in the tariff schedule energy bills raised on the basis of 75 % contract demand was saved. It was submitted that the Agreement dated 26.4.1994 is a statutory agreement as it was under the Act of 1948. The learned senior counsel further submitted that it had never been the case of consumers that the aforesaid provision was repealed, repudiated or destroyed. It has not happened either. For this purpose, Mr. Sinha sought to rely upon averments made in the Writ Petitions filed by the consumers and on the basis it was contended that even the consumers admitted that the provision of 75% of contract demand is absent and not provided in the 2004 Tariff Schedule. He also placed strong reliance on Clause 1.4 of 2004 Tariff Schedule of SERC which reads as under:

“All other Terms and Conditions in respect of Meter Rent, Supply at Lower Voltage, Capacitor Charge, Electricity Duty, Rebate, Security Deposit, Surcharge for exceeding contract demand etc., shall remain the same as existing in the State.” Further, the tariff order 2003-04, in Clause 5 under the heading Design of Tariff Structure and Analysis of Tariff, particularly at Clause 5.4 has dealt with the two part tariff structure and Minimum Guarantee Charges wherein it was stated that “Ideally, the fixed/demand charge should be levied in proportion to the demand placed by an individual consumer on the system. This is so because it facilitates the utility in designing an appropriate system to cater to the supply needs of a consumer and is therefore a just and fair mechanism for recovering fixed costs of the system.” Mr. Sinha further argued that Clause 4 (c) of the High Tension Agreement dated 26.8.2004 which the Respondent Consumer has signed with the Board much after 1.1.2004, when the Tariff Order 2003-04 came into effect, clearly specified that after commencement of power supply, the respondent shall be liable to pay KVA/Maximum Demand Charges on actual consumption basis in the first 12 months and after that on the basis of 75% of the contract demand or recorded demand, whichever is higher. This is uniformly applied to similarly situated all the HTS-1 consumers.
12. In order to appreciate this argument, we will have to construe relevant provision of 2004 Tariff Schedule as framed by the SERC. It would be pertinent to observe that the SERC fixed the tariff on the request of the JSEB itself when it approached the SERC for this purpose. We find that in the Tariff Petition filed by the JSEB before the SERC, the JSEB did not propose to continue the manner of 75% of contract demand and the SERC allowed the demand charge 140-KV-Month. On perusal of the Tariff Order, it becomes apparent that this is divided in different sections viz., section 1 is the chapter containing ‘introduction’, section 2 is the chapter containing ‘ARR’ i.e. the Annual Revenue Requirement and tariff proposal submitted by the Board, section 3 is the chapter containing ‘objections’ received from the stake holders, section 4 is the chapter containing ‘Commission’s analysis on ARR’, Section 5 is the chapter containing ‘design of tariff structure and analysis of tariff’, section 6 is the chapter containing ‘Directions to the JSEB’ and finally there is Annexure 5.1 containing the ‘Tariff Schedule’. This Tariff Schedule which is the final outcome of the tariff process is binding on the State as well. The relevant portion of the Annexure 5.1 of the tariff order wherein the State Commission has dealt with the tariff applicability upon the High Tension Service (HTS) consumers i.e. category applicable to Respondent No.1 is reproduced below:

“Category: High Tension Service (HTS)
1. Applicability For consumers having contract demand above 100 kVA
2. Character of service 50 cycles, 3 Phase at 6.6. KV/11 Kv/33 kV or 132 kV.

13.     However,   as   stated   above,   the    JSEB    itself    in    its
application/reference to the SERC did not ask for fixing any minimum guarantee charges. It would be relevant to mention that the JSEB in its proposal for fixation of tariff for 2003-04, submitted before the Regulatory Commission, indicated both the existing tariff and the tariff proposed by it in respect of all consumers, including all categories of HTS (High Tension Service) consumers. The SERC after undertaking the necessary exercise, fixed the tariff of all categories. The tariff proposed by the Board for HTS-I consumers along with existing tariff is reproduced in Tables 5.28 and 5.29 of the 2004 Tariff Schedule which will clearly reflect that the aspect of minimum guarantee charges was duly considered by the SERC. To demonstrate it, we reproduce the said two tables hereunder:
5.28 Tariff for HTS-II Consumers (Existing/Proposed ) | DESCRIPTION | TARIFF | DEMAND CHARGE | | Existing | Proposed | |Rs./KVA/Month | 115 | 200 | ENERGY CHARGE |Rs./KWH | Existing | Proposed | |All Consumption | 1.72 | 4.30 | FUEL SURCHARGE CHARGE |Rs./KWH | 2.44 | - | Annual Minimum Guarantee (AMG) Charge | |Subject to minimum |The following AMG charge| | |contract demand for this|shall be realized from | | |category, monthly |the consumer as per | | |minimum demand charge as|appropriate tariff. | | |per appropriate tariff | | | |based on actual maximum |AMG Charge based on load| | |demand of that month or |factor of 30% and power | | |75% of the contract |factor 0.9 on contract | | |demand whichever is |demand payable at the | | |higher. |rate of energy charge | | |Energy charges based on |applicable to HTS-II | | |load factor of 30% and |category. | | |power factor 0.85 on | | | |contracted demand | | | |payable at the rate of | | | |Rs.1.72/KWH | | 5.29 Tariff for EHTS Consumers (Existing/Proposed) | DESCRIPTION | TARIFF | DEMAND CHARGE | | Existing | Proposed | |Rs./KVA/Month | 110 | 200 | ENERGY CHARGE |Rs./KWH | Existing | Proposed | |All Consumption | 4.13 | 4.15 | FUEL SURCHARGE |Rs./KWH | 2.44 | - | Annual Minimum Guarantee (AMG) Charge | |Subject to minimum |The following AMG charge| | |contract demand for this|shall be realized from | | |category, monthly |the consumer as per | | |minimum demand charge as|appropriate tariff. | | |per appropriate tariff | | | |based on actual maximum | | | |demand of that month or |AMG Charge based on load| | |75% of the contract |factor of 50% and power | | |demand whichever is |factor 0.9 on contract | | |higher |demand payable at the | | | |rate of energy charge | | |Energy charges based on |applicable to EHTS | | |load factor of 50% and |category. | | |power factor 0.85 on | | | |contracted demand | | | |payable at the rate of | | | |Rs.1.69/KWH | |
14. The tariff order further reveals that the SERC had even compared the proposal of JSEB with the tariff prevailing in other States in India and after detailed analysis thereof, it approved the tariff for HTS consumers which is mentioned in table 5.31 of the 2004 Tariff Schedule. Therefore, it cannot be said that the SERC was oblivious of the clause relating to minimum guarantee charges which JSEB was charging from its consumers as per the earlier agreements entered into with them. The position would become crystal clear from the following discussion in the 2004 Tariff Schedule wherein the SCRC gave specific reasons for revising and approving the tariff for HTS consumers.

The SERC has filed its response to these appeals, wherein the provision in this behalf is explained in the manner noted below: “It is evident from the above table that there is no common approach towards minimum charge. However, if we compare neighbouring States like Orissa, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh (supply at less than 132 KVA), there is no minimum charge. As mentioned earlier, the Commission would ideally like to scrap this charge, but for current year it has retained this charge due to lack of information and data to ascertain the true impact of this charge. The Commission has already directed the Board to provide details in this regard in the next petition.

For the current year, the Commission would not like to increase the burden on the industries on account of minimum charge and has therefore attempted to keep it at the existing level. The Commission has assumed a minimum level of supply and a minimum level of consumption. For this, the Commission has considered 10% load factor for HTS-I and HTS-II categories considering an average consumption of two (2) hours in a day. For EHTS and HT Special load factor of 20% and 30% respectively has been taken by considering an average consumption of four (4) hours and seven (7) hours in a day respectively. The Commission observes that if these categories of industries are not able to maintain this minimum load factor, than they should reduce their contracted load. The Commission would like to explicitly mention that if the consumption exceeds the mentioned load factor, no minimum charge would be applicable.

For encouraging consumption, the Commission has also introduced a load factor rebate for all industries consumers. For the entire consumption in excess of this defined load factor, a rebate is provided on the energy charges for such excess consumption. The Commission would have liked to align the tariff structure towards cost of supply during the current year itself, but it was constrained due to the huge tariff shock that it would translate into for other consumes and consequent increase that would have been required in tariff for other categories. Thus as a principle the Commission has taken the first step towards reducing this distortion in the tariff structure. The Commission is conscious of the fact that HT industry in Jharkhand has borne the brunt of cross subsidy in the past and the tariff applicable to them is above the cost of supply. The significance of this step should not, however, be judged by the quantitative decline but the signal and intent whereby the Commission intends to further rationalize the tariff in the future.”

15. We would like to reproduce the following discussion in the impugned judgment of the High Court, as we are in agreement therewith the observations made in those paragraphs:

“……10.We are concerned with the Demand Charge only, rather to say not concerned with the Demand Charge itself but the manner in which the Demand Charge can be calculated for the purpose of raising demand against the consumer charging of the Demand Charge “has been allowed in Tariff Order 2003-04 @ Rs.140/- as mentioned at page 141 of the Tariff Order. As we have already noticed that a formula was given in Clause 15.2 in the tariff of 1993 as well as in the contract on the basis of which the Board was charging the Demand Charge on the basis of the actual consumed units but was charging the said amount irrespective of the consumption of the units of electricity. Now the contention of the respondent- writ petitioners is that they are liable only according to the units consumed by them and not according to the formula. We found from Board’s proposal contained in Table 5.27 that the Electricity Board consciously (or may inadvertently) submitted its proposal only to the effect that existing annual Demand Charge is Rs.125/- per KVA per month. This proposal of the Board was considered and ultimately the Demand Charge was allowed by the Tariff Order of 2003-04 which is mentioned at page 141by which only it has been approved that the Electricity Board shall be entitled to charge Rs.140/- per KVA per month as proposed by the Board, the Tariff Order of 2003-04 increased it to Rs.140/- only.
11. In view of the above reasons, we cannot hold that the Electricity Regulatory Commission has not considered the proposal of the Electricity Board with respect to their claim for Demand Charge and the manner in which it will be charged……”
12.In view of the above facts, we are of the considered opinion that the appellant-Board cannot take help of Clause 5.1. wherein Electricity Regulatory Commission wherein it has been observed that some of the matters have not been dealt with and they shall continue to be the same as they were in existence in the State because of the reason that there is a specific proposal made by the Electricity Board for the Demand Charge as well as the manner in which it will be charged and this proposal was considered by the Electricity Regulatory Commission and thereafter Tariff Order has been issued…”
16. To put the matter beyond the pale of controversy, we would like to highlight another fact, namely the JSEB had even filed clarification applications before the SERC contending that having regard to the Clause 4(c) of the Agreement with the HT-I consumers, the maximum demand charges would be those prescribed under Clause 4(c) of the Agreement. These applications were specifically rejected by the Commission. No appeal was preferred by the JSEB challenging those orders. It is, therefore, too late in the day for the JSEB to now argue that this aspect of minimum guarantee charge has not been dealt with by the SERC in the 2004 Tariff Schedule.

3. Re.: Effect of Section 185 of the Electricity Act 2003.

Submission of Mr. Sinha, learned senior counsel, predicated on Section 185 (2)(a) of the Electricity Act and Section 6 (B) of the General Clauses Act, was that by virtue of the aforesaid provision the earlier Agreement of 1994, including Clause 4(c) thereof entered into between the Electricity Board and the consumers was saved. Section 185(2)(a) of the Act reads as under:

“anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including any rule, notification, inspection, order or notice made or issued or any appointment, confirmation or declaration made or any license, permission, authorization or exemption granted or any document or instrument executed or any direction given under the repealed laws shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act.” We also reproduce Section 6(B) of the General Clauses Act hereinbelow:
“affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or”
17. It was the submission that since all the actions deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provision of the earlier Act are saved, the Agreement in question which was entered into by the Electricity Board in exercise of statutory power and was having legal force, had been saved under the aforesaid provisions. To prop this submission, Mr. Sinha also referred to the judgment of this Court in the case of Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory Commission & Anr. v. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (2013) 12 SCALE 397 with the plea that this very aspect had been specifically dealt with in the aforesaid judgment and therefore the issue was no longer res-integra. Mr. Sinha pointed out that in that case the courts specifically dealt with the effect of repealed provision contained in Section 185 of the Act, 2003 read with Section 6(B) of the General Clauses Act and held that the previous agreements were saved unless it could be pointed out that there was a manifest intention to destroy them. He referred to the following passage from the earlier judgment in the case of State of Punjab vs. Mohar Singh 1955 (1) SCR 893 which is quoted in the aforesaid judgment and reads as under:
“Whenever there is a repeal of an enactment, the consequences laid down in Section 6 of the General Clauses Act will follow unless, as the section itself says, a different intention appears. In the case of a simple repeal there is scarcely any room for expression of a contrary opinion. But when the repeal is followed by fresh legislation on the same subject we would undoubtedly have to look to the provisions of the new Act, but only for the purpose of determining whether they indicate a different intention. The line of enquiry would be, not whether the new Act expressly keeps alive old rights and liabilities but whether it manifests an intention to destroy them. We cannot therefore subscribe to the broad proposition that section 6 of the General Clauses Act is ruled out when there is repeal of an enactment followed by a fresh legislation. Section 6 would be applicable in such cases also unless the new legislation manifests an intention incompatible with or contrary to the provisions of the section. Such incompatibility would have to be ascertained from a consideration of all the relevant provisions of the new law and the mere absence of a saving clause is by itself not material. It is in the light of these principles that we now proceed to examine the facts of the present case.” (underlining is ours) He also banked upon the following discussion in the said judgment:
“We have referred to the aforesaid paragraphs as Mr.Gupta has contended that when there is repeal of an enactment and substitution of new law, ordinarily the vested right of a forum has to perish. On reading of Section 185 of the 2003 Act in entirety, it is difficult to accept the submission that even if Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would apply, then also the same does not save the forum of appeal. We do not perceive any contrary intention that 6 of the General Clauses Act would not be applicable. It is also to be kept in mind that the distinction between what is and what is not a right by the provisions of the Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is often one of great fitness. What is unaffected by the repeal of a statute is a right acquired or accrued under it and not a mere hope, or expectation of, or liberty to apply for, acquiring right (See M.S.Shivanand v.Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and Ors. MANU/SC/0371/1979: (1980) 1 SCC 149).”
18. In order to appreciate this argument, we will have to traverse through some salient provision of the agreement of 1994 entered into with the consumers. These are paras 4(c) and 11 of the HT agreement:
“4..(c) Maximum demand charge for supply in any month will be based on the maximum KVA demand for the month of 75% of the contract demand whichever is higher, subject to provision of clause 13……..
11. This agreement shall be read and construed as subject to the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, rules framed thereunder, the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 together with rules, regulations (if any) tariffs and terms and conditions for supply of electricity framed and issued thereunder and for the time being in force as far as the same may respectively be applicable and all such provisions shall prevail in case of any conflict or inconsistency between them and the terms and conditions of this agreement.”
19. It is also to be borne in mind that the tariff in force during the period was Tariff Order dated 27.12.2003 for the period 2003-04 which was having force of law under the Electricity Act 2003. Thus, what follows from the above is that even if we proceed on the basis that the statutory agreements entered into earlier were saved, the agreement in question stands replaced by 2004 Tariff Schedule. At this juncture, we would like to refer to the judgment of this Court in the case of BSES v. Tata Power Co.Ltd. (2004) 1 SCC 195 wherein following pertinent observations were made.
“16. The word “tariff” has not been defined in the Act. “Tariff” is a cartel of commerce and normally it is a book of rates. It will mean a schedule of standard prices or charges provided to the category or categories of customers specified in the tariff. Sub-section (1) of Section 22 clearly lays down that the State Commission shall determine the tariff for electricity (wholesale, bulk, grid or retail) and also for use of transmission facilities. It has also the power to regulate power purchase of the distribution utilities including the price at which the power shall be procured from the generating companies for transmission, sale, distribution and supply in the State. “Utility” has been defined in Section 2(1) of the Act and it means any person or entity engaged in the generation, transmission, sale, distribution or supply, as the case may be, of energy. Section 29 lays down that the tariff for the intra-State transmission of electricity and tariff for supply of electricity — wholesale, bulk or retail — in a State shall be subject to the provisions of the Act and the tariff shall be determined by the State Commission. Sub-section (2) of Section 29 shows that the terms and conditions for fixation of tariff shall be determined by Regulations and while doing so, the Commission shall be guided by the factors enumerated in clauses (a) to (g) thereof. The Regulations referred to earlier show that generating companies and utilities have to first approach the Commission for approval of their tariff whether for generation, transmission, distribution or supply and also for terms and conditions of supply. They can charge from their customers only such tariff which has been approved by the Commission. Charging of a tariff which has not been approved by the Commission is an offence which is punishable under Section 45 of the Act. The provisions of the Act and Regulations show that the Commission has the exclusive power to determine the tariff. The tariff approved by the Commission is final and binding and it is not permissible for the licensee, utility or anyone else to charge a different tariff.”
20. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that even the argument based on Section 185 of the Electricity Act, 2003 would not bring any change to the results of this case. We, thus, do not fault with the judgment of the High Court appealed against.

21. Before we part with, it is necessary to deal with one more argument of the appellant. It was submitted that there was delay in filing the Writ Petitions inasmuch as bills raised by the JSEB on the basis of Clause 4(c) of the 1994 Agreement, even after the formulation of 2004 Tariff Schedule were being paid by the consumers and they approached the Court by filing Writ Petitions only in the year 2010. Thus, there was a delay and latches of 5 years. It is further argued that in such scenario, the High Court at least should not have directed the appellants to refund the excess amount charged under the bills raised for earlier period. Other related submission was that it would be unjust enrichment to the consumers who would have recovered the amount from the user of the electricity.

22. In so far as delay in filing the Writ Petition is concerned, it appears from the chronology of events that the same has been duly explained. It is not in doubt that the consumers had paid the amount of bills raised by JSEB under protest because of the threat of disconnection. While doing so, they had raised specific plea with the JSEB that it was now supposed to raise the bills in accordance with the 2004 Tariff Schedule. The matter remained under consideration at the level of JSEB which kept approaching the Court as well as SERC seeking clarification of 2004 Tariff Schedule. As already pointed out above, clarification applications were filed which were dismissed by the Commission. However, as the JSEB did not judge from its stand even after the dismissal of these applications, the consumers approached the Court and filed the Writ Petitions. The Writ Petitioners have thus furnished satisfactory explanation for approach the Court.

23. The plea of unjust and enrichment will not be available to the appellants. In the first place, no such plea was raised before the High Court either before the learned Single Judge or the Division Bench. In the Special Leave Petition, this submission was made for the first time at the time of hearing of the present appeals. Moreover, it is not a case of payment of tax which is a burden passed on the consumers. It is only in such cases that was held in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India (1997) 5 SCC 536 that the question of unjust enrichment would arise for consideration. As far as issue like the present is concerned, such a question was left open in para 107 of the aforesaid judgment. The Court had made it clear the concept of unjust enrichment had no application for refunds other than taxes, as is clear from the reading thereof.",0
Birju,"We are, in this case, concerned with the killing of a child aged one year who was in the arms of PW1, the grand-father, for which the accused was awarded death sentence by the trial court, which was affirmed by the High Court and these appeals have been preferred by the accused against the judgment of conviction and sentence awarded to him for the offences under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959.

2. The prosecution case, in short, is as follows:

PW1, the complainant was standing at the grocery shop of Kamal Bansal (PW2) on 13.12.2009 at about 8.15 PM for purchasing some goods. He was holding his grandson, Arman, aged one year in his arms. PW4, Jagdish, was also standing in front of the said shop. The accused-Birju, resident of the same locality, known as Rustam Ka Bagicha, came out there on a motorcycle. After parking the motorcycle, he went to Babulal and questioned him as to why he was standing there. Babulal replied that he had come to purchase some kirana. While so, the accused-appellant demanded Rs.100/- for consuming liquor. Babulal expressed his inability to give the money, on which, the accused abused him in the name of his mother and took out a country made pistol from his pocket and shot, which hit on the right temporal area of infant- Arman. Persons of the locality, which included Rakhi, daughter of the complainant, her aunt-in-law Sharda Bai and few other inhabitants of the area, reached the spot after hearing the sound. Son-in-law of the complainant, Jeevan, took Arman to the hospital and PW1 immediately reached the police station and lodged the first information report.

3. PW 12, the Station House Officer, reached the spot and prepared a spot map (Ext.P/2) and seized the blood stained shirt of complainant Babulal vide seizure memo (Ext.P/3). Empty cartridge, motorcycle and used bullet were seized from the spot vide seizure memo (Ext.P/6). Inquest report (Ext.P/8) was prepared on the dead body, which was then sent for post-mortem examination. PW10 Dr. A.K. Langewar conducted the post-mortem examination.

4. The accused was later nabbed and from his possession pistol was recovered and seized articles were sent for examination to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Tamil Nadu vide Ext.P/18-A. The investigation officer recorded the statements of witnesses and completed the investigation and the accused was charge-sheeted under Sections 302, 327 and 398 of the IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act, 1959.

5. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses and produced 19 documents and none was examined on the side of the defence.

6. As already indicated, after appreciating the oral and documentary evidence, the trial court found the accused guilty and held that the case of the accused falls under “rarest of rare” category and awarded capital punishment, which was affirmed by the High Court. The accused was also convicted under Section 27 of the Arms Act and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years and a fine of Rs.1000/-, which was also affirmed by the High Court.

7. Mr. Rana Ranjit Singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that the case on hand is not the one which falls in the category of “rarest of rare” warranting capital punishment. Learned counsel pointed out that even if the entire prosecution case is accepted, the offence would be covered under Section 304 Part II IPC. Learned counsel also pointed out that the accused had no intention to kill either PW1 or the child. The accused, at best, was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance and there will be no occasion for him to indulge in similar offence in future, and the possibility of accused being reformed could not be ruled out. Learned counsel also submitted that the trial court and the High Court have committed an error in awarding the death sentence on the ground that the accused was involved in various other criminal cases which, according to the counsel, cannot be an aggravating factor to be taken into consideration for the purpose of awarding the death sentence.

8. Mr. C.D. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the State, on the other hand, pointed out that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. Learned counsel referred to the evidence of PW4 and PW7 and stated that they were eye-witnesses to the incident and there is no reason to discard their oral evidence. Learned counsel submitted that the murder was committed in cold blooded manner and evidence on record clearly shows that the accused has absolutely no regard for the life or limb of others. Learned counsel also submitted that there is no probability of reformation or rehabilitation of the accused. Learned counsel also submitted that, in the instant case, crime test, criminal test and R-R test have been fully satisfied and there is no reason to interfere with the death sentence awarded by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court.

9. PWs 1 to 4 and 7 fully and completely supported the case of the prosecution. PW1, the grand-father of the child, PWs 2, 3, 4 and 7 have depicted an eye-to-eye picture of what transpired on the fateful day. Their version is consistent and highly reliable. Eye witnesses’ version is fully corroborated with post-mortem and FSL reports. PW6, of course, has been declared as hostile, but the evidence of a hostile witness cannot be discarded as a whole and the relevant parts thereof, which are admissible in law, can be used, either by the prosecution or the defence. Reference may be made to the judgment of this Court in C. Muniappan and Others v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 9 SCC 567. PW6, in his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. has stated that, on the date of the incident, he heard PW1 shouting “goli mar di”, “goli mar di”, which indicates that, to that extent, the statement supports the prosecution. The incident, as already stated, happened in front of a grocery shop at about 8.15 PM on 13.12.2009 when PW1 was standing in front of the grocery shop of PW2. Accused, at that time, reached the spot and demanded Rs.100/-, which PW1 refused to pay and, for that sole reason, he took out the pistol from his pocket and shot, which hit the temporal region of Arman, aged one year and he died.

10. Motive for committing the murder was evidently for getting the money to consume liquor for which, unfortunately, a child of one year became the casualty. The country made pistol used for committing the offence was subsequently recovered. PW10, who conducted the post- mortem on the dead body of the child, noticed various injuries and reiterated that the bullet had pierced through the meningeal membranes and both the lobes of the brain. PW10 Doctor opined that the wound was caused by firearm and the deceased died within 24 hours of post-mortem examination. The prosecution has successfully proved the cause of death and the use of the firearm by the accused and we fully concur with the findings of the trial court, affirmed by the High Court that offences under Section 302 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959, have been made out.

11. We are now concerned with the question whether the case falls under the category of “rarest of rare”, warranting the death sentence.

12. We have held in Shankar Kisnrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra (2013) 5 SCC 546 that even if the crime test and criminal test have been fully satisfied, to award the death sentence, the prosecution has to satisfy the R-R Test. We have noticed that one of the factors which weighed with the trial court as well as the High Court to award death sentence to the accused was his criminal antecedents. The High Court while dealing with the criminal antecedents of the accused stated as follows:

“14. The appellant is having criminal antecedent, which is clear from the statement of investigating officer (PW-12) Mohan Singh in paragraph 12, wherein he has deposed that the appellant is a notified bully in the concerned police station and as many as 24 criminal cases were registered against him by the police, out of which three cases of murder and two were attempt to commit murder. In all these cases, after investigation, appellant was charge sheeted for trial before the court of law. In cross-examination, this statement has been challenged by the defence. In paragraph 13 only question was put to this witness that along with the charge sheet list of criminal cases were not filed, on which witness replied that same is available in the case diary. After this answer, counsel for the appellant did not ask the Court to verify this fact and also no suggestion was given to this witness that appellant was not facing prosecution in all the above mentioned criminal cases. These facts are sufficient to hold that appellant was fully aware about the use and consequence of the deadly weapon like pistol, and when his demand was not satisfied; he used the same intentionally to commit murder of child, Arman. The injuries show that pistol was fired very accurately and bullet pierced through and through at the vital part of the body i.e. skull. When appellant was using firearm for causing injury to infant Arman, he must be knowing the consequence that because of use of such deadly weapon, there would be no chance for survival of a child aged one year.”
13. Further, the High Court also, after referring to the various cases, where this Court had awarded death sentence, considered the present case as rarest of rare one and stated as follows:

“26. In the light of aforesaid legal position for considering whether the instant case falls within the category of rarest in rare case, we visualize the following circumstances :-
i) The offence was not committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.
ii) Appellant is a quite matured person aged about 45 years. He is neither young nor old.
iii) Looking to his criminal antecedent i.e. he was charge sheeted for commission of 24 criminal cases, out of which 3 were under Section 302 of “the IPC” and 2 were under Section 307 of “the IPC”, therefore, there is no probability that the accused would not commit acts of violence in future and his presence in society would be a continuing threat to society.
iv) There is no probability or possibility of reformation or rehabilitation of the appellant.
v) In the facts and circumstances of the present case, accused/appellant cannot morally justify the commission of murder of child aged one year by him.
vi) There is no direct or indirect evidence available to say that accused acted under the duress or domination of another person.
vii) The condition of appellant/accused was not such, which may show that he was mentally defective and the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.
viii) It is purely a cold blooded murder and evidence on record clearly showing the fact that appellant has absolutely no regard for life and limb of others.”
14. One of the factors which weighed with the High Court to affirm the death sentence was that the accused was charge-sheeted for commissioning of 24 criminal cases, out of which three were under Section 302 IPC and two were under Section 307 IPC, consequently, the Court held that there was no probability that the accused would not commit the act of violence in future and his presence would be a continuing threat to the society. The Court also took the view that there was no possibility or probability of reformation or rehabilitation of the accused.

15. We have in Shankar Kisanrao Khade’s case (supra) dealt with the question as to whether the previous criminal record of the accused would be an aggravating circumstance to be taken note of while awarding death sentence and held that the mere pendency of few criminal cases, as such, is not an aggravating circumstance to be taken note of while awarding death sentence, since the accused is not found guilty and convicted in those cases. In the instant case, it was stated, that the accused was involved in 24 criminal cases, out of which three were registered against the accused for murder and two cases of attempting to commit murder and, in all those cases, the accused was charge- sheeted for trial before the court of law. No materials have been produced before us to show that the accused stood convicted in any of those cases. Accused has only been charge-sheeted and not convicted, hence, that factor is not a relevant factor to be taken note of while applying the R-R test so as to award capital punishment. May be, in a given case, the pendency of large number of criminal cases against the accused person might be a factor which could be taken note of in awarding a sentence but, in any case, not a relevant factor for awarding capital punishment. True, when there are more than two dozen cases, of which three relate to the offence of murder, the usual plea of false implication by the defence has to be put on the back seat, and may have an impact on the sentencing policy, since the presence of the accused could be a continuing threat to the society and hence calls for longer period of incarceration.

16. We also notice, while laying down various criteria in determining the aggravating circumstances, two aspects, often seen referred to in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) 2 SCC 684, Machhi Singh and others v. State of Punjab (1983) 3 SCC 470 and Rajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra (2012) 4 SCC 37, are (1) the offences relating to the commission of heinous crime like murder, rape, armed dacoity, kidnapping etc. by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony or offences committed by the person having a substantial history of serious assaults and criminal conviction; and (2) the offence was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another serious offence. First criteria may be a relevant factor while applying the R-R test, provided the offences relating to heinous crimes like murder, rape, dacoity etc. have ended in conviction.

17. We may first examine whether “substantial history of serious assaults and criminal conviction” is an aggravating circumstance when the court is dealing with the offences relating to the heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed docoity etc. Prior record of the conviction, in our view, will be a relevant factor, but that conviction should have attained finality so as to treat it as aggravating circumstance for awarding death sentence. The second aspect deals with a situation where an offence was committed, while the offender was engaged in the commission of another serious offence. This is a situation where the accused is engaged in the commission of another serious offence which has not ended in conviction and attained finality.

18. In the instant case, the Court took the view that there was no probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence and would constitute a continuing threat to the society and there would be no probability that the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated. In Shankar Kisanrao Khade’s case (supra), while dealing with the criminal test (mitigating circumstances), this Court noticed one of the circumstances to be considered by the trial Court, while applying the test, is with regard to the chances of the accused not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated. We find, in several cases, the trial Court while applying the criminal test, without any material on hand, either will hold that there would be no possibility of the accused indulging in commission of crime or that he would indulge in such offences in future and, therefore, it would not be possible to reform or rehabilitate him. Courts used to apply reformative theory in certain minor offences and while convicting persons, the Courts sometimes release the accused on probation in terms of Section 360 Cr.P.C. and Sections 3 and 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. Sections 13 and 14 of the Act provide for appointment of Probation Officers and the nature of duties to be performed. Courts also, while exercising power under Section 4, call for a report from the Probation Officer. In our view, while awarding sentence, in appropriate cases, while hearing the accused under Section 235(2) Cr.P.C., Courts can also call for a report from the Probation Officer, while applying the Crime Test guideline No.3, as laid down in Shankar Kisanrao Khade’s case (supra). Court can then examine whether the accused is likely to indulge in commission of any crime or there is any probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated.

19. We have no doubt in our mind that the accused had the full knowledge, if he fires the shot on the temporal area, that is between the forehead and the ear, it would result in death of the child of one year who was in the arms of PW1. Appellant, of course, demanded Rs.100/- from PW1, which he refused and then he took out the pistol and fired at the right temporal area of the child, as retaliation of not meeting his demand and there is nothing to show that, at the time of the incident, he was under the influence of liquor. Consequently, while affirming the conviction, we are not prepared to say that it is a rarest of rare case, warranting capital punishment. We, therefore, set aside the death sentence awarded by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court, and convert the same to imprisonment for life.

20. We are, however, of the view that this is a fit case where we can apply the principle laid down in Swami Shraddanand (2) alias Murli Manohar Sharma v. State of Karnataka (2008) 13 SCC 767. In that case, this Court took the view that there is a third category of cases in which Court can, while awarding the sentence for imprisonment of life, fix a term of imprisonment of 14 or 20 years (with or without remission) instead of death penalty and can, in appropriate cases, order that the sentences would run consecutively and not concurrently. Above sentencing policy has been adopted by this Court in several cases, since then, the latest being Gurvail Singh v. State of Punjab (2013) 10 SCC 631. We have indicated that this a case where the accused is involved in twenty four criminal cases, of which three are for the offence of murder and two are for attempting to commit murder. In such circumstances, if the appellant is given a lesser punishment and let free, he would be a menace to the society.

21. We are of the view that this is a fit case where 20 years of rigorous imprisonment, without remission, to the appellant, over the period which he has already undergone, would be an adequate sentence and will render substantial justice. Ordered accordingly.",0
"CBI, ACB, MUMBAI","The appellant, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ACB, Mumbai seeks to challenge an order dated 28.10.2005 passed by the High Court of Bombay quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondents Narendra Lal Jain, Jayantilal L. Shah and Ramanlal Lalchand Jain. The aforesaid respondents had moved the High Court under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short “Cr.P.C.”) challenging the orders passed by the learned Trial Court refusing to discharge them and also questioning the continuance of the criminal proceedings registered against them. Of the three accused, Jayantilal L. Shah, the court is informed, has died during the pendency of the present appeal truncating the scope thereof to an adjudication of the correctness of the decision of the High Court in so far as accused Narendra Lal Jain and Ramanlal Lalchand Jain are concerned.

3. On the basis of two FIRs dated 22.03.1993, R.C. No. 21(A) of 1993 and R.C. No.22 (A) of 1993 were registered against the accused-respondents and several officers of the Bank of Maharashtra. The offences alleged were duly investigated and separate chargesheets in the two cases were filed on the basis whereof Special Case No. 15 of 1995 and Special Case No. 20 of 1995 were registered in the Court of the Special Judge, Mumbai. In the chargesheet filed, offences under Sections 120-B/420 IPC and Sections 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 corresponding to Sections 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short “PC Act”) were alleged against the accused persons. In so far as the present accused-respondents are concerned the gravamen of the charge is that they had conspired with the bank officials and had projected inflated figures of the creditworthiness of the companies represented by them and in this manner had secured more advances/loans from the bank than they were entitled to.

4. While the criminal cases were being investigated the bank had instituted suits for recovery of the amounts claimed to be due from the respondents. The said suits were disposed of in terms of consent decrees dated 23.04.2001. Illustratively, the relevant clause of the agreement on the basis of which the consent decrees were passed reads as follows:

“10. Agreed and declared that dispute between the parties hereto were purely and simply of civil nature and on payment mentioned as aforesaid made by the Respondents the Appellants have no grievance of whatsoever nature including of the CBI Complaint against the Respondents.”
5. Applications for discharge were filed by the accused-respondents which were rejected by the learned Trial Court by order dated 04.09.2011. The learned Trial Court, thereafter, proceeded to frame charges against the accused. In so far as the present accused-respondents are concerned charges were framed under Sections 120-B/420 of the Indian Penal Code whereas against the bank officials, charges were framed under the different provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PC Act). The challenge of the respondents to the order of the learned Trial Court refusing discharge and the continuation of the criminal proceedings as a whole having been upheld by the High Court and the proceedings in question having been set aside and quashed in respect of the respondent, the CBI has filed the present appeal challenging the common order of the High Court dated 28.10.2005.

6. We have heard Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellant and Mr. Sushil Karanjkar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 and 4.

7. Shri Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General, has taken us through the order passed by the High Court. He has submitted that the High Court had quashed the criminal proceeding registered against the accused- respondents only on the ground that the civil liability of the respondents had been settled by the consent terms recorded in the decree passed in the suits. Shri Malhotra has submitted that when a criminal offence is plainly disclosed, settlement of the civil liability, though arising from the same facts, cannot be a sufficient justification for the premature termination of the criminal case. Shri Malhotra has also submitted that the offence under Section 120-B alleged against the accused-respondents is not compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C.; so also the offences under the PC Act. Relying on the decision of a three Judges Bench of this Court in Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and Another[1], Shri Malhotra has submitted that though it has been held that the power of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is distinct and different from the power vested in a criminal Court for compounding of offence under Section 320 of the Cr.P.C., it was made clear that the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the offences alleged before proceeding to exercise the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Specifically drawing the attention of the Court to para 61 of the report in Gian Singh (supra) Shri Malhotra has submitted that “any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act…. cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceeding involving such offences”. Shri Malhotra had contended that having regard to the gravity of the offences alleged, which offences are prima facie made out, in as much as charges have been framed for the trial of the accused- respondents, the High Court was not justified in quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused-respondents.

8. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents (accused) have submitted that the High Court, while quashing the criminal proceedings against the respondents (accused), had correctly relied on the judgments of this Court in Central Bureau of Investigation, SPE, SIU(X), New Delhi vs. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., Calcutta[2] and B.S.Joshi and Others vs. State of Haryana and Another[3]. Learned counsel has submitted that though simultaneous criminal and civil action on same set of facts would be maintainable, in Duncans Agro Industries Ltd. (supra) it has been held that the disposal of the civil suit for recovery, on compromise upon receipt of payments by the claimants, would amount to compounding of offence of cheating. No error is, therefore, disclosed in the order of the High Court insofar as the offence under Section 420 IPC is concerned. As for the offence under Section 120-B it is submitted that this Court in B.S. Joshi (supra) has held that the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash a criminal proceeding is not limited by the provisions of Section 320 Cr.P.C. and even if an offence is not compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C., the same would not act as a bar for the exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. As the dispute between the parties have been settled on the terms of the compromise decrees, it is submitted that the High Court had correctly applied the principles laid down in B.S. Joshi (supra) to the facts of the present case.

9. Learned counsel has further pointed out that the charges framed against the accused-respondents are under Section 120-B/420 of the Indian Penal Code and the respondents not being public servants, no substantive offence under the PC Act can be alleged against them. The relevance of the views expressed in para 61 of the judgment of this Court in Gian Singh (supra), noted above, to the present case is seriously disputed by the learned counsel in view of the offences alleged against the respondents. Learned counsel has also submitted that by the very same impugned order of the High Court the criminal proceeding against one Nikhil Merchant was declined to be quashed on the ground that offences under Sections 468 and 471 of the IPC had been alleged against the said accused. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court the accused had moved this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. In the decision reported in Nikhil Merchant vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Another[4] this Court understood the charges/allegations against the aforesaid Nikhil Merchant in the same terms as in the case of the accused-respondents, as already highlighted. Taking into consideration the ratio laid down in B.S. Joshi (supra) and the compromise between the bank and the accused Nikhil Merchant (on the same terms as in the present case) the proceeding against the said accused i.e. Nikhil Merchant was quashed by the Court taking the view that the power and the Section 482 Cr.P.C. and of this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be circumscribed by the provisions of Section 320 Cr.P.C. It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the correctness of the view in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) were referred to the three Judges Bench in Gian Singh (supra). As already noted, the opinion expressed in Gian Singh (supra) is that the power of the High Court to quash a criminal proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is distinct and different from the power vested in a criminal court by Section 320 Cr.P.C. to compound an offence. The conclusion in Gian Singh (supra), therefore, was that the decisions rendered in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) are correct.

10. In the present case, as already seen, the offence with which the accused-respondents had been charged are under Section 120-B/420 of the Indian Penal Code. The civil liability of the respondents to pay the amount to the bank has already been settled amicably. The terms of such settlement have been extracted above. No subsisting grievance of the bank in this regard has been brought to the notice of the Court. While the offence under Section 420 IPC is compoundable the offence under Section 120- B is not. To the latter offence the ratio laid down in B.S. Joshi (supra) and Nikhil Merchant (supra) would apply if the facts of the given case would so justify. The observation in Gian Singh (supra) (para 61) will not be attracted in the present case in view of the offences alleged i.e. under Sections 420/120B IPC.

11. In the present case, having regard to the fact that the liability to make good the monetary loss suffered by the bank had been mutually settled between the parties and the accused had accepted the liability in this regard, the High Court had thought it fit to invoke its power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. We do not see how such exercise of power can be faulted or held to be erroneous. Section 482 of the Code inheres in the High Court the power to make such order as may be considered necessary to, inter alia, prevent the abuse of the process of law or to serve the ends of justice. While it will be wholly unnecessary to revert or refer to the settled position in law with regard to the contours of the power available under Section 482 Cr.P.C. it must be remembered that continuance of a criminal proceeding which is likely to become oppressive or may partake the character of a lame prosecution would be good ground to invoke the extraordinary power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

12. We, therefore, decline to interfere with the impugned order dated 28.10.2005 passed by the High Court and dismiss this appeal. We, however, make it clear that the proceedings in Special Case No. 15/95 and 20/95 stands interfered with by the present order only in respect of accused- respondents Narendra Lal Jain and Ramanlal Lalchand Jain.",0
Nand Kumar,"Six writ petitions were filed before the High Court of Patna which were taken up and disposed of by the High Court by a common order dated December 9, 2009. The High Court rejected the prayer made by the writ petitioners for absorption/regularisation in their posts.

3. The facts of the case, briefly, are as follows:

1. The appellants were appointed on daily wages. It is not in dispute that some of the appellants had also worked as daily wagers for a long period. It is also not in dispute that the services of said daily wagers varied from period to period. Nand Kumar, appellant, was appointed as an Accounts Clerk on daily wage basis on September 18, 1982. Similarly, others (appellants in civil appeals arising out of SLP [C] Nos.8865- 66/2010, 10876/2010, 20833-20835/2010 and 30317/2010) were also appointed, from time to time, and served as daily wagers. It is not in dispute that some of the appellants received monthly salary in the minimum pay scale with usual allowances.

2. In 2006, the State Legislature passed the Bihar Agriculture Produce Market (Repeal) Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the Repeal Act, 2006) with effect from September 1, 2006. As a result whereof, the Bihar Agriculture Produce Market Act, 1960 and rules framed thereunder in the year 1975 stood repealed, save and except certain decisions rendered earlier as well as disciplinary proceedings initiated or pending against its employees were saved. It appears that in these appeals the appellants are not challenging the validity of the Repeal Act. The claim of the appellants is that they have worked on daily wage basis for a long period and cannot be relieved from service by virtue of Section 6 of the Repeal Act, 2006 and, furthermore, such decision is violative of the principles of natural justice and accordingly is arbitrary.

4. A question has also been raised in these appeals whether the daily wage employees are included within the meaning of “all officers and employees” as used in Section 6(i) of the Repeal Act, 2006. The High Court while answering the said question and dealing with the writ petitions, has observed that the said Section under the Repeal Act itself maintains the distinction between the status of daily wage employees and regular employees of the Board.

5. It appears to us that under Section 4 of the said Repeal Act, the assets and liabilities of the Bihar Agriculture Produce Marketing Board or of the Marketing Committees or Bazar Samitis constituted under the Act of 1960, have vested in the State Government. The State Government by virtue of Section 5 of the said Act, has the authority, power and jurisdiction to issue necessary directions and/or orders to secure the object of the Repeal Act, 2006.

6. In the backdrop of the facts of this case, Section 6 is relevant for the purpose of deciding the cases of the appellants and to find out whether it provides for absorption of the daily wagers who worked for a longer period with the Board. It further appears that by virtue of the said Repeal Act, a Committee of Secretaries was constituted under Section 6(ii) and whether the said Committee has the power to prepare a scheme for absorption/regularisation, denying the absorption of the appellants on the ground that they have been appointed by the Board/Market Committee/Bazar Samiti on daily wages or they have a duty to prepare a scheme for such absorption.

7. Now it is necessary for us to reproduce Section 6 of the said Act which reads as follows :

“Section 6: Absorption of officers and employees of Bihar Agriculture Marketing Board/Market Committee/Bazar Samiti. –
i) On and from the date of repeal of the Act, all officers and employees of the Board, shall remain in employment, as if the Act has not been repealed and they shall continue to be paid same salary and allowances as was payable on the date of repeal of the Act till such time State Government has taken such final decision as is provided hereafter.
ii) The State Government shall constitute a committee of Secretaries consisting of three Secretaries who shall prepare detailed scheme of absorption, retirement, compulsory retirement or voluntary retirement, other service conditions of officers and employees of the Board and the Committee. Scheme prepared by group of Secretaries shall be placed before the State Government within two months from the date of enforcement of the present Act. The State Government shall thereafter approve the scheme;
Provided that it shall be open to the State Government to modify, amend or suggest modification or amendment and the scheme thereafter shall be made operational in such form and intent as finally approved by the State Government. Scheme approved by the State Government shall be considered as statutory scheme framed under this Act.
iii) After the scheme approved by the State Government is enforced it shall be fully implemented in its form and intent within three months from the date of its enforcement.
iv) Group of Secretaries constituted under sub-section (ii) above shall be competent to decide utility and deployment of officers and employees of the Board or the Committee during transition period and it shall not be open to any officer or employee to question decision of group of Secretaries.
v) Scheme framed under this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding any other Act, Ordinance, Rule, regulation, direction, order or instruction and condition of service of officers and employees of the Board or the Committee, shall be governed and regulated under the scheme to the extent provision has been made in the scheme.
Provided further that it shall be competent for the State Government to amend, modify, alter or substitute the scheme so framed for removal of difficulties in implementation of the scheme.”
8. Mr. V.Shekhar, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in civil appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 30317/2010 and 30318/2010 has contended that the daily wagers have asked for pay parity with the State employees treating them at par. The appellants claimed to have been working against the posts of Agriculture Produce Marketing Divisions on muster roll basis for the last 5 to 15 years and are in the employment of the Board. He further submitted that the recommendation of the Committee of Secretaries which has decided not to absorb the daily wage employees, is nothing but illegal and malafide. According to him, after working for such a long time and since they have been allowed to draw the pay scale along with usual allowances, would automatically entitle them to the benefit of a regular employee. He further stated that the appellants worked under the duly sanctioned posts. He further drew our attention to the Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. V. Umadevi (3) & Ors. [2006 (4) SCC 1, paras 40, 41 and 53] and submitted that the State should take steps to regularise all these appellants by way of one-time measure.

9. Mr. A. Sharan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in civil appeals arising out of SLP [C] Nos.7555/2010 and 8865-8866/2010, submitted that the appellant has worked in the post for a long time and he should be regularised in the said post since he has already obtained the status of employee working in the Board. He relied upon the judgment reported in State of Karnataka & Ors. v.M.L. Kesari & Ors. [2010 (9) SCC 247].

10. It is further submitted that an advertisement was issued for filling up vacancies by the Board. Some of the petitioners applied for the said post but no steps were taken to fill the said post by the Board. Board issued directions to pay equal pay for equal work to the daily wagers who were working in Grade III and Grade IV. It is also stated that on 27th September, 2006 Executive Engineer, Muzaffarnagar Division Marketing Board sent a report about the strength of the employees in the said division. In the said report, it was also mentioned that Nand Kumar has been working as an accounts clerk from 17th September, 1992 and it has also been mentioned that he will complete his 60 years on 30th September, 2018. Accordingly, it is submitted that the petitioner and similarly situated persons have not been treated as daily wages employees.

11. Our attention has already been drawn by the learned senior counsel to the report of the three Member Committee constituted in terms of section 6(ii) of the Repeal Act which recommended the termination of services of all illegal and irregular employees and was submitted to the Government recommending absorption of only regular employees in para 3.1 and further recommended for termination of daily wagers in para 3.6 of the said report.

12. It is submitted by the appellants that the appellants who have been working for more than 25 years getting regular pay scales and work against the vacant sanctioned posts cannot be treated as ordinary daily wage employees. The provision in the Section 6 of the Repeal Act deals with “all officers and employees” which includes the daily wagers and section 6 of the Repeal Act also provide that all officers of the Board shall remain in employment as if the Act has not been repealed and they would continue on the basis of the regular pay scale, dearness pay and dearness allowances. Therefore, it is submitted by the appellants that the rights of all employees working were adequately protected in the said section 6 of the Repeal Act.

13. It is contended by the appellant that the Committees of Secretaries have wrongly treated the appellant Nand Kumar and similar situated persons as daily wagers without appreciating the facts that they were working in the said post for more than 20-25 years and drawing the salaries in pay scale with dearness allowance. Therefore they cannot be treated differently from regular employees. It is further contended that the term existing employees used in section 6(ii) of the Repeal Act includes all the employees including the petitioners, who were daily wagers. Accordingly, it is submitted that the appellants must get a chance in the matter to be considered by the authorities for absorption/regularization in their posts and cannot be treated differently than that of regular employees.

14. It is further contended by the appellants that the phrase “all officers and employees” in Section 6 of the Repeal Act means all employees without any permutation and combination or without any reservation and qualification. The legislature was fully aware of different types of employees that could be in service like contractual employees, daily wage employees, work charged employees etc. But legislature chooses the expression “all officers and employees”. Sub-section (i) of Section 6 makes clear the legislative intent that the services of “all officers and employees” would continue as if the Principal Act had not been repealed, meaning thereby that there would not be change in service condition of whatsoever till the scheme was finalised as contemplated under section 6(ii) of the Act. Section 6 of the Repeal Act, 2006 provided that all officers and employees of the Board shall remain in employment, as if the Act has not been repealed and they continue on the basis of regular pay scale, dearness pay and dearness allowance. Section 6(ii) of the Repealing Act gives jurisdiction to the Committee to prepare “detailed scheme of absorption, retirement, compulsory retirement or voluntary retirement of existing employees”. The term “existing employees” used in the Act does not distinguish between contractual or regular employee or employees working on sanctioned, vacant post for more than 25 years and getting salary in minimum pay scale and also dearness allowance.

15. The appellant further submitted that the appellants are squarely coming within the purview of Umadevi (supra) and drew our attention to para 53 which reads as follows:

“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in State of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa 1967 (1) SCR 128, R.N.Nanjundappa v. T.Thimmiah 1972 (1) SCC 409 and B.N.Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka 1979 (4) SCC 507 and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for ten years or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. The question of regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”
16. Per contra, it was submitted by counsel appearing on behalf of the State that the words “absorption, retirement, compulsory retirement or voluntary retirement” used in Section 6 of the Repeal Act, 2006 have been used with reference to only the permanent employees of the Board. That absorption in the present case does not mean regularisation. It is further submitted that all the appellants worked on daily wage basis and had not been regularised till the date of repeal of the said Act. It is further submitted that with undoing of the establishment, there is no regulation of the market and as such there is no procurement of revenue. In these circumstances, there cannot be any scope for regularisation. He further pointed out that the daily wagers are engaged in view of work exigencies prevailing in the establishment but in the event of dissolution of the establishment, there cannot be any work exigency. He further submitted that regularisation is not a matter of course, it has to follow the mode of recruitment. The Committee constituted under Section 6 of the Repeal Act duly examined the cases of daily wagers and clause 3.1 of the Resolution prepared by the Market Committee clearly states that any appointment without recommendation or proper authority will be considered as illegal and irregular. It is pointed out that engagement of the appellants was without following any norms and in violation of the rules of recruitment and principles of equality. Accordingly, he submitted that Section 6 of the Repeal Act, 2006 has a provision for protection of permanent employees and not daily wage employees, and such a provision is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The daily wagers constitute a class within themselves and all the daily wagers have been retrenched and not even a single one has been retained in these cases.

17. The High Court dismissed the writ petition which was filed before it on the ground that petitioners cannot claim themselves as a part of same class and the Three Member Committee did not commit any wrong in not recommending absorption of the petitioners.

18. We have also noticed that Constitution Bench of this Court in paras 44, 45 & 47 of Umadevi (supra) held :

“44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work” is different from the concept of conferring permanency on those who have been appointed on ad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no process of selection as envisaged by the rules. This Court has in various decisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal work and has laid down the parameters for the application of that principle. The decisions are rested on the concept of equality enshrined in our Constitution in the light of the directive principles in that behalf. But the acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a position where the court could direct that appointments made without following the due procedure established by law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to treat them as permanent. Doing so, would be negation of the principle of equality of opportunity. The power to make an order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before this Court, would not normally be used for giving the go-by to the procedure established by law in the matter of public employment. Take the situation arising in the cases before us from the State of Karnataka. Therein, after the decision in Dharwad District PWD Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka [1990 (2) SCC 396], the Government had issued repeated directions and mandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc employment or engagement be given. Some of the authorities and departments had ignored those directions or defied those directions and had continued to give employment, specifically interdicted by the orders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing officers have even been punished for their defiance. It would not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 or 32 of the Constitution or in exercise of power under Article 142 of the Constitution permitting those persons engaged, to be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on their appointments or engagements. Complete justice would be justice according to law and though it would be open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court would not grant a relief which would amount to perpetuating an illegality.
45. While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for some time and in some cases for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the person who accepts an engagement either temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He accepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to bargain -- not at arm’s length -- since he might have been searching for some employment so as to eke out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of appointment and to take the view that a person who has temporarily or casually got employed should be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another mode of public appointment which is not permissible. If the court were to void a contractual employment of this nature on the ground that the parties were not having equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the court to grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo on such casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only mean that some people who at least get employment temporarily, contractually or casually, would not be getting even that employment when securing of such employment brings at least some succour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or temporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context that one has to proceed on the basis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even while accepting the employment, the person concerned knows the nature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the procedure established, for making regular appointments to available posts in the services of the State. The argument that since one has been working for some time in the post, it will not be just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of the nature of the employment when he first took it up, is not one that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure established by law for public employment and would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.
x x x x x
47. When a person enters a temporary employment or gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the engagement is not based on a proper selection as recognized by the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could be made only by following a proper procedure for selection and in cases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State has held out any promise while engaging these persons either to continue them where they are or to make them permanent. The State cannot constitutionally make such a promise. It is also obvious that the theory cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of being made permanent in the post.”
19. Therefore, considering the facts of the present case, it appears to us that the appellants were never appointed through a proper procedure. It is not in dispute that they all served as daily wagers. Therefore, it was within their knowledge all the consequences of appointment being temporary, they cannot have even a right to invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post. Accordingly, we cannot accept the contention of the appellants in the matter. We have further considered the case of the appellants in the light of Section 6 of the Repeal Act which has made it clear that the employees of the Board and the appellants cannot be said to be of the same status and cannot enjoy the benefit given under Section 6(i) of the Repeal Act, 2006. Therefore, we are unable to accept the contention that the daily wagers would also come within the meaning of “all officers and employees” as specifically stated in Section 6 of the Repeal Act. In these circumstances, we are unable to accept the submission of learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants.

We have also considered the decision in M.L.Kesari (supra) of this Court which deals with the exception contained in para 53 of Umadevi (supra) but considering the facts of this case, we do not have any hesitation to hold that the said decisions can not be a help to the appellants.

20. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the records placed before us. We find that the status of the appellants was continuing to be as daily wagers. They cannot be treated as permanent Government employees. They all worked as employees of the Board. We have also found that no steps were followed by the Board to safeguard the service of these appellants. We have not been able to find out whether any advertisement was issued by the Government to regularise them. In these circumstances, in view of the submission which has been advanced on behalf of the appellants, we do not find that there is any substance in the matter/arguments put forwarded before us on behalf of the appellants as we have been able to find out that the appellants have served as daily wagers and we do find that Section 6(i) makes it clear that after the repeal of the Agriculture Produce Act, 1960, all officers and employees of the Board are to continue in employment and they shall continue to be paid what they were getting earlier as salary and allowance till such time the State Government takes an official decision as per the further provisions of Section 6. Such provision certainly allows continuance of the officers and employees of the Board to continue in employment in the same status. The status of the daily wage employees and regular employees of the Board is eminent from the said provision. It cannot be said that the status of the daily wage employees can enjoy or acquire the same status as that of the regular employees. In these circumstances, we do not find that there was any discrimination between the daily wage employees and the regular employees as is tried to be contended before us. Therefore, such submission has no substance, in our opinion, for the reason that the difference continues and is recognised under the said provision of the Repeal Act. So far as the power of the Committee of Secretaries constituted in terms of section 6(ii) of the Repeal Act is concerned, it is to prepare a scheme of absorption as well as of retirement, compulsory retirement or voluntary retirement and other service conditions of officers and employees of the Board. In our opinion, the scheme which was prepared by the Committee of Secretaries is only in the nature of recommendation and the State has the power either to accept, modify or amend the same before granting its official approval. Therefore, after the sanction is granted by the Government in respect of the said scheme, it would gain the status of statutory scheme framed under the said Act and would be enforced within the time to be indicated in section 6(iii) of the Repeal Act, 2006.

21. Therefore, in the light of the said provision, we do not find that the Committee of Secretaries can be faulted in treating the daily wage employees on a different footing and deciding for removal of their services.

22. We have consciously noted the aforesaid decisions of this Court. The principle as has been laid down in Umadevi (supra) has also been applied in relation to the persons who were working on daily wages. According to us, the daily wagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the term ‘appointment’. They do not hold a post. The scheme of alternative appointment framed for regular employees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore, confer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of abolished organisation to such alternative employment. [See Avas Vikas Sansthan v. Avas Vikas Sansthan Engineers Association (2006 (4) SCC 132)]. Their relevance in the context of appointment arose by reason of the concept of regularisation as a source of appointment. After Umadevi (supra), their position continued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on daily wage basis is not an appointment to a post according to the rules. Usually, the projects in which the daily wagers were engaged, having come to an end, their appointment is necessarily terminated for want of work. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers of a Government concern are not equivalent to that of a Government servant and his claim to permanency has to be adjudged differently.

23. In these circumstances, in our considered opinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter of course. It would depend upon the facts of the case following the rules and regulations and cannot be de hors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.

24. Accordingly, we do not find any substance with regard to the arguments advanced before us on behalf of the appellants. We do not find any merit in the appeals. Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the High Court and affirm the same, dismissing these appeals",0
SANJAY KUMAR SHUKLA,"These appeals are directed against the common judgment and order dated 16.05.2012 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Letters Patent Appeal Nos.1845 and 1916 of 2011. By the aforesaid impugned order, the High Court has directed that the respondent No.7 herein who was placed at serial No.2 of the select list/merit panel for award of dealership of retail outlet under the respondent No.1, i.e. M/s. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd., be offered the said dealership after completing the process contemplated under the selection procedure in force in the Corporation.

3. A summary of the essential facts is delineated hereinbelow:-

The first respondent Corporation issued an advertisement dated 30.05.2010 for award of dealership of retail outlets in different locations including Areraj, East Champaran District in the State of Bihar. The selection was to be made in accordance with the norms laid down by the Corporation and available in a booklet published on 15.09.2008 under the caption “procedure for selection of petrol/diesel retail outlet dealers” (hereinafter referred to as the “Norms”). On the basis of the applications received for grant of the dealership in question, a selection was held wherein the appellant was placed at Sl.No.1 with 78.04 marks whereas the respondent No.7 who had secured 77.75 marks was placed at Sl.No.2. The dealership was to be offered to the most meritorious candidate after necessary field verification. The norms contemplated issuance of a Letter of Intent (LoI) on the expiry of 30 days from the date of publication of the select list/merit panel or till disposal of complaints, if any, with regard to the selection made by the Corporation. A grievance redressal mechanism is expressly laid down in the ‘Norms’.

4. Aggrieved by the selection, the respondent No.7 filed a complaint dated 25.01.2011 before the Corporation raising a two-fold grievance. The first was with regard to award of ‘zero’ marks to the Respondent, against a maximum of ‘four’ awardable under the head “Fixed and Moveable Assets”. The second grievance raised was that the land offered by the appellant was under litigation and was not immediately available for use of the retail outlet. The complaint filed by the respondent No.7 was promptly answered by an order of rejection dated 28.01.2011 on the ground that the Technical Evaluation Committee in its report had found the land offered by the appellant suitable for development of the retail outlet and that the issue raised by the respondent in the objection/complaint would be dealt with in the process of grant of No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the District Magistrate to whom a reference of the matter is required to be made. In so far as the claim of the respondent No.7 with regard to award of marks is concerned, the same was rejected on the ground that the respondent had not furnished any document in support of his title to the assets mentioned by him in his application.

5. Aggrieved by the rejection of his complaint, the respondent No.7 moved the High Court by means of a writ petition registered and numbered as C.W.J.C. No.6125 of 2011. No Letter of Intent had been granted to the appellant at that stage. A learned Single Judge of the High Court by order dated 29.09.2011 took the view that in so far as award of marks to the respondent No.7 is concerned no fault can be found in the decision of the Corporation inasmuch as the respondent No.7 did not produce any document of title in respect of assets mentioned by him in his application for the dealership. In fact, the learned Single Judge came to the further conclusion that such failure on the part of the respondent No.7 amounted to suppression/concealment of relevant facts. In so far as the present appellant is concerned, the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the requisite NOC from the District Magistrate in respect of the land offered by the appellant not having been granted, the Corporation cannot be expected to wait indefinitely. Consequently, the learned Single Judge directed that the selection process be redone.

6. Aggrieved by the order dated 29.09.2011 passed by the learned Single Judge both the appellant and the respondent No.7 filed their respective Letters Patent Appeals. The Division Bench of the High Court by the impugned order dated 16.05.2012 substantially agreed with the findings recorded by the learned Single Judge in so far as both the parties are concerned. However, taking note of Clause 16 of the Norms i.e. “Procedure For Selection Of Petrol/Diesel Retail Outlet Dealers”, the Bench took the view that once the appellant was found to be disentitled, the dealership should have been awarded to respondent No.7, he being, at serial No.2 of the merit list. Consequential directions were issued by the Division Bench of the High Court. Aggrieved, the present appeals have been filed.

7. Contending that the findings of the learned Single Judge with regard to suppression/concealment had not been set aside by the Division Bench of the High Court in its order dated 16.05.2012, the respondent No.7 had moved SLP (C) No.28324 of 2012 against the aforesaid part of the order dated 16.05.2012. The SLP filed by the respondent No.7 was dismissed by this Court by order dated 05.10.2012.

8. An effective resolution of the contentious issues that have emerged from the arguments made on behalf of the rival parties would require specific notice of the relevant documents brought on record by the parties at different stages of the proceedings before the High Court as well as this Court. As none of the said documents are disputed and the authenticity/genuineness thereof is not questioned, considering the relevance of the same to the subject matter, we are of the view that the facts unfolded by the said documents can be ignored only at the cost of a fair adjudication of the lis between the parties. We, therefore, proceed to take note of the said facts in proper sequential order.

9. After the selection for the dealership was finalized by the Corporation on 30.12.2010, a reference was made to the District Authority on 24.01.2011 for grant of NOC to enable the Corporation to apply for the necessary licence under the Petroleum Rules, 2002. By communications dated 11.07.2011 and 16.07.2011 the District Authority informed the Corporation that NOC cannot be granted on account of the fact that the land, on which outlet was proposed, was involved in Partition Suit No.7 of 2006. It would be of some significance that the appellant was impleaded as defendant in the said suit on 04.02.2011 i.e. after 5 years of its institution and that too after the finalization of the select list/merit panel by the Corporation. An order of injunction to restrain the District Authority from issuing NOC was sought by the plaintiff in Partition Suit No.7 of 2006 which was refused by the learned Trial Court on 19.07.2011. Taking note of the aforesaid fact i.e. refusal of injunction, the District Authority, once again, sought for a report from the Sub-Divisional Officer whether NOC can be granted. This was on 04.08.2011. The Sub-Divisional Officer sought the opinion of the Government Advocate and submitted a report dated 18.08.2011 recommending grant of NOC. These documents, though vital, were not before the High Court but have been placed before us. After the learned Single Judge had decided the writ petition by ordering a fresh selection, an amendment application dated 17.10.2011 was filed in Partition Suit No.7 of 2006 for deletion of the land offered for the dealership from the purview of the suit. The said amendment was allowed by the learned Trial Court on 19.10.2011. In the L.P.A. filed by the appellant, i.e. L.P.A. No.1845 of 2011 the amendment application for deletion of the land in question as well as the order dated 19.10.2011 of the learned Trial Court allowing the said amendment application were enclosed. The High Court overlooked the same and did not consider the effect thereof on the rights and entitlements of the respective parties. It also appears that on 26.12.2011, on behalf of the Corporation, a reminder was issued to the District Authority for grant of the NOC applied for by the Corporation on 24.01.2011. There is another letter on record dated 30.12.2011 from the District Magistrate to the Territory Manager (Retail) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited in the matter of grant of NOC. In the said letter reference has been made to the order of the learned Single Judge in the C.W.J.C. No.6125 of 2011 dated 29.09.2011. In the ultimate paragraph of the said letter it is stated that:-

“Thus, in view of the present context, kindly inform about your final decision regarding issuance of NOC whether issuance of NOC can be considered or not.” The aforesaid letter dated 30.12.2011 is an English translation of the original. The contents of the last paragraph quoted hereinabove has left the true meaning thereof clouded though the appellant contends that the said paragraph should be read as containing a query from the Corporation as to whether in view of the learned Single Judge’s order passed in the writ petition, NOC can be issued or not. Be that as it may, another suit i.e. T.S.No.638 of 2011 involving land in question had been instituted though the same has been dismissed on 6.1.2014 as not maintainable. Above all, Partition Suit No.7 of 2006 has been dismissed as withdrawn on 7.1.2014 on an application filed by the plaintiff. No other pending litigation involving the land has been brought to the notice of the Court.
10. In the present case even before the Letter of Intent in respect of the dealership could be issued to the appellant the proposed grant came to be challenged before the High Court by the respondent No.7 who had impugned the decision of the Corporation dated 28.01.2011 rejecting the complaint filed by him against the selection made. Initially, the District Authority had taken the stand that the NOC in respect of the land offered by the appellant cannot be issued as the same was found to be involved in a litigation i.e. Partition Suit No.7 of 2006. While the writ petition was pending there was a change in the stand of the District Authority in the matter of grant of NOC. Yet, the same was not brought to the notice of the learned Single Judge. A vital fact, therefore, escaped notice. The fact that the appellant was impleaded in the suit on 04.02.2011, i.e. nearly 5 years after the institution thereof and after the selection was finalized by the Corporation on 30.12.2010 was before the High Court; yet the same had been overlooked by the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench hearing the Letters Patent Appeals also overlooked the fact that the learned Trial Court by order dated 19.10.2011 had allowed the deletion of the land in question from the purview of the said partition suit on an application filed by the plaintiff. This is, notwithstanding, the fact that the amendment application dated 17.10.2011 as well as the order thereon dated 19.10.2011 was brought on the record of the L.P.A. by the appellant. That apart, the facts brought on record of the present appeal by the parties is of considerable significance. The subsequent report of the Sub-Divisional Officer dated 18.8.2011 recommending grant of NOC; the reminder of the Corporation dated 26.12.2011 to the District Authority for grant of NOC; the institution of Title Suit No.638 of 2011 in respect of the land in question and the dismissal thereof by order dated 06.01.2014 on the ground of maintainability as well as the dismissal of Partition Suit No.7 of 2006 on 07.01.2014 (on withdrawal) are too significant to be ignored, as already held. Relevant facts have been ignored at different stages of consideration of the matter by the High Court and in the light of the totality of the facts now placed before us, we unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that in the present case there was a deliberate and not very bona fide attempt on the part of the respondent No.7 to deny the fruit of the selection made in favour of the appellant by the Corporation as far back as on 30.12.2010. The situation, therefore, has to be remedied and it is the precise manner thereof which must now engage the attention of the Court.

11. We cannot help observing that in the present case exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction vested in the High Court by Article 226 of the Constitution has been with a somewhat free hand oblivious of the note of caution struck by this Court with regard to such exercise, particularly, in contractual matters. The present, therefore, may be an appropriate occasion to recall some of the observations of this Court in the above context. In Raunaq International Ltd. Vs. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. & Ors.[1], (paragraphs 9, 10 and 11) this Court had held as follows :-

“9. The award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision, considerations which are of paramount importance are commercial considerations. These would be:
(1) the price at which the other side is willing to do the work;
(2) whether the goods or services offered are of the requisite specifications;
(3) whether the person tendering has the ability to deliver the goods or services as per specifications. When large works contracts involving engagement of substantial manpower or requiring specific skills are to be offered, the financial ability of the tenderer to fulfil the requirements of the job is also important;
(4) the ability of the tenderer to deliver goods or services or to do the work of the requisite standard and quality;
(5) past experience of the tenderer and whether he has successfully completed similar work earlier;
(6) time which will be taken to deliver the goods or services; and often (7) the ability of the tenderer to take follow-up action, rectify defects or to give post-contract services.
Even when the State or a public body enters into a commercial transaction, considerations which would prevail in its decision to award the contract to a given party would be the same. However, because the State or a public body or an agency of the State enters into such a contract, there could be, in a given case, an element of public law or public interest involved even in such a commercial transaction.
10. What are these elements of public interest? (1) Public money would be expended for the purposes of the contract. (2) The goods or services which are being commissioned could be for a public purpose, such as, construction of roads, public buildings, power plants or other public utilities. (3) The public would be directly interested in the timely fulfilment of the contract so that the services become available to the public expeditiously. (4) The public would also be interested in the quality of the work undertaken or goods supplied by the tenderer. Poor quality of work or goods can lead to tremendous public hardship and substantial financial outlay either in correcting mistakes or in rectifying defects or even at times in redoing the entire work — thus involving larger outlays of public money and delaying the availability of services, facilities or goods, e.g., a delay in [pic]commissioning a power project, as in the present case, could lead to power shortages, retardation of industrial development, hardship to the general public and substantial cost escalation.
11. When a writ petition is filed in the High Court challenging the award of a contract by a public authority or the State, the court must be satisfied that there is some element of public interest involved in entertaining such a petition. If, for example, the dispute is purely between two tenderers, the court must be very careful to see if there is any element of public interest involved in the litigation. A mere difference in the prices offered by the two tenderers may or may not be decisive in deciding whether any public interest is involved in intervening in such a commercial transaction. It is important to bear in mind that by court intervention, the proposed project may be considerably delayed thus escalating the cost far more than any saving which the court would ultimately effect in public money by deciding the dispute in favour of one tenderer or the other tenderer. Therefore, unless the court is satisfied that there is a substantial amount of public interest, or the transaction is entered into mala fide, the court should not intervene under Article 226 in disputes between two rival tenderers.”
12. In Air India Ltd. Vs. Cochin International Airport Ltd. & Ors.[2], there was a further reiteration of the said principle in the following terms:-

“7. The law relating to award of a contract by the State, its corporations and bodies acting as instrumentalities and agencies of the Government has been settled by the decision of this Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India[3], Fertilizer Corpn. Kamgar Union (Regd.) v. Union of India[4], CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd.[5], Tata Cellular v. Union of India[6], Ramniklal N. Bhutta v. State of Maharashtra[7] and Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction Ltd.[8] The award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial decision considerations which are paramount are commercial considerations. The State can choose its own method to arrive at a decision. It can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter into negotiations before finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it. Price need not always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract. It is free to grant any relaxation, for bona fide reasons, if the tender conditions permit such a relaxation. It may not accept the offer even though it happens to be the highest or the lowest. But the State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies are bound to adhere to the norms, standards and procedures laid down by them and cannot depart from them arbitrarily. Though that decision is not amenable to judicial review, the court can examine the decision-making process and interfere if it is found vitiated by mala fides, unreasonableness and arbitrariness. The State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies have the public duty to be fair to all concerned. Even when some defect is found in the decision-making process the court must exercise its discretionary power under Article 226 with great caution and should exercise it only in furtherance of public interest and not merely on the making out of a legal point. The court should always keep the larger public interest in mind in order to decide whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when it comes to a conclusion that overwhelming public interest requires interference, the court should intervene.” (Emphasis is ours)
13. Similar reiteration is to be found in Master Marine Services (P) Ltd. Vs. Metcalfe & Hodgkinson (P) Ltd. & Anr.[9]; Tejas Constructions and Infrastructure Private Limited Vs. Municipal Council, Sendhwa and Another[10] and several other pronouncements reference to which would only be repetitive and, therefore, is best avoided.

14. We have felt it necessary to reiterate the need of caution sounded by this Court in the decisions referred to hereinabove in view of the serious consequences that the entertainment of a writ petition in contractual matters, unless justified by public interest, can entail. Delay in the judicial process that seems to have become inevitable could work in different ways. Deprivation of the benefit of a service or facility to the public; escalating costs burdening the public exchequer and abandonment of half completed works and projects due to the ground realities in a fast changing economic/market scenario are some of the pitfalls that may occur.

15. In the present case, fortunately, the litigation has not been very time consuming. Nothing has been suggested on behalf of the Corporation that the establishment of a retail outlet at Areraj, East Champaran District in the State of Bihar is not required as on date. It can, therefore, be safely understood that in the instant case the public of the locality have been deprived of the benefit of the service that the outlet could have generated. We have already indicated that the present litigation initiated by Respondent No. 7 does not constitute a very bonafide exercise on the part of the said Respondent and the entire litigation appears to have been driven by desire to deny the fruits of the selection in which the appellant was found to be the most eligible candidate. Whether the outlet is operated by the appellant or the Respondent No. 7 is of no consequence to the ultimate beneficiaries of the service to be offered by the said outlet. The above highlights the need of caution that was imperative on the part of the High Court while entertaining the writ petition and in passing orders therein. Be that as it may, in the totality of the facts of the present case, we are of the view that it would be just and proper to direct the Corporation, if it is of the view that the operation of the retail outlet is still justified by the exigencies, to award the same to the appellant by completing the requisite formalities in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Corporation itself.

16. Consequently, these appeals are allowed and the impugned order dated 16.05.2012 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in L.P.A. Nos.1845 and 1916 of 2011 as well as the order dated 29.09.2011 passed by learned Single Judge in C.W.J.C. No.6125 of 2011 are set aside",0
SHABNAM HASHMI,". Recognition of the right to adopt and to be adopted as a fundamental right under Part-III of the Constitution is the vision scripted by the public spirited individual who has moved this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. There is an alternative prayer requesting the Court to lay down optional guidelines enabling adoption of children by persons irrespective of religion, caste, creed etc. and further for a direction to the respondent Union of India to enact an optional law the prime focus of which is the child with considerations like religion etc. taking a hind seat.

2. The aforesaid alternative prayer made in the writ petition appears to have been substantially fructified by the march that has taken place in this sphere of law, gently nudged by the judicial verdict in Lakshmi Kant Pandey Vs. Union of India[1] and the supplemental, if not consequential, legislative innovations in the shape of the Juvenile Justice (Care And Protection of Children) Act, 2000 as amended in 2006 (hereinafter for short ‘the JJ Act, 2000) as also The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules promulgated in the year 2007 (hereinafter for short ‘the JJ Rules, 2007’).

3. The alternative prayer made in the writ petition may be conveniently dealt with at the outset.

The decision of this Court in Lakshmi Kant Pandey (supra) is a high watermark in the development of the law relating to adoption. Dealing with inter-country adoptions, elaborate guidelines had been laid by this Court to protect and further the interest of the child. A regulatory body, i.e., Central Adoption Resource Agency (for short ‘CARA’) was recommended for creation and accordingly set up by the Government of India in the year 1989. Since then, the said body has been playing a pivotal role, laying down norms both substantive and procedural, in the matter of inter as well as in country adoptions. The said norms have received statutory recognition on being notified by the Central Govt. under Rule 33 (2) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007 and are today in force throughout the country, having also been adopted and notified by several states under the Rules framed by the states in exercise of the Rule making power under Section 68 of the JJ Act, 2000.

4. A brief outline of the statutory developments in the concerned sphere may now be sketched.

In stark contrast to the provisions of the JJ Act, 2000 in force as on date, the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 (hereinafter for short ‘the JJ Act, 1986’) dealt with only “neglected” and “delinquent juveniles”. While the provisions of the 1986 Act dealing with delinquent juveniles are not relevant for the present, all that was contemplated for a ‘neglected juvenile’ is custody in a juvenile home or an order placing such a juvenile under the care of a parent, guardian or other person who was willing to ensure his good behaviour during the period of observation as fixed by the Juvenile Welfare Board. The JJ Act, 2000 introduced a separate chapter i.e. Chapter IV under the head ‘Rehabilitation and Social Reintegration’ for a child in need of care and protection. Such rehabilitation and social reintegration was to be carried out alternatively by adoption or foster care or sponsorship or by sending the child to an after-care organization. Section 41 contemplates adoption though it makes it clear that the primary responsibility for providing care and protection to a child is his immediate family. Sections 42, 43 and 44 of the JJ Act, 2000 deals with alternative methods of rehabilitation namely, foster care, sponsorship and being looked after by an after-care organisation.

5. The JJ Act, 2000, however did not define ‘adoption’ and it is only by the amendment of 2006 that the meaning thereof came to be expressed in the following terms:

“2(aa)-“adoption” means the process through which the adopted child is permanently separated from his biological parents and become the legitimate child of his adoptive parents with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities that are attached to the relationship”
6. In fact, Section 41 of the JJ Act, 2000 was substantially amended in 2006 and for the first time the responsibility of giving in adoption was cast upon the Court which was defined by the JJ Rules, 2007 to mean a civil court having jurisdiction in matters of adoption and guardianship including the court of the district judge, family courts and the city civil court. [Rule 33 (5)] Substantial changes were made in the other sub-sections of Section 41 of the JJ Act, 2000. The CARA, as an institution, received statutory recognition and so did the guidelines framed by it and notified by the Central Govt. [Section 41(3)].

7. In exercise of the rule making power vested by Section 68 of the JJ Act, 2000, the JJ Rules, 2007 have been enacted. Chapter V of the said Rules deal with rehabilitation and social reintegration. Under Rule 33(2) guidelines issued by the CARA, as notified by the Central Government under Section 41 (3) of the JJ Act, 2000, were made applicable to all matters relating to adoption. It appears that pursuant to the JJ Rules, 2007 and in exercise of the rule making power vested by the JJ Act, 2000 most of the States have followed suit and adopted the guidelines issued by CARA making the same applicable in the matter of adoption within the territorial boundaries of the concerned State.

Rules 33(3) and 33(4) of the JJ Rules, 2007 contain elaborate provisions regulating pre-adoption procedure i.e. for declaring a child legally free for adoption. The Rules also provide for foster care (including pre-adoption foster care) of such children who cannot be placed in adoption & lays down criteria for selection of families for foster care, for sponsorship and for being looked after by an aftercare organisation. Whatever the Rules do not provide for are supplemented by the CARA guidelines of 2011 which additionally provide measures for post adoption follow up and maintenance of data of adoptions.

8. It will now be relevant to take note of the stand of the Union of India. Way back on 15th May, 2006 the Union in its counter affidavit had informed the Court that prospective parents, irrespective of their religious background, are free to access the provisions of the Act for adoption of children after following the procedure prescribed. The progress on the ground as laid before the Court by the Union of India through the Ministry of Women and Child Development (respondent No. 3 herein) may also be noticed at this stage. The Union in its written submission before the Court has highlighted that at the end of the calendar year 2013 Child Welfare Committees (CWC) are presently functioning in a total of 619 districts of the country whereas State Adoption Resource Agencies (SARA) has been set up in 26 States/Union Territories; Adoption Recommendation Committees (ARCs) have been constituted in 18 States/Union Territories whereas the number of recognized adoption organisations in the country are 395. According to the Union the number of reported adoptions in the country from January, 2013 to September, 2013 was 19884 out of which 1712 cases are of inter-country adoption. The third respondent has also drawn the attention of the Court that notwithstanding the time schedule specified in the guidelines of 2011 as well as in the JJ Rules, 2007 there is undue delay in processing of adoption cases at the level of Child Welfare Committees (CWS), the Adoption Recommendation Committees (ARCs) as well as the concerned courts.

9. In the light of the aforesaid developments, the petitioner in his written submission before the Court, admits that the JJ Act, 2000 is a secular law enabling any person, irrespective of the religion he professes, to take a child in adoption. It is akin to the Special Marriage Act 1954, which enables any person living in India to get married under that Act, irrespective of the religion he follows. JJA 2000 with regard to adoption is an enabling optional gender-just law, it is submitted. In the written arguments filed on behalf of the petitioner it has also been stated that in view of the enactment of the JJ Act, 2000 and the Amending Act of 2006 the prayers made in the writ petition with regard to guidelines to enable and facilitate adoption of children by persons irrespective of religion, caste, creed etc. stands satisfactorily answered and that a direction be made by this Court to all States, Union Territories and authorities under the JJ Act, 2000 to implement the provisions of Section 41 of the Act and to follow the CARA guidelines as notified.

10. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Board’) which has been allowed to intervene in the present proceeding has filed a detailed written submission wherein it has been contended that under the JJ Act, 2000 adoption is only one of the methods contemplated for taking care of a child in need of care and protection and that Section 41 explicitly recognizes foster care, sponsorship and being look after by after-care organizations as other/ alternative modes of taking care of an abandoned/surrendered child. It is contended that Islamic Law does not recognize an adopted child to be at par with a biological child. According to the Board, Islamic Law professes what is known as the “Kafala” system under which the child is placed under a ‘Kafil’ who provides for the well being of the child including financial support and thus is legally allowed to take care of the child though the child remains the true descendant of his biological parents and not that of the “adoptive” parents. The Board contends that the “Kafala” system which is recognized by the United Nation’s Convention of the Rights of the Child under Article 20(3) is one of the alternate system of child care contemplated by the JJ Act, 2000 and therefore a direction should be issued to all the Child Welfare Committees to keep in mind and follow the principles of Islamic Law before declaring a muslim child available for adoption under Section 41(5) of the JJ Act, 2000.

11. The JJ Act, 2000, as amended, is an enabling legislation that gives a prospective parent the option of adopting an eligible child by following the procedure prescribed by the Act, Rules and the CARA guidelines, as notified under the Act. The Act does not mandate any compulsive action by any prospective parent leaving such person with the liberty of accessing the provisions of the Act, if he so desires. Such a person is always free to adopt or choose not to do so and, instead, follow what he comprehends to be the dictates of the personal law applicable to him. To us, the Act is a small step in reaching the goal enshrined by Article 44 of the Constitution. Personal beliefs and faiths, though must be honoured, cannot dictate the operation of the provisions of an enabling statute. At the cost of repetition we would like to say that an optional legislation that does not contain an unavoidable imperative cannot be stultified by principles of personal law which, however, would always continue to govern any person who chooses to so submit himself until such time that the vision of a uniform Civil Code is achieved. The same can only happen by the collective decision of the generation(s) to come to sink conflicting faiths and beliefs that are still active as on date.

12. The writ petitioner has also prayed for a declaration that the right of a child to be adopted and that of the prospective parents to adopt be declared a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Reliance is placed in this regard on the views of the Bombay and Kerala High Courts in In re: Manuel Theodore D’souza[2] and Philips Alfred Malvin Vs. Y.J.Gonsalvis & Ors.[3] respectively. The Board objects to such a declaration on the grounds already been noticed, namely, that Muslim Personal Law does not recognize adoption though it does not prohibit a childless couple from taking care and protecting a child with material and emotional support.

13. Even though no serious or substantial debate has been made on behalf of the petitioner on the issue, abundant literature including the holy scripts have been placed before the Court by the Board in support of its contention, noted above. Though enriched by the lengthy discourse laid before us, we do not think it necessary to go into any of the issues raised. The Fundamental Rights embodied in Part-III of the Constitution constitute the basic human rights which inhere in every person and such other rights which are fundamental to the dignity and well being of citizens. While it is correct that the dimensions and perspectives of the meaning and content of fundamental rights are in a process of constant evolution as is bound to happen in a vibrant democracy where the mind is always free, elevation of the right to adopt or to be adopted to the status of a Fundamental Right, in our considered view, will have to await a dissipation of the conflicting thought processes in this sphere of practices and belief prevailing in the country. The legislature which is better equipped to comprehend the mental preparedness of the entire citizenry to think unitedly on the issue has expressed its view, for the present, by the enactment of the JJ Act 2000 and the same must receive due respect. Conflicting view points prevailing between different communities, as on date, on the subject makes the vision contemplated by Article 44 of the Constitution i.e. a Uniform Civil Code a goal yet to be fully reached and the Court is reminded of the anxiety expressed by it earlier with regard to the necessity to maintain restraint. All these impel us to take the view that the present is not an appropriate time and stage where the right to adopt and the right to be adopted can be raised to the status of a fundamental right and/or to understand such a right to be encompassed by Article 21 of the Constitution. In this regard we would like to observe that the decisions of the Bombay High Court in Manuel Theodore D’souza (supra) and the Kerala High Court in Philips Alfred Malvin (supra) can be best understood to have been rendered in the facts of the respective cases. While the larger question i.e. qua Fundamental Rights was not directly in issue before the Kerala High Court, in Manuel Theodore D’souza (supra) the right to adopt was consistent with the canonical law applicable to the parties who were Christians by faith. We hardly need to reiterate the well settled principles of judicial restraint, the fundamental of which requires the Court not to deal with issues of Constitutional interpretation unless such an exercise is but unavoidable.

14. Consequently, the writ petition is disposed of in terms of our directions and observations made above.",0
Vijay Kumar,"The appellant Dr. Atma Ram in Criminal Appeal No.1363 of 2009 is the accused No.1 and the appellant Vijay Kumar in Criminal Appeal No.441 of 2009 is accused No.3 in the Sessions Case No.28 of 2001 (38/1986) on the file of Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track) Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan and they were tried for the alleged offences under Section 120B, 302, 460 and 382 IPC. Three other accused namely A-2 Kailash Chand, A-4 Gyanchand and A-5 Radha Devi were also tried in the same case for the alleged offence under Section 411 IPC. The Sessions Court found accused Nos. 1 and 3/appellants guilty of the charges framed and sentenced them each to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/- each in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each for the offence under Section 302 read with Section 120B IPC and further sentenced them each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for eight years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- each and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each for the offence under Section 460 IPC and also sentenced them each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for eight years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- each and in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each for the offence under Section 382 IPC and ordered the sentences to run concurrently. The Sessions Court also found accused Nos.2, 4 and 5 guilty of the offence under Section 411 IPC and sentenced them each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and each to pay a fine of Rs.500 and in default each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months.

3. Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence accused Nos.1 to 5 preferred appeal in Criminal Appeal No.664 of 2001 and the High Court by judgment dated 2.5.2007 dismissed the appeal preferred by the accused No.1 Atma Ram and accused No.3 Vijay Kumar/appellants herein and at the same time allowed the appeal pertaining to accused No.2 Kailash Chand, A-4 Gyan Chand and Accused No.5 Radha Devi and acquitted them of charge under Section 411 IPC. Challenging their conviction and sentence accused No.1 Atma Ram and accused No.3 Vijay Kumar have preferred the present appeals.

4. Briefly the case of the prosecution is as follows:

Accused No.1 Atma Ram was working as a Doctor in the Government Hospital in village Chhapoli and Keshar Bai was posted as a mid-wife in the same hospital and a month prior to occurrence she started residing in a room on the ground floor under the stair- case of the hospital. She used to give loan on interest on the mortgage of gold and silver ornaments. PW 17 Sweeper Basanti Lal was also residing in a corner room on the ground floor of the hospital. A-1 Atma Ram was residing on the first floor of the same hospital. Accused No.3 Vijay Kumar was his brother-in-law and he was also residing with him. On 11.11.1985 PW 17 Basanti Lal noticed Kesar Bai sitting outside in the hospital and also noticed return of Atma Ram to Hospital. Dr.Atma Ram forwarded a written report on November 12, 1985 through Peon Nand Lal to Udaipurbati Police Station (Jhunjhunu) informing about the murder of Keshar Bai. In the report A-1 Atma Ram stated that in the preceding night around 12.30 a.m. he suddenly woke-up hearing voice of sweeper Basanti Lal who was asking to open the door of his room which was bolted from outside. Atma Ram then got up and proceeded towards the room of Basanti Lal but the door of Atma Ram’s staircase was also bolted from outside, therefore he could not go out and awoke Vijay Kumar, who was residing with him. Vijay Kumar then scaled the roof and unbolted the room of Basanti Lal. Thereafter all the three went down through the staircase and went towards Nohra. They found the room of Keshar Bai open. They called Keshar Bai, but she did not respond. Therefore they entered inside the room and saw Keshar Bai lying dead in naked condition in a pool of blood. Her mouth was tied with saree. On her legs a box was lying open. Based on the report a case under Exh.P.13 First Information Report came to be registered under Section 302 and 460 IPC and the investigation commenced. After some time the investigation was transferred to CID (CB) Jaipur. PW 85 Investigation Officer Shiv Prasad Sharma arrested A-1 Atma Ram on 9.4.1986 and on inquiry A-1 Atma Ram gave Exh.P105 information leading to recovery of ornaments under Exh.P8 list. Pursuant to his further information given under Exh. P106 one knife and screw driver came to be recovered under Exh.P.30. PW 85 Investigation Officer Shiv Prasad Sharma arrested A-3 Vijay Kumar on 26.4.1986 and on inquiry A-3 Vijay Kumar gave Exh.P.111 information leading to recovery of ornaments/articles under Exh. P5 Memo. The Investigation Officer arrested the other three accused and during investigation examined the witnesses and recorded statements. PW 83 Tahsildar Durga Prasad Sharma conducted identification proceedings of the recovered articles and prepared 72 identification reports. After completion of the investigation the charge-sheet came to be filed against the accused persons. During the trial the prosecution examined 86 witnesses and marked the relevant documents in support of its case. A-1 Atma Ram examined himself as a defence witness, besides 4 other witnesses were examined on the side of defence. The trial Court found accused guilty of the charges and sentenced them as narrated above, on appeal the conviction and sentences imposed on A-1 Atma Ram and A-3 Vijay Kumar were confirmed and the other accused were acquitted. A-1 Atma Ram and A-3 Vijay Kumar have challenged the same in these appeals.

5. We heard Mrs. Mridul Aggarwal the learned amicus curie appearing on behalf of the appellant Atma Ram and Mr. Bhagwati Prasad the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant Vijay Kumar and also learned Additional Advocate General appearing for the respondent-State.

6. The prosecution case is that the appellants A-1 Atma Ram and A-3 Vijay Kumar conspired and murdered Keshar Bai and stolen the ornaments/articles possessed by her. Nobody has witnessed the occurrence and the case rests on circumstantial evidence. In a case based on circumstantial evidence the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature. Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence.

7. The prosecution in order to prove its case mainly relied on the following circumstances:

i) Keshar Bai died of homicidal violence.

ii) A-1 Atma Ram, threatened Keshar Bai of possible income-tax raid and seizure of ornaments possessed by her and persuaded her to shift her residence from village to hospital premise with her belongings.

iii) Accused Radha used to demand the ornaments for wearing from Keshar Bai.

iv) On the information furnished by A-1 Atma Ram and A-3 Vijay Kumar, upon their arrest, the ornaments pledged by various persons with Keshar Bai, got recovered from their possession.

8. PW 14 Dr. Dinesh Singh Choudhary conducted post-mortem on the body of Keshar Bai and found the following ante mortem injuries :

i) Incised wound 1”x1” x 1.5” towards right of neck below jaw till trachea
ii) Three Incised wounds on Lt. Side neck till trachea each measuring as 1¼” x ½” x 1”, in the middle 1” x ½” x 1 of below ½” x ¼” x ¼”
iii) Incised wound 2” x ½” x ½” above Rt. Breast
iv) Incised wound 2” x ½” x ½” above Lt. Breast
v) Three incised wounds below Right Breast ½” x ¼” x ¼” IInd 1” x ½” x ¼” IIIrd ½” x ¼” x ¼”
vi) Incised wound Lt. hand from behind 1” x ½” x ½”
vii) Incised wound Rt. hand from behind 1” x ½” x ½” According to him the cause of death was hemorrhage due to cut of neck vessels. Exh. P24 is the post mortem report issued by him.
From the medical evidence it is clear that death of Keshar Bai was homicidal in nature and the first circumstance stood established.

9. Circumstances No.2 and 3 are taken up for discussion together. PW7 Kishore Singh is a resident of village Chhapoli and he has testified that Keshar Bai was a nurse in the hospital and was residing as a tenant in his house on rent of Rs.10 per month for more than a decade and she used to lend loan on interest on mortgage of ornaments and she used to keep the ornaments in a box in the house and a month prior to the occurrence she shifted her residence from his house to the hospital with all her belongings.

10. PW 10 Jaswant Singh is the brother-in-law of Keshar Bai and in his examination-in-chief he has stated that Keshar Bai kept her ornaments in the locker of a bank and A-1 Atma Ram told her that the income-tax people could raid the bank and seize her ornaments and hence Keshar Bai took the ornaments with her. PW 10 has further stated that Keshar Bai used to tell him that accused Radha demanded ornaments from her for wearing and would dance after wearing the same. In the cross examination PW 10 Jaswant Singh has stated that he did not tell in his statement to the police during investigation about the threat made by A1-Atma Ram to Keshar Bai regarding the possibility of an income-tax raid and seizure of ornaments and also the demand of ornaments made by accused Radha to Keshar Bai and her wearing the same. This Court has to form its opinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his deposition inspires confidence. This witness PW 10 Jaswant Singh was admittedly examined by Investigation Officer during investigation and in that statement he has not stated the facts which he now for the first time stated before the Trial Court. This raises a serious doubt as to the veracity of the said facts [See Khalil Khan vs. State of M.P. (2003) 11 SCC 19]. In other words this witness has made material improvement while deposing in the Court and such evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. Thus the evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the circumstances 2 and 3 does not pass the test of credibility and is liable for rejection.

11. The remaining last circumstance pertains to the recoveries made pursuant to the disclosure made by the appellants. The investigation officer PW 85 Shiv Prasad Sharma has claimed that he arrested A-1 Atma Ram on 9.4.1986 and on inquiry he gave Exh. 105 information which led to the recovery of ornaments mentioned in Exh.P8 -list in the presence of witnesses. PW 5 Santbax Singh and PW6 Madanlal Bhavaria are the witnesses to the said recovery. Both of them have testified that accused No.1 Atma Ram took them and the police to his house and entered a room in the court-yard and opened an almirah and took out a plastic bag and handed it over, which contained ornaments of gold and silver and the same was recovered by Memo under Exh. P8 list. The further testimony of the investigation officer is that he arrested A- 3 Vijay Kumar on 26.4.1986 and on inquiry he gave Exh.P 111 information which led to the recovery of ornaments under Exh.P5 Memo in the presence of witnesses. PW4 Tota Ram is the witness for the said recovery and according to him A-3 Vijay Kumar took him and the police to his house and produced silver and gold articles and they were recovered under Exh.P5 Memo, which he attested. The relevant portion of Exh.P5 Memo reads as follows:

“Accused Vijay asked for key of lock of Baithak (room) from father through his brother’s wife of Kailash, and opened lock and then entered towards right side of Baithak. Where in a Almirah a box (old) was found and opened it, and found a cloth bag (Potali) which was tied up. Accused told that the potali contains ornaments. When potali was opened found the following ornaments of gold and silver and a wrist watch….”

12. Both the above said recoveries have been made from the respective houses of the accused/appellants where their families were residing. In fact A-3 Vijay Kumar obtained the key from his father for opening the lock. In such circumstances it cannot be said that the said articles were in the exclusive possession of the accused/appellants and they came to be recovered only on the information furnished by them. The learned senior counsel and the amicus curie appearing for the appellants strenuously contended that there was no fair identification proceedings of property conducted by Tahsildar and firstly it was conducted belatedly and secondly the witnesses were already shown the articles and thirdly there is no proof that those articles were kept with deceased Keshar Bai and the recovery and -identification are unreliable shaky and fake. In this regard reliance was placed on the following decision in State of Vindhya Pradesh vs. Sarua Munni Dhimar and others [AIR 1954 V.P. (Vol.41 CN

15)]. The relevant portion reads thus :

“Further as has been observed in connection with identification of accused persons no presumption attaches to identification proceedings of property. It is for the prosecution to establish affirmatively that every necessary precaution was taken to ensure fair identification. The most essential requirement is that the witnesses should not have had an opportunity of seeing the property after its recovery and before its identification before the Magistrate. For that purpose it is necessary to seal the property as soon as it is recovered and to keep it in a sealed condition till it is produced before the Magistrate. The police officers who take the sealed bundles to the thana after recovery and who take it to the Magistrate for identification proceedings should be examined to prove that the sealed bundles were not tampered with in any way. The sealed bundles should be opened in the presence of the Magistrate conducting the identification proceedings and he should depose about it. The property to be mixed with the property to be identified should also be sealed some days before witnesses are called and the bundle containing it should also be opened in the presence of the Magistrate who should testify about it in court. Further as has been observed in the case of identification proceedings of persons the result of identification as well as the fact whether the property mixed was similar to the property identified should be entered in the memorandum by the Magistrate in his own hand.”
13. In the present case about 131 articles of gold and silver were recovered. About 60 witnesses have testified the pledging of their articles with Keshar Bai. The ornaments like ‘Gorla’, ‘Chain of gold’, ‘madalia” ‘ring’, ‘Bitti’, `Karia’, ‘Pahunchi’, ‘hasli’ etc. are of same kind lookwise having no special marks on them. Learned senior counsel appearing for A-3 Vijay Kumar brought to our notice that one Pahunchi as per Exh.P5 recovery Memo, which contained 59 Mania (Moti) was recovered along with 6 silver ornaments mentioned therein, whereas in Exh.P.68 a copy of Malkhana register the six silver articles alone are found mentioned and there is no mention of the gold ornament ‘pahunchi’ as having kept safely in the Malkhana and it is not known as to where it was kept and produced. On a perusal of the said documents, this contention cannot be easily brushed aside. It is the further submission of the learned senior counsel that as per the prosecution case PW 28 Smt. Raj Kanwar has pledged above said ‘pahunchi’ with Keshar Bai and she has stated in her testimony that her ‘pahunchi’ was of 40 Mania (Moti). If it is so the recovered ‘pahunchi’ is not that of PW 28 Smt. Raj Kanwar. It is doubtful as to whether this recovery claimed by the prosecution is established.

14. It is also the contention of the learned senior counsel that four witnesses examined claimed one ornament as theirs. The identification proceedings of articles was conducted by PW 83 Tahsildar Durga Prasad Sharma in Tehsil and he has claimed to have prepared 72 identification reports. In the cross- examination he has admitted that there were policemen present at the time of identification and he did not know the articles brought to him were in sealed packets or in open condition and he did not remember whether seal used on the packets was official seal since 12 years have already passed. Even he did not know as to who has arranged for articles having similarity to the seized articles for the purpose of identification and identification proceedings were completed in a single day. The Tahsildar even after looking at the Memo was unable to say how many articles of each kind were mixed up with articles to be identified and whether similar articles were new or old, used or unused etc. None of the precaution that ought to have been taken to ensure fair identification was ever taken and no weight can be attached to the evidence of identification of property. Though the trial court has observed in the judgment about the lack of proper identification of the articles, it erroneously proceeded further to accept the same. Recovery of weapons namely knife and screw-driver claimed to have been made on the information given by A-1 Atma Ram is also doubtful. Even assuming to be true that recovery of certain incriminating articles were made at the instance of the accused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, that by itself cannot form the basis of conviction [See Wakkar vs. State of U.P. (2011) 3 SCC 306].

15. In this background we are of the considered opinion that both the Courts below fell in error in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has established its case based on circumstantial evidence beyond all reasonable doubt. Benefit of doubt will have to be given to both the appellants.

16. In the result both the appeals are allowed and the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellants by the courts below are set aside and they are acquitted of the charges. They are directed to be released from the custody forthwith unless required otherwise",1
Gajanan Kamlya Patil,"We are, in these appeals, concerned with the question whether the High Court was justified in relegating the parties to file Civil Suits to recover the lands covered by Survey No.54/4 and Survey No.53/3, both admeasuring 1870 sq. meters, situated at Village Kasarwadavli, Ghodbunder Road, Taluka and Distt. Thane, so as to get the benefit of Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999.

3. We may, for the disposal of these appeals, refer to the facts in Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition No.14690 of 2011, treating the same as the leading case. The Appellant herein was issued a notice dated 17.2.2005 under Section 10(5) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (for short ‘ULC Act’) for taking possession of the Appellant’s land bearing Survey Nos.47/10 and 54/4. It was stated in the notice that in accordance with the notification published in Part-I, Page No. – Konkan Division Supplementary, dated 12.12.2002, in the Gazette of Maharashtra, the land notified had been vested in the Government of Maharashtra and that Additional Collector and Competent Authority, Thane (for short “Competent Authority”), had been authorized by the State Government to take possession of the land in question, details of which had been published in the notification under Section 10(3) and the land be handed over or possession be given within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice. Further, it was also intimated that if the Appellant had failed to give possession of the land, necessary action would be taken for taking possession by application of necessary force.

4. The Appellant, aggrieved by the above-mentioned notice, filed Writ Petition No.1669 of 2010 before the Bombay High Court to quash the notice dated 17.2.2005 and also for a declaration, inter alia, that the land bearing Survey No.54/4 admeasuring 1870 sq. meters is in the physical possession of the Appellant and would continue to vest as such with the Appellant as true and actual owner thereof. The Appellant also sought a declaration that in view of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, the proposed action of the Respondents or State or its authorities for taking possession of the land be declared as null and void and also prayed for other consequential reliefs.

5. The High Court after examining the provisions of the ULC Act as well as the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, and also taking note of the affidavit filed by the State Government and by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) noticed that so far as Survey No.47/10 is concerned, the possession had not been taken over by MMRDA. However, as far as land in Survey No.54/4 was concerned, after noticing that possession had been taken over, the High Court disposed of the Petition granting relief to the Appellant in respect of Survey no.47/10, but so far as Survey No.54/4 is concerned, as already indicated, the Appellant was granted liberty to move the Civil Court for establishing his claim over the property in question.

6. Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant, submitted that the issue raised in this case stands fully covered by the judgment of this Court in State of UP v. Hari Ram (2013) 4 SCC 280 and that the High Court has committed a grave error in holding that the MMRDA is in possession of the land in Survey No.54/4 and hence the question as to whether possession had been legally taken or not has to be decided by the Civil Court. Learned senior counsel also submitted that the State of Maharashtra has adopted the Repeal Act, 1999 on 1.12.2007 and that Respondent No.1 had executed the possession receipt in favour of Respondent No.3 on 2.7.2008 behind the back of the Appellant, without following the due process of law. Learned senior counsel submitted that since possession had not been taken in accordance with law, the Appellant is entitled to the benefit of the Repeal Act, 1999, as was rightly held in respect of Survey No.47/10.

7. Shri A.S. Bhasme, learned counsel appearing for the Respondents, on the other hand contended that the High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that the land in question had been taken over by MMRDA and being a disputed question of fact, the same cannot be decided by the High Court under Section 226 of the Constitution of India and the only remedy available to the Appellant is to file a Civil Suit to establish his right since the dispute is of a civil nature. Learned counsel, therefore, prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

8. We may, at the outset, point out that almost all the legal issues urged before us stand covered by the judgment of the this Court in Hari Ram (supra). However, reference to few facts is necessary for the disposal of these appeals. The Competent Authority published a notification dated 17.1.2000 under Section 10(1) of the ULC Act in the Gazette of Government of Maharashtra on 15.6.2000, wherein the land held by the Appellant was shown as the land to be acquired by the Government of Maharashtra. Following that, a notification dated 14.3.2000 under Sub-Section (3) of Section 10 of the ULC Act was published notifying the public that the land shown in the schedule therein is covered and the land in Survey No.54/4 as well would be considered to be acquired by the Government of Maharashtra w.e.f. 15.6.2000 and the said land would be vested with the Government of Maharashtra from the said date.

9. The Competent Authority then issued yet another notification dated 2.8.2002 for information of the public that the land described in the schedule therein which included the land in Survey No.54/4 as well, have been considered to be acquired by the Government of Maharashtra w.e.f. 15.9.2002 and the said land would be vested for all purposes free from all charges to the Government of Maharashtra from the said date. The Competent Authority, as already indicated, issued a show cause notice dated 17.2.2005 under Sub-Section (5) of Section 10 of the ULC Act to the Appellant to hand over possession of the land in question within 30 days from the date of receipt of that notice. It was also indicated therein that if the Appellant failed to give possession of the land, necessary action would be taken for taking possession by the application of necessary force.

10. We may indicate that all the above-mentioned proceedings were initiated under the ULC Act, 1976, but the said Act was repealed by the Parliament by the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 on 22.3.1999 which came into force w.e.f. 11.1.1999. The State of Maharashtra vide its notification dated 1.12.2007 adopted the Repeal Act, 1999 w.e.f. 1.12.2007. After adoption of the Repeal Act, 1999, on 1.12.2007, the Circle Office Balkum, Taluka & District Thane, executed “possession receipt” on 2.7.2008 of the land bearing Survey No.54/4 belonging to the Appellant in favour of the Chief Surveyor of MMRDA, pursuant to the orders of the Collector, Thane dated 1.7.2008. No notice, admittedly, was given to the Appellants before executing the possession receipt. In this case, an additional affidavit dated 29.4.2010 was filed by the Competent Authority stating that he could not find any document like Panchanama or possession receipt in respect of the land covered by Survey No.54/4 and few other Survey numbers. The operative portion of the affidavit reads as follows :-

“I have stated in my affidavit in reply dated 20.3.2010 that on 2.7.2008 the Circle Officer has delivered the possession of the land bearing Survey No.103/3 area 3890 sq. mtrs., 3/10 area 3600 sq. mtrs., 98/6 area 1708 sq. mtrs., 53/3 area 2450 sq. mtrs., 54/4 area 1870 sq. mtrs to the MMRDA. I state that I have inspected my record, however, I could not find any document like panchanama or possession receipt in respect of aforesaid lands by which its possession was obtained from the land holder under Urban Land Ceiling Act.”
11. We have another affidavit dated 2.7.2010 by the Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra, wherein he has categorically stated that the possession had not been handed over by the landowner to the Competent Authority. The operative portion of the same reads as under :-

“The records of right of the said land have been mutated in favour of the Government on the basis of the notification issued under Section 10(3) of the ULC Act. I say and submit that on enquiry, it is revealed that, though the notice under Section 10(5) was issued on 17.02.2005 for handing over possession of the surplus vacant land, the possession of land has not been handed over by concerned landowner to the Competent Authority or to his representative.” The Affidavit also further reads as under :-
“Therefore, Government was under impression that since the land has been vested into the Government as per the notification under Section 10(3) dated 02.08.2002, the Government has every right to use the said land for public purpose. I say that, in the aforesaid background, the decision was taken to allot the land to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, and therefore, as per the directions of the Government and subsequent directions of Collector, Thane, the Circle Officer, Balukm, Distt. Thane handed over the possession of the surplus land to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority on 02.07.2008.” The affidavit also says that actual possession was not taken over as per the provisions of the ULC Act, 1976 before 29.11.2007. The operative portion of the same reads as under:-
“I say and submit that, even though the possession of the land has been handed over to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority by Circle Officer, Balkum on 02.07.2008, the actual possession of said surplus land was not taken over as per the provisions of the ULC Act, 1976 before 29.11.2007.”
12. We may indicate, apart from the affidavits filed by the officials in this case, no other document has been made available either before the High Court or before this Court, either showing that the Appellant had voluntarily surrendered or the Respondents had taken peaceful or forcible possession of the lands. In Hari Ram (supra) this Court examined the meaning and context of Sub-sections (3) to (6) of Section 10 of the ULC Act and held as follows :
“30. Vacant land, it may be noted, is not actually acquired but deemed to have been acquired, in that deeming things to be what they are not. Acquisition, therefore, does not take possession unless there is an indication to the contrary. It is trite law that in construing a deeming provision, it is necessary to bear in mind the legislative purpose. The purpose of the Act is to impose ceiling on vacant land, for the acquisition of land in excess of the ceiling limit thereby to regulate construction on such lands, to prevent concentration of urban lands in the hands of a few persons, so as to bring about equitable distribution. For achieving that object, various procedures have to be followed for acquisition and vesting. When we look at those words in the above setting and the provisions to follow such as sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 10, the words “acquired” and “vested” have different meaning and content. Under Section 10(3), what is vested is de jure possession not de facto, for more reasons than one because we are testing the expression on a statutory hypothesis and such an hypothesis can be carried only to the extent necessary to achieve the legislative intent.
Voluntary surrender
31. The “vesting” in sub-section (3) of Section 10, in our view, means vesting of title absolutely and not possession though nothing stands in the way of a person voluntarily surrendering or delivering possession. The Court in Maharaj Singh v. State of U.P. (1977 (1) SCC 155), while interpreting Section 117(1) of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 held that “vesting” is a word of slippery import and has many meanings and the context controls the text and the purpose and scheme project the particular semantic shade or nuance of meaning. The Court in Rajendra Kumar v. Kalyan (2000 (8) SCC 99) held as follows: (SCC p. 114, para 28) “28. … We do find some contentious substance in the contextual facts, since vesting shall have to be a ‘vesting’ certain. ‘To “vest”, generally means to give a property in.’ (Per Brett, L.J. Coverdale v. Charlton (1878) 4 QBD 104 (CA): Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary, 5th Edn., Vol. VI.) Vesting in favour of the unborn person and in the contextual facts on the basis of a subsequent adoption after about 50 years without any authorisation cannot however but be termed to be a contingent event. To ‘vest’, cannot be termed to be an executory devise. Be it noted however, that ‘vested’ does not necessarily and always mean ‘vest in possession’ but includes ‘vest in interest’ as well.”
32. We are of the view that so far as the present case is concerned, the word “vesting” takes in every interest in the property including de jure possession and, not de facto but it is always open to a person to voluntarily surrender and deliver possession, under Section 10(3) of the Act.
33. Before we examine sub-section (5) and sub-section (6) of Section 10, let us examine the meaning of sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Act, which says that during the period commencing on the date of publication under sub-section (1), ending with the day specified in the declaration made under sub- section (3), no person shall transfer by way of sale, mortgage, gift or otherwise, any excess vacant land, specified in the notification and any such transfer made in contravention of the Act shall be deemed to be null and void. Further, it also says that no person shall alter or cause to be altered the use of such excess vacant land. Therefore, from the date of publication of the notification under sub-section (1) and ending with the date specified in the declaration made in sub-section (3), there is no question of disturbing the possession of a person, the possession, therefore, continues to be with the holder of the land.
Peaceful dispossession
34. Sub-section (5) of Section 10, for the first time, speaks of “possession” which says that where any land is vested in the State Government under sub-section (3) of Section 10, the competent authority may, by notice in writing, order any person, who may be in possession of it to surrender or transfer possession to the State Government or to any other person, duly authorised by the State Government.
35. If de facto possession has already passed on to the State Government by the two deeming provisions under sub-section (3) of Section 10, there is no necessity of using the expression “where any land is vested” under sub-section (5) of Section 10. Surrendering or transfer of possession under sub-section (3) of Section 10 can be voluntary so that the person may get the compensation as provided under Section 11 of the Act early. Once there is no voluntary surrender or delivery of possession, necessarily the State Government has to issue notice in writing under sub-section (5) of Section 10 to surrender or deliver possession. Sub-section (5) of Section 10 visualises a situation of surrendering and delivering possession, peacefully while sub- section (6) of Section 10 contemplates a situation of forceful dispossession.
Forceful dispossession
36. The Act provides for forceful dispossession but only when a person refuses or fails to comply with an order under sub- section (5) of Section 10. Sub-section (6) of Section 10 again speaks of “possession” which says, if any person refuses or fails to comply with the order made under sub-section (5), the competent authority may take possession of the vacant land to be given to the State Government and for that purpose, force—as may be necessary—can be used. Sub-section (6), therefore, contemplates a situation of a person refusing or fails to comply with the order under sub-section (5), in the event of which the competent authority may take possession by use of force. Forcible dispossession of the land, therefore, is being resorted to only in a situation which falls under sub-section (6) and not under sub-section (5) of Section 10. Sub-sections (5) and (6), therefore, take care of both the situations i.e. taking possession by giving notice, that is, “peaceful dispossession” and on failure to surrender or give delivery of possession under Section 10(5), then “forceful dispossession” under sub-section (6) of Section 10.
37. The requirement of giving notice under sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 10 is mandatory. Though the word “may” has been used therein, the word “may” in both the sub-sections has to be understood as “shall” because a court charged with the task of enforcing the statute needs to decide the consequences that the legislature intended to follow from failure to implement the requirement. Effect of non-issue of notice under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of Section 11 is that it might result in the landholder being dispossessed without notice, therefore, the word “may” has to be read as “shall”.”
13. We have, therefore, clearly indicated that it was always open to the authorities to take forcible possession and, in fact, in the notice issued under Section 10(5) of the ULC Act, it was stated that if the possession had not been surrendered, possession would be taken by application of necessary force. For taking forcible possession, certain procedures had to be followed. Respondents have no case that such procedures were followed and forcible possession was taken.
Further, there is nothing to show that the Respondents had taken peaceful possession, nor there is anything to show that the Appellants had given voluntary possession. Facts would clearly indicate that only de jure possession had been taken by the Respondents and not de facto possession before coming into force of the repeal of the Act. Since there is nothing to show that de facto possession had been taken from the Appellants prior to the execution of the possession receipt in favour of MRDA, it cannot hold on to the lands in question, which are legally owned and possessed by the Appellants. Consequently, we are inclined to allow this appeal and quash the notice dated 17.2.2005 and subsequent action taken therein in view of the repeal of the ULC Act. The above reasoning would apply in respect of other appeals as well and all proceedings initiated against the Appellants, therefore, would stand quashed.

14. The Appeals are, accordingly, allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.",1
VIJAYANDER KUMAR & ORS,"The appellants have preferred this appeal against the dismissal of their petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for brevity `Cr.P.C.’) by the High Court of judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur. The High Court declined to interfere with the order of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sriganganagar, dated 22.05.2000 in Case No. 63/2000, taking cognizance of offence under Section 420 read with Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code.

2. Respondent No.2, Surendra Singhla, lodged a police case against the appellants as well as one Satish Singhla on 28.04.1998. According to the averments and allegations in the written report, the informant is a partner of the Firm M/s. Rajshree Cotton Corporation, Sriganganagar, working as broker as well as dealer in the sale and purchase of cotton. The appellants are Directors of M/s. R.P. Taxfab Limited, Modi Nagar, who purchased cotton through informant firm from time to time. As per the accounts, the informant firm was to receive a sum of Rs.47,28,115.80/-. The accused persons without taking the informant into confidence, entered into an agreement for transfer of management, assets and liabilities of M/s. R.P. Taxfab Limited in favour of accused Satish Singhla and two others who became the new Directors. The management of the Company was transferred on 24.02.1998 and on 27.02.1998 the informant was called by the appellants and told that the outstanding amount payable by the appellants shall be paid by the new Directors. The informant did not agree to this. On next date, the appellants through a demand draft for Rs.10,00,000/- (rupees ten lacs) and returned cotton yarn worth Rs.13,26,560/- settled the dues in part and for the remaining dues they persuaded the informant to accept four post-dated cheques issued by the new Director Satish Singhla. The informant accepted the cheques on being assured by the accused persons that when presented on due dates the cheques shall be honoured. On such persuasion and trust, the informant signed some typed papers showing that he had agreed to receive the balance amount from the new Directors of the Company and had received draft and goods from the appellants.

3. Besides the aforesaid allegations and averments in the written information, the informant has also alleged that he would not have signed the said papers nor received the post-dated cheques but for the assurances given by the accused persons in presence of two witnesses. It is further alleged that when the informant presented cheque dated 25.03.1998 for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (rupees five lacs) through his bank, the said cheque was dishonoured because accused Satish Singhla had got the payment of the cheque stopped and that all the accused by mutual consent (conspiracy) have played a fraud and cheated him by making false statement and holding false assurances whereby they induced him to sign some papers. Allegedly, the accused had full knowledge even before issuing the cheques that these shall not be honoured and they had such dishonest intention from the beginning.

4. It is not in dispute that when the cheque bounced, the respondent no.2 gave a legal notice and initiated a separate complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, besides lodging of the present FIR on 28.4.1998. The complaint filed against the appellants under the Negotiable Instruments Act stands quashed by the High Court on the basis that they had not issued the cheques in question. The appellants’ earlier petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing of FIR vide Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 466 of 1998 was dismissed by the High Court by order dated 12.02.1999 which is reported in 1999 Criminal law Journal 1849 (Vijayander Kumar and Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another). A perusal of that judgment discloses that the High Court considered in detail the averments and allegations in the FIR and came to the conclusion that in view of allegations and attending circumstances, at that stage it was not possible to hold that the appellants cannot be liable for commission of any offence. The High Court held that there was a case worth investigation.

5. Subsequently, the police concluded investigation and submitted final report to the effect that the case is of civil nature. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sriganganagar, rejected the final report and after hearing the parties took cognizance of the offence under Section 420 read with Section 120-B of the IPC against all the five accused vide his order dated 22.05.2000.

6. The challenge to that order through a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. has been rejected by the High Court by the order under Appeal.

7. Learned senior counsel for the appellants drew our attention to some letters and communications such as annexure P.1 and P.2 both dated 27.02.1998 and annexure P.10 dated 24.02.1998 to support his contention that on 24.02.1998 itself the change in the management was brought to the notice of the informant with an intimation that a liability of Rs.23,00,000/- (rupees twenty three lacs) has been transferred to the new management which they shall pay and thereafter, on 27.02.1998 the informant received payment from the appellants as well as accepted the post-dated cheques on 27.02.1998 itself. On that basis it has been contended that wrong averments and allegations have been made in the FIR. It is further case of the appellants that the allegations and averments do not make out any criminal offence.

8. On behalf of the appellants reliance has been placed upon judgments of this Court in the case of Thermax Limited and Others Vs. K.M.Johny and Others[1] and in case of Dalip Kaur and Others vs. Jagnar Singh and another[2]. There can be no dispute with the legal proposition laid down in the case of Anil Mahajan vs. Bhor Industries Limited[3] which has been discussed in paragraph 31 in the case of Thermox Limited (supra) that if the complaint discloses only a simple case of civil dispute between the parties and there is an absolute absence of requisite averment to make out a case of cheating, the criminal proceeding can be quashed. Similar is the law noticed in the case of Dalip Kaur (supra). In this case the matter was remanded back to the High Court because of non-consideration of relevant issues as noticed in paragraph 10, but the law was further clarified in paragraph 11 by placing reliance upon judgment of this Court in R.Kalyani vs. Janak C.Mehta[4]. It is relevant to extract paragraph 11 of the judgment which runs as follows:

“11.There cannot furthermore be any doubt that the High Court would exercise its inherent jurisdiction only when one or the other propositions of law, as laid down in R. Kalyani v. Janak C. Mehta is attracted, which are as under:
“(1) The High Court ordinarily would not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to quash a criminal proceeding and, in particular, a first information report unless the allegations contained therein, even if given face value and taken to be correct in their entirety, disclosed no cognizable offence.
(2) For the said purpose the Court, save and except in very exceptional circumstances, would not look to any document relied upon by the defence.
(3) Such a power should be exercised very sparingly. If the allegations made in the FIR disclose commission of an offence, the court shall not go beyond the same and pass an order in favour of the accused to hold absence of any mens rea or actus reus.
(4) If the allegation discloses a civil dispute, the same by itself may not be ground to hold that the criminal proceedings should not be allowed to continue.”
9. Learned senior counsel for the appellants also placed reliance upon judgment of this Court in the case of Devendra and Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another[5], only to highlight that a second petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. can be entertained because order of Magistrate taking cognizance gives rise to a new cause of action. This issue does not require any deliberation because learned senior counsel for the respondent no.2, the informant, has not raised any objection to the maintainability of petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.
10. Contra the submission advanced on behalf of the appellants, learned counsel for the respondent no.2 has submitted that there is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the appellants that the FIR discloses only a civil case or that there is no allegation or averment making out a criminal offence. For that purpose he relied upon judgment of the High Court rendered in the facts of this very case reported in 1999 Criminal Law Journal, 1849, already noted earlier.

11. No doubt, the views of the High Court in respect of averments and allegations in the FIR were in the context of a prayer to quash the FIR itself but in the facts of this case those findings and observations are still relevant and they do not support the contentions on behalf of the appellants. At the present stage when the informant and witnesses have supported the allegations made in the FIR, it would not be proper for this Court to evaluate the merit of the allegations on the basis of documents annexed with the memo of appeal. Such materials can be produced by the appellants in their defence in accordance with law for due consideration at appropriate stage.

12. Learned counsel for the respondents is correct in contending that a given set of facts may make out a civil wrong as also a criminal offence and only because a civil remedy may also be available to the informant/complainant that itself cannot be a ground to quash a criminal proceeding. The real test is whether the allegations in the complaint discloses a criminal offence or not. This proposition is supported by several judgments of this Court as noted in paragraph 16 of judgment in the case of Ravindra Kumar Madhanlal Goenka and Another vs. Rugmini Ram Raghav Spinners Private Limited[6]

13. On considering the facts of the present case it is found that the facts were properly noticed by the High Court on earlier occasion while examining the petition preferred by the appellants for quashing of FIR of this case. The same view has been reiterated by the High Court in the order under appeal for not interfering with the order of cognizance by the learned Magistrate. Hence, we do not find any good ground to interfere with the criminal proceedings against the appellants at this stage. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.

14. It is, however, made clear that observations in this order or in the order under appeal are only for deciding the issues raised at the present stage and shall not affect the defence of the appellants at a subsequent stage of the proceeding.",0
RADHEY SHYAM,"The appellant was convicted by Additional Sessions Judge Kota, Rajasthan for offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

2. In short, the case of the prosecution is that on 24/2/1997, the appellant cut the throats of his children Rakesh and Rajkanta with a blade in the house of his in-laws where he was staying for his treatment. He was suffering from tuberculosis. According to the prosecution, this incident was witnessed by Banwari, the brother-in-law of the appellant. Banwari informed about it to his brother Kajod, who had come from the market. Kajod found Rakesh dead. Rajkanta was alive and was in pain. Kajod took her to the doctor and the doctor declared her dead. Kajod lodged FIR. Investigation was started. The appellant was arrested. After completion of the investigation, the appellant came to be charged under Section 302 of the IPC. In support of its case, prosecution examined 14 witnesses. PW-2 Banwari is the eye-witness. He is a child witness. His evidence is material to the prosecution. The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge. He stated that he was falsely implicated in the case, because his relations with his wife’s family were strained.

3. Shri Santosh Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the entire case rests on the testimony of a child witness. The child witness’s evidence has to be carefully scrutinized and, only if it is found reliable, it can be accepted. He submitted that PW-2 Banwari’s evidence does not answer the test laid down by this Court in numerous judgments and, hence, no reliance can be placed on him. In support of this submission, counsel relied on Rameshwar s/o. Kalyan Singh v. The State of Rajasthan[1], Panchhi & Ors. v. State of U.P.[2], Ratansinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak v. State of Gujarat[3] and Raj Kumar v. State of Maharashtra[4]. He submitted that the entire incident appears to be inherently improbable. If throats of two children were cut with a blade, they would have raised loud cries and that would have brought the neighbours to the room. Counsel submitted that there are inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses. The story that PW-2 Banwari saw the incident through the hole of the door is difficult to digest. Counsel submitted that recovery of blade from the possession of the appellant is also not proved. Motive is also not established. In the circumstances benefit of doubt must be given to the appellant, who is in jail for about 19 years.

4. Shri Milind Kumar, learned counsel for the State, on the other hand, submitted that child witness PW-2 Banwari inspires confidence. It is established that the appellant was alone in the room with his children and, hence, none else but he can be held responsible for their murder. Counsel pointed out that pertinently on the clothes of the appellant, blood was found. The blood group of those stains matched with that of the blood found on the clothes of deceased Rajkanta. This indicates that the appellant killed his children. Counsel submitted that, therefore, the conviction and sentence of the appellant be confirmed.

5. The post-mortem notes make it clear that the throats of the children were cut. We have gone through the evidence rather minutely because we felt that the approach of the trial court and the High Court was not right. We shall therefore briefly refer to the evidence.

6. There is no challenge to the prosecution case that at the material time, the appellant was staying in his in-law’s house with his children. PW-1 Kajod stated that on the date of incident at about 2.00 p.m., the appellant sent him to bring Kachodi and Jalebi. Within half an hour, he came back. Since deceased Rakesh had high fever, the appellant told him to bring a tablet from the shop. When he came back with a tablet, he saw a crowd gathered in front of his house. The appellant was holding a blade in his hand and throats of Rakesh and Rajkanta had been cut. Rajkanta was in pain. He lifted her and took her to Dr. R.N. Khan, where she was declared dead. He brought her home. He then gave his statement to the police. In his cross-examination he stated that his sister and mother had gone to the market. He added that his sisters PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati had gone to the market and when he went to purchase the tablet there was no one present at home except the appellant and his children Rakesh and Rajkanta. When his police statement was shown to him, he stated that he could not say why the fact that he had seen a blade in the appellant’s hand was not recorded by the police. He then stated that he did not see the blade in the appellant’s hand. He denied that the police recovered the blade from the almirah. He added that the blade was in possession of the police. He stated that when he came back, the appellant was sleeping and there was blood on his clothes. He stated that blood stained clothes of the appellant were seized and he signed on the panchnama. He changed his version and stated that the police did not seize and seal the blood stained clothes of the appellant before him. He clearly admitted that he had not actually seen the appellant cutting the throats of the deceased but he got to know about it from the people. Therefore, this witness is not an eye witness. While in examination-in-chief, he states that he had seen the appellant holding a blade in his hand, in the cross-examination, he denies having seen a blade in the appellant’s hand. His case that his sisters had gone to the market is not consistent with the evidence of PW-2 Banwari, the eye-witness as we shall soon see. He stated that he had conversation with deceased Rajkanta when he was carrying her to the doctor and she named the appellant as her assailant, but this fact is not noted in his police statement. He has denied that blood stained clothes of the appellant were seized in his presence, thus making the panchnama on which he is stated to have signed a fabricated document.

7. PW-2 Banwari is a child witness. He was ten years old when he gave evidence. Before we proceed to his evidence, we must refer to the judgments of this Court on which reliance is placed by the counsel to show how child witness’s evidence is to be appreciated.

8. In Ratansinh Dalsukhbhai Nayak, this Court considered the evidentiary value of the testimony of a child witness and observed as under:

“The decision on the question whether the child witness has sufficient intelligence primarily rests with the trial Judge who notices his manners, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, and the said Judge may resort to any examination which will tend to disclose his capacity and intelligence as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath. The decision of the trial court may, however, be disturbed by the higher court if from what is preserved in the records, it is clear that his conclusion was erroneous. This precaution is necessary because child witnesses are amenable to tutoring and often live in a world of make-believe. Though it is an established principle that child witnesses are dangerous witnesses as they are pliable and liable to be influenced easily, shaken and moulded, but it is also an accepted norm that if after careful scrutiny of their evidence the court comes to the conclusion that there is an impress of truth in it, there is no obstacle in the way of accepting the evidence of a child witness.”
9. In Panchhi, after reiterating the same principles, this Court observed that the evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by what others tell him and, thus, a child witness is an easy pray to tutoring. This Court further observed that the courts have held that the evidence of a child witness must find adequate corroboration before it is relied upon. But, it is more a rule of practical wisdom than of law. It is not necessary to refer to other judgments cited by learned counsel because they reiterate the same principles. The conclusion which can be deduced from the relevant pronouncements of this Court is that the evidence of a child witness must be subjected to close scrutiny to rule out the possibility of tutoring. It can be relied upon if the court finds that the child witness has sufficient intelligence and understanding of the obligation of an oath. As a matter of caution, the court must find adequate corroboration to the child witness’s evidence. If found, reliable and truthful and corroborated by other evidence on record, it can be accepted without hesitation. We will scrutinize PW-2 Banwari’s evidence in light of the above principles.

10. PW-2 Banwari stated that on the date of incident his sisters PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati were at home. PW-1 Kajod was also there. The appellant and his children were in the house. At about 1.00 p.m., Kajod was sent to bring Jalebi. He was sitting outside the house. According to him PW-3 Suganya was also sitting outside the house. At that time, his cousin came there and asked for a matchbox. He went to the house to bring the matchbox. From the hole of the door he saw the appellant cutting the necks of Rakesh and Rajkanta with a blade. He then opened the door by inserting his fingers through the hole. He saw the appellant cutting the neck of deceased Rakesh. He went to call his sister PW-3 Suganya. According to him, the appellant cut the neck of Rajkanta while he had gone to call his sister PW-3 Suganya. Both his sisters rushed to the room. PW-1 Kajod also came there. Upon arrival of PW-1 Kajod, he told him the entire story. In the cross-examination, he again reiterated that PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati were present near the scene of offence. They were sitting with him outside the house. Thus, there is a glaring discrepancy in the evidence of PW-1 Kajod and this witness as regards presence of PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati near the scene of offence at the time of incident. His version that he saw the incident through the hole of the door does not inspire confidence. He has changed his version frequently. At one stage, he says that when he went to bring the matchbox, he peeped through the hole of the door and saw necks of Rakesh and Rajkanta being cut. Then he says that he opened the door by inserting his fingers through the hole and saw the appellant cutting the throat of Rakesh and when he went to call his sister, the appellant cut the throat of Rajkanta. A doubt is, therefore, created as to whether he really saw the incident. Moreover, if the throats of two children were cut, it is inconceivable that he would not have heard cries of the children. It is also difficult to accept that at that time, his cousin came there to ask for a matchbox and he went to the house to bring the matchbox. This story appears to have been created to establish that PW-2 Banwari went to the house and saw the incident through the hole of the door. In such a situation, when it is difficult to place reliance on the testimony of a child witness, it is necessary to look for corroboration to his evidence from other witnesses. We find that the other prosecution witnesses do not corroborate the evidence of PW-2 Banwari, at all, as we shall soon see. It is, therefore, very difficult to rely on PW- 2 Banwari’s evidence.

11. PW-3 Suganya stated that at about 2.30 p.m. the appellant was sleeping in her maternal house at Kotdi. Deceased Rakesh and Rajkanta were playing near him. At that time she, her sister PW-10 Nati and children were present there. The appellant asked for Jalebi and Kachodi. PW-1 Kajod went and brought Jalebi and Kachodi. The appellant ate them and gave some to his children Rakesh and Rajkanta. According to her, Rajkanta had fever and, therefore, the appellant had sent PW-1 Kajod to bring tablets. When she went inside the room, the appellant sent her away. He told her younger sister PW-10 Nati that he wanted to ease himself and, therefore, PW- 10 Nati should stay outside. PW-10 Nati then sat in the courtyard along with the children. After that, the appellant shut the door. Thereafter, when she went with a tablet to the house, PW-10 Nati told her that as the appellant wanted to ease himself she should not go inside. She, therefore, sat outside the house. Thereafter, her cousin Man Singh came there. He wanted a matchbox. PW-2 Banwari went to the house to bring the matchbox. PW-2 Banwari saw through the hole of the closed door the appellant cutting the throat of his daughter with a blade. Thereafter, he unbolted the door by putting his fingers inside. He then screamed that the appellant had cut the throats of the children and called her. She rushed to the room. She saw the appellant sitting inside the room after cutting the throats of his children. There was blood in the room. Clothes of the appellant were also blood stained. When she entered the room, she did not see anything in the hands of the appellant. She saw a blade lying there. According to her, PW- 1 Kajod took the children to the hospital but the children were dead. She admitted that she went to the room after PW-2 Banwari called her and she had not seen anything before that. It is clear from PW-3 Suganya’s evidence that she is not an eye-witness. Her version differs from that of PW-2 Banwari. PW-2 Banwari stated that he saw Rakesh’s throat being cut. He went to call PW-3 Suganya. By that time, the appellant had cut the throat of Rajkanta. PW-3 Suganya stated that PW-2 Banwari saw that the appellant had cut the throats of the children. He screamed and, thereafter, she rushed to the house.

12. PW-7 Prithviraj turned hostile. He did not support PW-1 Kajod’s version that he accompanied PW-1 Kajod to the doctor when PW-1 Kajod carried Rajkanta to the doctor; that he was present when the incident took place and that he saw the chopped throats of the deceased children. PW-10 Nati, the sister of PW-1 Kajod also turned hostile. She went to the extent of saying that she did not know who killed Rakesh and Rajkanta.

13. PW-12 Tej Singh, the Investigating Officer gave a new twist to the prosecution story. He stated that while in custody, the appellant gave information that he had hidden a blade in the upper section of an almirah situated in the room. He recorded the said statement and, pursuant to the said statement, he seized the blade, which was kept in the almirah and sealed it. This is contrary to the evidence of PW-1 Kajod that the blade was in the hand of the appellant and the evidence of PW-3 Suganya that the blade was lying in the room. He also stated that the appellant was admitted in the hospital because he was unwell. However, he admitted that no hospital record was produced by him about the admission of the appellant in the hospital. He stated that he did not know whether there were any cut marks or abrasions on the fingers of the appellant. PW-13 Vimala is the wife of the appellant. Her evidence gives a set back to the prosecution case. She stated that she went to the market leaving her deceased children with the appellant. According to her, she rushed to the house when the police told her that the appellant had cut the throats of her children. Surprisingly, in the cross-examination, she stated that the appellant used to love her children very much and that he was also not angry with her. She further stated that the appellant was a normal person and was not suffering from insanity.

14. Upon a careful perusal of the evidence on record, we feel that there are too many drawbacks in the prosecution case. Firstly, we find the prosecution story to be inherently improbable. The post-mortem notes of the deceased children show that their throats were badly cut. The injury of Rajkanta is described as under:

“Incised wound 13”x1”xTr.cut Tr.upto cervical vertebral column in front of neck middle region cutting all structures including muscles, vessels, nerves, trachea & Oesophagues etc. Bleeding profusely & soft red clots present.
The cause of death was shock as a result of ante mortem injury to neck leading to haemorrhage.” The injury of Rakesh is described as under:
“Incised wound 8”x1”xTr.cut Tr.upto vertebral column (Cervical) x 1.1/2” cutting all structures including muscles, vessels, trachea, Oesophagues & nerves etc. Bleeding profusely & soft red blood clots.
The cause of death was shock as a result of ante mortem injury to neck leading to haemorrhage.” There is nothing to suggest that the children were drugged. If the appellant had cut the throats of the children in such a brutal manner leading to above-mentioned serious injuries, the children would have raised loud cries drawing attention of PW-2 Banwari and his sisters PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati to the house. Neighbours would have also rushed there. It is inconceivable that the appellant would carry out such a sinister operation within a short span, quietly without drawing attention of people sitting outside. Moreover, while the appellant was cutting the throat of one child, the other child would have reacted and tried to stop him. The children would certainly have resisted the attempt in their own way. The appellant is stated to have used a shaving blade which had sharp edges on both sides. In the scuffle which must have ensued, the appellant must have received injuries on his fingers. As already noted, the appellant was admitted in a hospital but the Investigating Officer has not produced his hospital record which could have shown injuries sustained by him on his fingers. The prosecution story that blade was used by the appellant is also not established. PW-1 Kajod stated that he saw the appellant holding a blade in his hand. In the cross-examination, he stated that he did not see a blade in the appellant’s hand, but it was in possession of the police. PW-3 Suganya stated that she saw the blade lying in the room. PW- 12 Tej Singh, the Investigating Officer introduced an entirely new story. He stated that the blade was discovered at the instance of the appellant from the upper section of an almirah where the appellant had hidden it. Thus, the prosecution case that the appellant used a blade is shrouded in suspicion.

15. Another significant lacuna in the prosecution case is the contradictory statements of PW-1 Kajod and PW-2 Banwari as regards presence of PW-3 Suganya and PW-10 Nati in the house. While PW-1 Kajod stated that they were not present, PW-2 Banwari stated that they were present and, in fact, on seeing the incident, he called PW-3 Suganya to the house. If the two sisters were present, there was no need for them to wait for a call from PW-2 Banwari. The children’s cries would have made them run to the house. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the deaths of Rakesh and Rajkanta occurred in a manner in which the prosecution wants to project they had occurred.

16. The appellant’s wife has gone on record to say that the appellant was a normal person; that he was not suffering from insanity; that he loved her children very much and that he was not angry with her. If the appellant had killed her two children, she would never have given such a certificate to him. PW-3 Suganya stated that the appellant sent for Kachodi and Jalebi and when PW-1 Kajod brought them, he gave them to his children Rakesh and Rajkanta. This happened just before the incident. PW-1 Kajod stated that because Rakesh was having fever, the appellant sent him to buy tablets. These are not signs of a person who would want to kill his children. Nothing has been brought on record to suggest why the appellant killed his children. The prosecution has failed to prove motive. It is true that if there is eye-witness account, absence of motive is immaterial. But as we have already noted the evidence of lone eye-witness i.e. child witness PW-2 Banwari does not inspire confidence. The other evidence on record is so infirm that it cannot supply the required corroboration to his evidence.

17 It is the prosecution case that the clothes of the appellant were blood stained and that blood group of the blood found on the clothes of deceased Rajkanta was the same as the blood group of the blood found on the clothes of the appellant. Blood found on the clothes of Rakesh is stated to be of ‘O’ group. Pertinently, the pancha to the seizure panchnama under which the clothes of the appellant and deceased children were seized, has turned hostile. PW-1 Kajod who is signatory to the panchnama of seizure of clothes denied that the clothes of the appellant were seized before him. The blood groups of the appellant, deceased Rajkanta and deceased Rakesh were not ascertained. To establish its case, the prosecution should have brought on record blood group of the appellant, blood groups of the deceased children and the medical record of the appellant from the hospital in which he was admitted. Moreover, the prosecution case that the blood found on the clothes of the appellant was of the same group as that of the blood found on the clothes of Rajkanta, was not put to the appellant in his statement recorded under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This is a most vital circumstance which, if established, would have linked the appellant to the crime in question. It was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to put it to the appellant so that he could have offered explanation for the same. The prosecution failed to do so. This is a serious lacuna which cannot be condoned.

18. It is also surprising that if the appellant had committed such a heinous crime he would continue to sit in the room. His first reaction would have been to run away. It is also difficult to appreciate as to how those who had gathered at the scene of offence kept quiet after seeing such a gruesome crime. The reaction of the people would have been to take him to the police station. The prosecution is heavily relying on the fact that the appellant was alone in the room along with the children and no one else could have gone inside the room to kill the children. Normally, this argument would have impressed us if the prosecution had established the other circumstances to the hilt. But in this case the prosecution has not established even a single circumstance beyond doubt. We are of the opinion that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis of the case. The incident does not appear to have happened in the manner in which the prosecution wants the court to believe it had happened. The police came to the scene after about one hour. As to what happened in between is anybody’s guess. The story of alleged dying declaration of Rajkanta is not established. The discovery of blade from the almirah is not established and has rightly been rejected by the trial court. The panch witness turned hostile. Resultantly, the recoveries are not established. PW-13 Vimala, the wife of the appellant, categorically stated that the appellant loved his children and he was a normal person. His conduct prior to the incident does not suggest guilty mind. He fed his children Jalebi and Kachodi. He ordered tablets for Rakesh because he had high fever. The injuries suffered by the children are so grave that the children would have raised cries. Nobody has stated that they heard any cries. The story that the child witness saw the incident through the hole is difficult to digest. No independent witness has been examined and the evidence of all the witnesses is replete with inconsistencies. All these circumstances make the prosecution story doubtful. The appellant, therefore, must be given benefit of doubt. In the circumstances we set aside the impugned order. The appellant is directed to be released forthwith unless required in any other case.

19. The criminal appeal is disposed of in the afore-stated terms.",0
INTERNATIONAL CONVEYORS LTD.,"Being aggrieved by the Order No. A/1426/WZB/2004/CI dated 6th September, 2004 of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, West Zone Bench at Bombay in Appeal No.C/560/04, the appellant has approached this Court by way of this appeal.

2. In our opinion, this case hardly involves any legal issue but we feel more concerned about the hard luck of the appellant, a manufacturer of PVC Coal Conveyor Belting made from imported Nylon Yarn. We do not propose to go into the circumstances in which the litigation had started but we start from the point which gave rise to some confusion and as a result thereof the appellant was dragged to the present litigation.

3. Upon hearing the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of the impugned order and other relevant orders, we find that there was some issue with regard to imposition of duty on import of Nylon Yarn. It was held by the Central Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi by its order dated 5th April, 1991 that the case put forward by the appellant with regard to the classification of the goods imported by it was correct and the amount which had been demanded by the Revenue, which had been paid by the appellant under protest should be returned to the appellant upon production of evidence of end use of the imported yarn in the manufacturing of belting to the satisfaction of the concerned Assistant Collector.

4. In pursuance of the above order, the appellant filed a refund claim along with relevant documents, for Rs.17,35,119/-, the amount which was paid by way of duty under protest in respect of the nylon yarn which was imported by the appellant during the period commencing from February, 1987 to February, 1988.

5. As the amount of refund had not been paid in pursuance of the refund claim made by the appellant, the appellant was constrained to file Writ Petition No.5185 of 1993 before the High Court of Bombay praying for a direction that the aforestated amount be refunded along with interest thereon to the appellant. The said petition was allowed and by virtue of an order dated 19th April, 1994, the High Court had directed the Revenue to take appropriate action for making payment of the refund of Rs.17.35 lacs within three months from the date of the order to the appellant.

6. After the aforestated order was passed by the High Court, the Assistant Collector of Central Excise issued a show cause notice dated 27.04.1994 calling upon the appellant to show cause as to why the application claiming refund should not be rejected on the ground of unjust enrichment as the amount of tax was alleged to have been recovered by the appellant from M/s. Coal India Ltd. and M/s. Singarani Collieries Co. Ltd., to whom the goods had been supplied by the appellant.

7. In pursuance of the aforestated show cause notice, the appellant had given its reply on 9th May, 1994 giving details to the effect that the amount of duty paid had never been recovered from the aforestated two units which were substantially controlled by the Government. Necessary evidence was also adduced and even the aforestated two units also confirmed the fact that the aforestated amount of duty paid by the appellant had not been collected from them. The said reply was duly considered by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad and thereupon he passed a final order dated 5th April, 1995 whereby he had come to the following conclusion, as recorded in his order: “I have gone through the records of the case carefully. As regards end use of nylon yarn, the jurisdictional range Supdt. has certified that the raw material i.e. nylon yarn imported under the said B/E has been used in the manufacture of the conveyor belting.

As regards unjust enrichment, party submitted that their contracts were fixed price contract and were without any escalation clause and were signed even before the dispute arose about the custom duty. M/s. Singarani Collieries Co. Ltd. and M/s. Coal India Ltd. have also certified that they have not paid any extra price due to increase in custom duty. Thus, it emerges that since duty is paid under protest, therefore, the limitation u/s 27 of C.A. is not applicable to subject refund claim.

i) The refund claim is admissible on merit;

ii) The refund claim is also admissible on the limitation period;

iii) Also the excess duty incidence has not been passed on by the assessee on their buyers.” The aforestated facts, as recorded by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad clearly reveal that the amount of duty claimed by way of refund had not been collected by the appellant from the above named two buyers who had purchased conveyor belting from the appellant.

8. It is, however, strange that the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad passed the following final order:

“I hereby sanction the refund u/s 27 of C.A. – 1962 claim for Rs.17,35,119/- with a condition that the party should give an undertaking that they will pay back money to the Government in case Supreme Court decides the SLP No.2332/92 U.O.I. Vs. M/s. Solar Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. in favour of the Department.”
9. Apparently, there was no issue of captive consumption in the instant case and yet the appellant was directed to file an undertaking as stated hereinabove in the order. Being in need of money, the appellant filed an undertaking under protest, though, in our opinion, it was not necessary for the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad to ask for such an undertaking. Be that as it may, the said order was not challenged by anybody and therefore, it attained finality.

10. Ultimately, this Court decided SLP No.2332/92, Union of India vs. M/s. Solar Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. and the judgment delivered in the said case has been reported at page no.705 of 2000 (2) SCC.

11. In our opinion, the aforestated judgment is not at all relevant so far as the appellant’s case is concerned. However, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent had made a feeble effort to correlate the aforestated judgment and the facts of the case of the appellant. We do not agree with the submissions made by the learned counsel for the respondent for the reason that Union of India Vs. M/s. Solar Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is a case where incidence of duty had been passed over to the buyer, whereas in the instant case it is an admitted fact, even as recorded by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad that the incidence of duty had not been passed over to the purchaser of the furnished goods. In spite of the aforestated fact, by a show cause notice dated 3rd March, 2003 the appellant was called upon to pay the amount which had been refunded to the appellant in pursuance of the undertaking filed by the appellant as per order dated 5th April, 1995 passed by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad. The aforestated show cause notice dated 3rd March, 2003 was replied to by the appellant on 3rd April, 2003 and thereupon by an order dated 14th July, 2003 the said show cause notice had been dropped.

12. The order dated 14th July, 2003, whereby the show cause notice dated 3rd March, 2003 had been dropped, was taken into review and by an order dated 31st March, 2004 the said review was allowed and thereby once again the appellant was asked to pay the amount which had already been refunded to it.

13. The said order dated 31st March, 2004 was challenged by the appellant before the Tribunal and the Tribunal was pleased to dismiss the said appeal and the impugned order of dismissal dated 6th September, 2004 has been challenged by the appellant in this appeal.

14. Upon hearing the concerned counsel and looking at the facts of the case, it is very clear that it is an admitted fact that the amount of duty paid by the appellant had never been passed over to the purchasers and the said fact has been duly recorded by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad in his order dated 5th April, 1995. The said order has attained finality as nobody challenged the said order. An undertaking, though strictly not required to be given, was given by the appellant as demanded under the aforestated order dated 5th April, 1995 and ultimately the amount had been refunded to the appellant. In our opinion, there is no question of demanding the said amount again, especially when the facts which had been disputed by the Revenue before the Tribunal had already been admitted in the proceedings which had been initiated by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad in his order dated 5th April, 1995. We are not in agreement with the findings arrived at by the Tribunal which are contrary to the facts recorded by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad. Unfortunately, the said order has not been referred to at all by the Tribunal. Without disturbing the findings arrived at by the Deputy Collector, Central Excise and Customs, Aurangabad in his order dated 5th April, 1995, the Revenue could not have come to an altogether different conclusion on facts. In our opinion, due efforts were made to find out whether the amount of duty had been passed over to the purchasers, who are either government Companies or Corporations controlled by the Government. It has been clearly stated in the aforestated order dated 5th April, 1995 that even the purchasers had admitted the fact that the amount of duty paid by the appellant had not been passed over to the said purchasers or in other words, the said amount of duty had not been recovered from the said purchasers.

15. We fail to understand as to how the judgment delivered in U.O.I. Vs. M/s. Solar Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is applicable to the case of the appellant. Neither this is a case of captive consumption nor is a case of unjust enrichment.

16. For the aforesaid reasons, we quash and set aside the impugned order passed by the Tribunal dated 6th September, 2004. The appeal is allowed with costs. Looking at the hardship suffered by the appellant, in our opinion, it would be just and proper to award an amount of Rs.25,000/- as costs and the said amount shall be paid to the appellant within three months from the date of this order by the respondent authority.",1
Arikala Narasa Reddy,"These appeals have been preferred against the impugned judgment and order dated 20.7.2012, as amended vide order dated 23.7.2012, of the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in Election Petition No.2 of 2009 and Recrimination Petition No.1 of 2009.

2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are that:-

A. An election was held on 30.3.2009 for 18-Nizamabad Local Authority Constituency of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council wherein the appellant stood declared as successful candidate and had since then been a Member of Legislative Council (MLC).

B. The respondent no.1, defeated candidate, filed Election Petition No.2 of 2009 on the ground that certain invalid votes had been counted in favour of the appellant and certain valid votes which were cast in favour of the respondent no.1 had wrongly been declared invalid.

C. The election petition was to be decided on the basis of the fact that election for the said post was held on 30.3.2009 wherein out of 706 total votes, 701 votes were cast.

D. The votes were counted on 2.4.2009 and initially both the contesting candidates are said to have got equal number of votes as 336 each while 29 votes were found invalid.

E. On the application of the appellant herein, the Returning Officer allowed re-counting of all the votes wherein the appellant got 336 votes and the respondent no.1 secured 335 votes and 30 votes were found to be invalid and therefore, the appellant was declared to be the successful candidate and elected as MLC by a margin of one vote.

F. The election petition was filed mainly on the ground that 3 votes in question Ex.X-1 to X-3 polled in favour of the respondent no.1 had been wrongly rejected and one vote Ex.Y-13 which had been counted in favour of the appellant ought to have been declared invalid.

G. The High Court issued notice to the appellant regarding the lodgment of the election petition and the appellant not only entered appearance but also filed a Recrimination Petition No.1 of 2009 under Section 97 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’).

H. The appellant filed the written statement refuting the allegations and averments made in the petition.

I. The respondent no.2, Returning Officer also filed his written statement and it appears that during the pendency of the election petition vide order dated 23.9.2011, the High Court directed the Registrar (Judicial), High Court of Andhra Pradesh to scrutinize and re-count all the ballot papers in the presence of the parties and their counsel as per the rules and regulations, and the instructions and guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India and submit a report within a stipulated period.

J. Aggrieved, the appellant challenged the said order by filing Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.29095 of 2011 and this Court vide an order dated 20.10.2011 set aside the impugned order of the High Court and directed to first determine the question relating to the validity of the 3 disputed votes and, thereafter, to examine the issue of re-counting of all the votes, if required.

K. The High Court, in pursuance of the order of this Court, scrutinized and examined the 3 disputed votes in question in the presence of the parties and their counsel from the bundle of disputed votes, and after identifying them with the assistance of the parties and their counsel, had taken the photocopies thereof. The said photocopies were supplied to the parties and were marked as Ex.X-1, X- 2 and X-3.

L. The High Court scrutinized and examined the 3 votes on 24.1.2012 and came to the conclusion that the Returning Officer had wrongly rejected the said 3 votes as invalid and ordered that all the 3 disputed votes to be counted in favour of respondent no.1.

M. Aggrieved, the appellant challenged the said order dated 24.1.2012 by filing Special Leave Petition (C) No.4728 of 2012 and this Court disposed of the said SLP on 7.2.2012 observing that it was not appropriate to interfere at that stage but the appellant would be at liberty to urge the same point at the time of final hearing. Thus, this Court did not interfere with the same being an interim order.

N. The High Court during the trial of the election petition picked up 17 ballot papers from the bundle of rejected ballot papers as determined by the Returning Officer and marked the same as Ex.Y-1 to Y-

17. The High Court also picked up 2 ballot papers from the valid votes of the appellant and marked the same as Ex.R-1 and R-2. Four ballot papers were picked up from the valid votes of respondent no.1 and marked as Ex.P-16 to P-19. After considering all these ballot papers, the High Court vide judgment and order dated 20.7.2012 allowed the election petition holding that certain votes cast in favour of respondent no.1 had wrongly been rejected and the vote which should have been declared as invalid had wrongly been counted in favour of the appellant as valid and thus, the respondent no.1 was declared as successful candidate and elected as MLC. The operation of the aforesaid judgment dated 20.7.2012 was stayed only for a period of 4 weeks to enable the appellant to approach this Court.

Hence, these appeals.

3. Shri B. Adinarayana Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that the election petition has not been decided by the High Court giving strict adherence to the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed for this purpose. It was not permissible for the High Court to go beyond the pleadings of the election petition. The entire controversy could only be in respect of 3 votes as pleaded in the election petition by the respondent no.1 which had been declared invalid and another vote which ought to have been declared invalid but had been counted in favour of the appellant as valid. It was not permissible for the High Court to count all the votes and pick up large number of votes from the bundle of invalid votes, totaling 30, or from the valid votes duly counted in favour of the appellant or the respondent no.1. Counting has to take place strictly in accordance with the rules and there was no occasion for the court to find out the intention of the voters or draw an inference in whose favour the elector wanted to vote. More so, the petition filed by the appellant had not been decided in the correct perspective. Therefore, the appeals deserve to be allowed.

4. Per contra, Shri P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents has vehemently opposed the appeals contending that even if the case is restricted to aforesaid 4 votes, as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant, the result so declared by the High Court is not materially affected. The Returning Officer had committed an error in declaring the 3 valid votes in favour of the respondent no.1 as invalid and miscounted one vote as valid. Thus, in such a fact-situation, the intention of the elector has to be inferred in view of the statutory rules and executive instructions issued by the Election Commission for counting the ballot papers. Therefore, the judgment delivered by the High Court can by no means be termed as perverse and no interference is called for. The appeals lack merit and are liable to be dismissed.

5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

6. Section 87 of the Act provides that the election petition is to be tried by the High Court applying the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CPC’) “as nearly as may be” and in accordance with the procedure applicable under CPC and the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Evidence Act’) shall also be applicable subject to the provisions of the Act.

7. It is a settled legal proposition that the statutory requirements relating to election law have to be strictly adhered to for the reason that an election dispute is a statutory proceeding unknown to the common law and thus, the doctrine of equity, etc. does not apply in such dispute. All the technicalities prescribed/mandated in election law have been provided to safeguard the purity of the election process and courts have a duty to enforce the same with all rigours and not to minimize their operation. A right to be elected is neither a fundamental right nor a common law right, though it may be very fundamental to a democratic set-up of governance. Therefore, answer to every question raised in election dispute is to be solved within the four corners of the statute. The result announced by the Returning Officer leads to formation of a government which requires the stability and continuity as an essential feature in election process and therefore, the counting of ballots is not to be interfered with frequently. More so, secrecy of ballot which is sacrosanct gets exposed if recounting of votes is made easy. The court has to be more careful when the margin between the contesting candidates is very narrow. “Looking for numerical good fortune or windfall of chance discovery of illegal rejection or reception of ballots must be avoided, as it may tend to a dangerous disorientation which invades the democratic order by providing scope for reopening of declared results”. However, a genuine apprehension of mis-count or illegality and other compulsions of justice may require the recourse to a drastic step.

8. Before the court permits the recounting, the following conditions must be satisfied:

(i) The court must be satisfied that a prima facie case is established;
(ii) The material facts and full particulars have been pleaded stating the irregularities in counting of votes;
(iii) A roving and fishing inquiry should not be directed by way of an order to re-count the votes;
(iv) An opportunity should be given to file objection; and
(v) Secrecy of the ballot should be guarded.
9. This Court has consistently held that the court cannot go beyond the pleadings of the parties. The parties have to take proper pleadings and establish by adducing evidence that by a particular irregularity/illegality, the result of the election has been “materially affected”. There can be no dispute to the settled legal proposition that “as a rule relief not founded on the pleadings should not be granted”. Thus, a decision of the case should not be based on grounds outside the pleadings of the parties. In absence of pleadings, evidence if any, produced by the parties, cannot be considered. It is also a settled legal proposition that no party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleadings and parties are bound to take all necessary and material facts in support of the case set up by them. Pleadings ensure that each side is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised and they may have an opportunity of placing the relevant evidence before the court for its consideration. The issues arise only when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and denied by the other party. Therefore, it is neither desirable nor permissible for a court to frame an issue not arising on the pleadings. The court cannot exercise discretion of ordering recounting of ballots just to enable the election petitioner to indulge in a roving inquiry with a view to fish material for dealing the election to be void. The order of recounting can be passed only if the petitioner sets out his case with precision supported by averments of material facts. (Vide: Ram Sewak Yadav v. Hussain Kamil Kidwai & Ors., AIR 1964 SC 1249; Bhabhi v. Sheo Govind & Ors., AIR 1975 SC 2117; and M. Chinnasamy v. K.C. Palanisamy & Ors., (2004) 6 SCC 341).

10. There may be an exceptional case where the parties proceed to trial fully knowing the rival case and lead all the evidence not only in support of their contentions, but in refutation of the case set up by the other side. Only in such circumstances, absence of an issue may not be fatal and a party may not be permitted to submit that there has been a mis-trial and the proceedings stood vitiated. (Vide: Kalyan Singh Chouhan v. C.P. Joshi, AIR 2011 SC 1127).

11. The secrecy of a ballot is to be preserved in view of the statutory provision contained in Section 94 of the Act. Secrecy of ballot has always been treated as sacrosanct and indispensable adjunct of free and fair election. Such principle of secrecy is based on public policy aimed to ensure that voter may vote without fear or favour and is free from any apprehension of its disclosure against his will.

In the case of S. Raghbir Singh Gill v. S. Gurcharan Singh Tohra & Ors., AIR 1980 SC 1362, a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the aspect of secrecy of vote and held that such policy is for the benefit of the voters to enable them to cast their vote freely. However, where a benefit, even though based on public policy, is granted to a person, it is open for that person and no one else to wave of such benefit. The very concept of privilege inheres a right to wave it. (See also: Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India & Ors., AIR 2006 SC 3127; and People’s Union for Civil Liberties & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr., (2013) 10 SCC 1).

12. We find some force in the contention of Shri P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.1 that though secrecy of ballot is an inherent principle in conducting elections, however, the said principle has diminished to some extent in view of the rule of whip as prescribed in Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India.

13. The issue of marking and writing on ballot papers is governed by the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as `Rules’). Rule 73(2) of the Rules reads as under:

“73. Scrutiny and opening of ballot boxes and the packets of postal ballot papers: 
(1) xx xx xx (2) A ballot paper shall be invalid on which- 
(a) the figure ‘1’ is not marked; or 
(b) the figure ‘1’ is set opposite the name of more than one candidate or is so placed as to render it doubtful to which candidate it is intended to apply; or  
(c) the figure ‘1’ and some other figures are set opposite the name of the same candidate; or
(d) there is any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified.  
xx xx xx”
14. In Dr. Anup Singh v. Shri Abdul Ghani & Anr., AIR 1965 SC 815, a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the provisions of Rule 73(2)(d) which provides that a ballot paper shall be invalid if “there is any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified”. The Court observed as under:
“10…Thus there are three possible interpretations of the words ""by which the elector can be identified"" appearing in Rule 73(2)(d), namely (i) any mark or writing which might possibly lead to the identification of the elector, (ii) such mark or writing as can reasonably and probably lead to the identification of the elector, and (iii) the mark or writing should be connected by evidence aliened with an elector and it should be shown that the elector is actually identified by such mark or writing.
11. ….When the legislature provided that the mark or writing should be such that the elector can be identified thereby it was not providing for a mere possibility of identification. On this construction almost every additional mark or writing would fall within the mischief of the provision. If that was the intention the words would have been different,….
12. We are further of opinion that the third construction on which the appellant relies also cannot be accepted. If the intention of the legislature was that only such votes should be invalidated in which the elector was actually identified because of the mark or writing, the legislature would not have used the words ""the mark or writing by which the elector can be identified"". These words in our opinion do not mean that there must be an actual identification of the elector by the mark or writing before the vote can be invalidated. If such was the intention of the legislature clause (d) would have read something like ""any mark or writing which identifies the elector"". But the words used are ""any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified"", and these words in our opinion mean something more than a mere possibility of identification but do not require actual proof of identification before the vote can be invalidated, though by such proof, when offered, the disability would be attracted.”
15. Similarly, in Era Sezhiyan v. T.R. Balu & Ors., AIR 1990 SC 838, this Court after considering Rule 73(2) of the Rules held as under:
“14…Sub-rule (2) of rule 73 of the Election Rules set out earlier that a ballot paper shall be invalid on which there is any figure marked otherwise than with the article supplied for the purpose. Rule 73 is directly applicable to the case of the election in question and as aforesaid it prescribes that if on the ballot paper there is any figure marked otherwise than with the article supplied for the purpose, the ballot paper shall be invalid. Assuming that the voter in this case had expressed his intention clearly by marking the figure I in green ink, he did so in violation of the express provisions of the Rules which have a statutory force and hence no effect can be given to that intention.” (Emphasis added) While considering the case, this Court placed reliance upon its earlier judgment in Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque & Ors., AIR 1955 SC 233.
16. In Km. Shradha Devi v. Krishna Chandra Pant & Ors., AIR 1982 SC 1569, this Court considered the provisions of Rule 73(2)(d) of the Rules and held as under:
“A ballot paper shall be invalid on which there is any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified. Section 94 of the Act ensures secrecy of ballot and it cannot be infringed because no witness or other person shall be required to state for whom he has voted at an election. Section 94 was interpreted by this Court in Raghubir Singh Gill (supra), to confer a privilege upon the voter not to be compelled to disclose how and for whom he voted. To ensure free and fair election which is pivotal for setting up a parliamentary democracy, this vital principle was enacted in Section 94 to ensure that a voter would be able to vote uninhibited by any fear or any undesirable consequence of disclosure of how he voted. As a corollary it is provided that if there is any mark or writing on the ballot paper which enables the elector to be identified, the ballot paper would be rejected as invalid. But the mark or writing must be such as would unerringly lead to the identity of the voter.”
17. If all the judgments referred to hereinabove in respect of interpreting the provisions of Rule 73(2)(d) are conjointly considered, we are of the opinion that there must be some casual connection between the mark and the identity of the voter and such writing or marking itself must reasonably give indication of the voter’s identity. As to whether such marking or writing in a particular case would disclose the identity of the voter, would depend on the nature of writing or marking on the ballot involved in each case. Therefore, such marking or writing must be such as to draw an inference about the identity of the voter. To that extent, with all humility at our command, we have to say that word “unerringly” used by this Court in Km. Shradha Devi (supra) is not in consonance with the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Dr. Anup Singh (supra).
18. This brings us to the next question involved herein as to whether election petition and recrimination petition have to be tried simultaneously.

In a composite election petition wherein the petitioner claims not only that the election of the returned candidate is void but also that the petitioner or some other person be declared to have been duly elected, Section 97 of the Act comes into play and allows the returned candidate to recriminate and raise counter-pleas in support of his case, ""but the pleas of the returned candidate under Section 97 have to be tried after a declaration has been made under Section 100 of the Act.” The first part of the enquiry is in regard to the validity of the election of the returned candidate which is to be tried within the narrow limits prescribed by Section 100 (1) (d) (iii) while the latter part of the enquiry governed by Section 101 (a) will have to be tried on a broader basis permitting the returned candidate to lead evidence in support of the pleas taken by him in his recrimination petition. If the returned candidate does not recriminate as required by Section 97, then he cannot make any attack against the alternative claim made by the election petitioner. In such a case an enquiry would be held under Section 100 so far as the validity of the returned candidate's election is concerned, and if as a result of the said enquiry, declaration is made that the election of the returned candidate is void, then the Tribunal will proceed to deal with the alternative claim, but in doing so, the returned candidate will not be allowed to lead any evidence because he is precluded from raising any pleas against the validity of the claim of the alternative candidate. (Vide: Jabar Singh v. Genda Lal, AIR 1964 SC 1200; Ram Autar Singh Bhadauria v. Ram Gopal Singh & Ors., AIR 1975 SC 2182; and Bhag Mal v. Ch. Parbhu Ram & Ors., AIR 1985 SC 150).

19. The instant case requires to be considered in light of the above settled legal propositions.

In the instant case, as explained hereinabove, there were 706 total votes, out of which 701 votes were polled. At the time of initial counting on 2.4.2009, both the candidates got equal votes as 336 and 29 votes were found invalid. On the request of the appellant, the Returning Officer permitted recounting of the votes and the appellant got 336 votes while the respondent no.1 got 335 votes and 30 votes were found to be invalid. In the election petition, the only grounds had been that 3 votes i.e. Ex.X-1 to X-3 polled in favour of respondent no.1 which had wrongly been rejected and one vote Ex.Y-13 which had been counted in favour of the appellant ought to have been declared invalid.

20. In view of the pleadings in the election petition, the case should have been restricted only to these four votes and even if the recrimination petition is taken into account, there could have been no occasion for the High Court to direct recounting of all the votes and in case certain discrepancies were found out in recounting of votes by the Registrar of the High Court as per the direction of the High Court, it was not permissible for the High Court to take into consideration all such discrepancies and decide the election petition or recrimination petition on the basis thereof. The course adopted by the High Court is impermissible and cannot be taken note of being in contravention with statutory requirements. Therefore, the case has to be restricted only to the four votes in the election petition and the allegations made in the recrimination petition ignoring altogether what had been found out in the recounting of votes as under no circumstance the recounting of votes at that stage was permissible.

21. We have been taken through the judgment of the High Court as well as the record of the election petition including photocopies of the ballot papers in question.

22. Prayer of the election petition reads as under:

a) To declare the election of respondent no.1 to the Legislative Council 18-Nizamabad Local Authority Constituency, Nizamabad held on 30.3.2009 as illegal and void;
b) To direct recounting and scrutiny of the ballot papers and validate three votes cast in favour of the petitioner;
c) To declare one vote cast in favour of the respondent no.1 as invalid;
d) To set aside the election of the first respondent as the member of the Legislative Council from 18-Nizamabad Local Authority Constituency;
e) To declare the petitioner as elected to the Legislative Council of the State of Andhra Pradesh from 18-Nizamabad Local Authority Constituency in the election held on 30.3.2009;
f) To award costs of the petition.
23. The particulars as per the election petition in respect of the aforesaid facts had been as under:

a) one vote was polled in favour of the petitioner by marking figure ‘1’, but the same was doubted as it looked like ‘7’ and was kept under doubtful votes.
b) One vote which was polled in favour of the petitioner by marking figure ‘1’ was doubted on the ground that it looked like ‘dot’.
c) One vote which was polled in favour of the petitioner by marking figure ‘1’ was treated as doubtful vote on the ground that the name of the petitioner, the contesting candidate was written on the ballot paper.
24. On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues were framed:

1. Whether the petitioner has got a prima facie case to an order of scrutiny and recounting of ballot papers as prayed for in the election petition?
2. Whether three (3) votes polled in favour of the petitioner as set out in paras 10 and 11 of the election petition are improperly refused or rejected?
3. Whether one (1) vote improperly received and counted in favour of the returned candidate as set out in para 10 of the election petition?
4. Whether the election of the returned candidate has been materially affected by improper refusal or rejection of three (3) votes polled in favour of the election petitioner and improper reception of one (1) vote in favour of returned candidate as stated in paras 10 and 11 of the election petition?
5. Whether the election of the respondent/returned candidate has to be declared as void?
6. To what relief?
25. It is a settled legal proposition that the instructions contained in the handbook for Returning Officer are issued by the Election Commission in exercise of its statutory functions and are therefore, binding on the Returning Officers. Such a view stands fortified by various judgments of this Court in Ram Sukh v. Dinesh Aggarwal, AIR 2010 SC 1227; and Uttamrao Shivdas Jankar v. Ranjitsinh Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, AIR 2009 SC 2975. Instruction 16 of the Handbook deals with cases as to when the ballot is not to be rejected. The Returning Officers are bound by the Rules and such instructions in counting the ballot as has been done in this case.

26. The High Court had examined the votes in dispute and came to the following findings:

“Coming to Ex.X-1, the figure ‘1’ is clearly marked by the voter in the panel meant for the petitioner in the ballot paper. Though, it was not in the space which is actually meant for marking figure ‘1’, since it is in the panel (space) provided for the petitioner, it has to be treated as valid. This was also, however, objected to by the first respondent that it looks like ‘7’ and not ‘1’. But, it would clearly appear that the voter marked the figure ‘1’ and there is a small extension towards left of the said figure on the top. The learned counsel appearing for the first respondent would contend that the intention of the voter is absolutely no relevance since the rules specifically state that the figure ‘1’ has to be put. While discussing the rules and referring to the judicial pronouncements, I have already held that a duty is cast upon the Returning Officer as well as the court to ascertain the intention of the voter. As long as the figure marked resembles ‘1’, it is illegal to reject the ballot mechanically whenever a doubt arises that the figure marked does not accord in all respects with the figure viewed by the Returning Officer or the court. This ballot, however, clearly shows that the figure ‘1’ was specifically and correctly marked and therefore, the Returning Officer rightly validated the said vote in favour of the petitioner.
In Ex.X-2, the voter marked figure ‘1’ in the panel meant for the petitioner. It was objected to by the first respondent that it looks like ‘dot’. On careful examination, I found that the voter in fact marked figure ‘1’, but it is short in length and the width appears to be more because of the discharge of more ink from the instrument supplied to the elector by the Returning Officer for the purpose of marking. According to me, this was improperly rejected by the Returning Officer saying that it looks like ‘dot’, but not one. By carefully examining the ballot paper unhesitatingly, I hold that the voter marked figure ‘1’ and it has to be validated in favour of the petitioner and accordingly, the same is validated for the petitioner.
                          xxx                    xxx                    xxx
           xxx

In Ex.X-3, a ‘tick’ mark was put in the column meant for the first respondent in addition to figure ‘1’ which was clearly put in the space meant for the petitioner. This apart, the voter wrote that his vote is for ‘Venkata Ram Reddy’ (petitioner). By the said writing, it is not possible to identify the voter. From the writing, it is also not possible to draw any inference that there was prior arrangement between the petitioner and the voter to write those words. It is also not possible to presume that the writing furnishes any reasonable or probable information or evidence to find out the identity of the voter. As regards the ‘tick’ mark since such mark is not contemplated by the rules it has to be ignored. For all these reasons, since the figure ‘1’ was clearly put by the voter, it has to be validated in favour of the petitioner. Accordingly, the same is validated in favour of the petitioner.
xxx xxx xxx xxx As regards Ex.Y-13, it requires to be noticed that the figure ‘1’ was clearly and specifically put in the column meant for the petitioner. However, the elector in the space provided for the petitioner for marking the figure put his signature apart from marking figure ‘1’. From the signature also it is not possible to trace out the identity of the voter and therefore, this vote also can be validated in favour of the petitioner and accordingly, it is validated in favour of the petitioner.”
27. In view of the above, the High Court concluded the trial of the election petition declaring the respondent elected by margin of two votes as he secured 338 votes, while the appellant secured 336 votes.

28. We have gone through the record of the case including the four disputed ballots i.e. Ex. X-1 to 3 and Ex.Y-13 with the help of the learned counsel for the parties. We agree with the reasoning given by the High Court with respect to Ex. X-1 and 2. However, Ex.X-3 has to be held to be an invalid ballot because of the ambiguity and the additional marking i.e. “his vote is for Venkata Rama Reddy” on it. Further, though the elector has put the mark ‘1’ in front of the name of the respondent no. 1, however, he has also put a tick mark in front of the name of the appellant. Therefore, it is impossible to make out in whose favour the elector has voted and hence, this ballot is rejected as being invalid.

29. As regards Ex.Y-13, the voter has, in addition to putting the mark ‘1’ in front of the name of the respondent no. 1, put his signature as well. The said signature is legible and distinguishable and keeping in mind that only 701 votes were polled, it would not be difficult to identify the elector and, thus, the ballot is invalid being hit by Rule 73 (2) (d) of the Rules.

30. In view of the above, after modification of the impugned judgment and order, the appellant and the respondent no.1 get equal number of votes i.e. 336 votes each. Therefore, the judgment and order of the High Court insofar as it relates to allowing the election petition is modified to that extent.

31. In such a fact-situation provisions of Section 102 of the Act have to be resorted to, however, as the result of the election stood materially affected, we may first consider the recrimination petition filed by the appellant. In the recrimination petition, the appellant had raised the following issues:

“(a) ?That one vote marked as ‘7’ was illegally counted in favour of the 1st Respondent herein by the 2nd Respondent in spite of the objections raised by the petitioner at the time of counting and a written application to reject the said vote was filed by the petitioner herein.
(b) The 2nd Respondent has illegally counted one vote in favour of the 1st Respondent though the figure ‘9’ was marked on the ballot paper and though it is clearly looking as ‘9’.
(c) The 2nd Respondent has illegally rejected one vote which is validly polled in favour of the petitioner herein on the ground that the voter has put '2' after the figure '1' in the column allotted to the petitioner. According to law, the 2nd Respondent has to treat that vote as valid and counted in favour of the petitioner herein in whose favour '1' is put on the ballot paper and by ignoring the subsequent figure.
(d) The 2nd Respondent has illegally rejected some other votes validly polled in favour of the petitioner on flimsy and untenable grounds.”
32. As regards the ground (d) it is to be noticed that the same is non-descriptive and vague. Any ground raised in a recrimination petition has to be specific and the court cannot be asked to make a roving and fishing enquiry on the mere asking of a party. Thus, ground

(d) is not worth consideration.

33. Coming to ground (a), the same relates to Ex.P-19. The appellant has claimed that on the said ballot mark `7’ had been put which was treated as mark `1’ and counted in favour of the respondent no. 1. On a careful examination of the said exhibit, it is to be held that though the same may appear to be `7’ but it is also another form of writing `1’ and thus, there was no illegality committed by the Returning Officer in holding the same in favour of the respondent no.

1. Ground (b) relates to Ex.P-16, wherein one long stroke is made to make a mark denoting the number `1’. However, on the upper side of the stroke there is also a small curve connecting the stroke. The appellant has claimed that due to the said curve the figure on the ballot is in fact `9’ and, hence, should have been declared invalid. The contention is noted just to be rejected as such a figure is to be read only as `1’ for it is impossible to take such a technical and impractical view. If all the ballots are started to be scrutinized and examined in such a hyper technical manner then most of the ballots would only stand rejected. Hence, we hold that the mark `1’ is made on Ex.P-16 and the same is to be counted in favour of respondent no. 1 as has been done.

34. However, Ex.Y-11 is to be declared as invalid. Not only is there scribbling on the said ballot but the final mark that is made on the ballot is `2’ which is in direct conflict with Rule 73(2)(a) of the Rules and hence, the Returning Officer rightly rejected the same.

35. In view of the above, we reach the inescapable conclusion that even after deciding the Recrimination Petition, the appellant and the respondent no.1 have received equal number of votes.

36. In such a fact-situation the decision as to who will be the returned candidate is to be decided by the draw of lots by virtue of the provisions of Section 102 of the Act.

37. In view of the above, in the presence of all the learned counsel for the parties we have drawn the lots in the open Court and by draw of lots, the appellant succeeds.

38. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly in favour of appellant. No costs",0
RAMESHCHANDRA AMBALAL JOSHI,"According to the complainant-respondent No. 2, the accused- petitioner, Rameshchandra Ambalal Joshi was his friend, who had taken a loan of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac only) from the complainant. The petitioner issued a cheque dated 31st of December, 2005 towards repayment of the loan. The cheque presented for payment by the complainant on 30th of June, 2006 was dishonoured on the ground of insufficiency of funds on the same day. A registered notice dated 25th of July, 2006 was then sent by the complainant to which the petitioner replied. The complainant then filed Criminal Case No. 2146 of 2006 on 5th of September, 2006 alleging commission of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Borsad, who took cognizance of the offence and issued summons to the petitioner.

An application for discharge was filed by the petitioner before the trial court inter alia contending that as a period of six months had lapsed between the date of drawl of the cheque on 31st of December, 2005 and its presentation by the complainant on 30th of June, 2006 for payment, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted. The prayer of the petitioner was rejected by the trial court on its finding that the provisions of discharge were not applicable to the present proceeding, they being in the nature of summons trial.

A criminal revision application against the aforesaid order, filed by the petitioner before the Court of Sessions, Anand was rejected by an order dated 5th of May, 2009, which the petitioner assailed in a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court. The High Court by its order dated 20th of August, 2010 rejected the application of the petitioner, observing as under:

“7. Though the submission has been made by the learned counsel, Mr. Hakim raising the contention with regard to the limitation, bare perusal of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, would make it clear that what law provides is presentation within a period of six months, meaning thereby, the Legislature has provided the period of six months by way of limitation. It is also clear that each month may not have same number of days and, therefore, wisely what has been provided in terms of months and not exact date or days, meaning thereby, 180 days. Therefore, cheque drawn on the last date of month of December would remain valid for a period of six months and the period of six months would expire after the last date of June i.e. 30th June, 2006. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, as the cheque has already been presented on 30th June, 2006, it cannot be said that it is barred by limitation. Therefore, the submission made by the learned counsel, Hakim cannot be readily accepted.” It is against this order that the petitioner has preferred this special leave petition.
Leave granted.
Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel draws our attention to proviso (a) of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and contends that to attract its mischief the cheque is required to be presented in the Bank within six months from the date of its drawl. Otherwise, Section 138 of the Act would not apply. Section 138 of the Act, which is relevant for our purpose reads as follows:

“138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account.- Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both:
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply unless-
a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;
xxx xxx xxx” We are in agreement with Mr. Ahmadi and, in fact, it is apparent from a plain reading of proviso (a) aforesaid that Section 138 of the Act would apply only when the cheque is presented to the Bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within period of its validity, whichever is earlier.
Mr. Ahmadi then points out that the cheque is valid from the date it is drawn and hence period of six months has to be calculated from the said date. On facts, he points out that the cheque was drawn on 31st of December, 2005 and presented on 30th of June, 2006, which is beyond the period of six months. He submits that cheque is valid from the date shown in it and therefore for calculation of six months, the date on which the cheque is drawn has to be included. He has suggested the following two modes of calculation:

To put the record straight, the modes suggested, in fact, do not reflect his submission. He, however, submits that whichever mode is adopted, the cheque was not presented within the period of six months. In support of the submission, he has placed reliance on a decision of the Kerala High Court in the case of K.V. Muhammed Kunhi vs. P. Janardhanan [1998 CRL.L.J. 4330] and our attention has been drawn to the following passage from the said judgment:

“3. ………..A comparative study of both the Sections in the Act and the General Clauses Act significantly indicate that the period of limitation has to be reckoned from the date on which the cheque or instrument was drawn. The words ‘from’ and ‘to’ employed in Section 9 of the General Clauses Act are evidently clear that in cases where there is an ambiguity or suspicion with reference to the date of commencement of period of limitation in any Act or special enactment, the words ‘from’ and ‘to’ employed in Section 9 of the General Clauses Act can be pressed into service. But in the instant case before me, Section 138 proviso (a) is involved which is so clear (as extracted above) that the date of limitation will commence only from the date found in the cheque or the instrument.” Mr. Ahmadi submits that the aforesaid view has been approved by this Court in the case of Sivakumar vs. Natarajan (2009) 13 SCC 623 in the following words:
“14. ………..A comparative study of both the Sections in the Act and the General Clauses Act significantly indicate that the period of limitation has to be reckoned from the date on which the cheque or instrument was drawn. The words ‘from’ and ‘to’ employed in Section 9 of the General Clauses Act are evidently clear that in cases where there is an ambiguity or suspicion with reference to the date of commencement of period of limitation in any Act or special enactment, the words ‘from and ‘to’ employed in Section 9 of the General Clauses Act can be pressed into service.
We are in agreement with the aforementioned view.” It may look like a repetition of the judgment but its relevance would be apparent from what we have observed in the subsequent paragraphs of this judgement.
Given the general importance of the question involved, we had requested Mr. V.Giri, learned Senior Counsel, to assist us as amicus curiae and he very generously agreed to do so. We have also heard Ms. Hemantika Wahi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents.

They contend that the period of six months had expired on 30th of June, 2006 i.e. the date on which the cheque was presented, which is within six months from the date it was drawn. They submit that as a general rule, in case of any ambiguity, Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides for exclusion of the first day and inclusion of the last day for the purpose of calculating commencement or termination of time. They submit that the date of issue of cheque, i.e. 31st of December,2005 is to be excluded and the last day, i.e. 30th of June, 2006 is to be included for the purpose of calculating the period of six months under proviso (a) of Section 138 of the Act. According to the learned counsel, since the last day of the six months’ period was 30th of June, 2006 and the cheque was presented on that very same day, the complaint under Section 138 of the Act is not time barred.

We have given our most anxious consideration to the submissions advanced and we do not find any substance in the submission of Mr. Ahmadi that the cheque was not presented to the Bank within a period of six months from the date on which it was drawn and the judgments relied on go against him instead of supporting his contention.

The first question which calls for our answer is the meaning of the expression “month”: whether it would mean only a period of 30 days and, consequently, whether six months would mean a period of 180 days. The word “month” has been defined under Section 3(35) of the General Clauses Act to mean a month reckoned according to the British calendar. Therefore we cannot ignore or eschew the word ‘British calendar’ while construing “month” under the Act. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the period of six months cannot be calculated on 30 days in a month basis. Therefore, both the modes of calculation suggested by Mr.Ahmadi do not deserve acceptance and are rejected accordingly.

The next question which calls for our answer is the date from which six months’ period would commence. In case of ambiguity with reference to the date of commencement, Section 9 of the General Clauses Act can be pressed into service and the same reads as follows:

“9. Commencement and termination of time.-(1) In any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word “from”, and, for the purpose of including the last in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word “to”.
From the judgment of this Court in the case of Sivakaumar(supra) and as quoted in the preceding paragraph of this judgment, it is evident that this Court recorded its agreement to a limited extent that “in cases where there is an ambiguity or suspicion with reference to the date of commencement of period of limitation” “Section 9 of the General Clauses Act can be pressed into service.” We would hasten to add that this Court in Sivakumar (supra) did not give nod to the following proposition enunciated by the Kerala High Court in K.V.Muhammed Kunhi (supra).

“3………….But in the instant case before me, Section 138 proviso (a) is involved which is so clear (as extracted above) that the date of limitation will commence only from the date found in the cheque or the instrument.” In the case of K.V.Muhammed Kunhi (supra) the cheque was dated 17.11.1994 and that was presented on 17.5.1995, and in this background the Court observed as follows:

“5. …. When on the footing of the days covered by the British calendar month the period of limitation in the case on hand is calculated, the cheque ought to have been presented in the Bank for collection on or before 16-5-1995. But in this case, as pointed out above the cheque had been presented for collection only on 17-5-
1995, which is clearly barred by limitation.” In this case, six months’ period expired a day prior to the corresponding month. In the case in hand, no such day falls in the corresponding month and therefore the last day would be last date of the immediate previous month.

Mr. Ahmadi appeals to us that if we take the view that the cheque was presented to the Bank before the expiry of six months, it would be in the teeth of the judgment of this Court in the case of Sivakumar (supra) and therefore the matter shall be required to be referred to a larger Bench. From what we have observed above, we have not taken a view different than what has been held in Sivakumar (supra) and therefore we do not find any necessity to refer the case to a larger Bench.

Proviso (a) to Section 138 of the Act uses the expression “six months from the date on which it is drawn”. Once the word ‘from’ is used for the purpose of commencement of time, in view of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, the day on which the cheque is drawn has to be excluded.

This Court, relying on several English decisions, dealt with the issue of computation of time for the purpose of limitation extensively in Haru Das Gupta v. State of West Bengal, (1972) 1 SCC 639 wherein Paragraph 5 states as follows:

“5. These decisions show that courts have drawn a distinction between a term created within which an act may be done and a time limited for the doing of an act. The rule is well established that where a particular time is given from a certain date within which an act is to be done, the day on that date is to be excluded, (see Goldsmiths Company v. The West Metropolitan Railway Co. (1904 KB 1 at 5). This rule was followed in Cartwright v. Maccormack (1963) 1 All E.R. 11, where the expression “fifteen days from the date of commencement of the policy” in a cover note issued by an insurance company was construed as excluding the first date and the cover note to commence at midnight of that day, and also in Marren v.
Dawson Bentley and Co. Ltd., (1961) 2 QB 135, a case for compensation for injuries received in the course of employment, where for purposes of computing the period of limitation the date of the accident, being the date of the cause of action, was excluded. (See also Stewart v. Chadman [1951] 2 KB 792 and In re North, Ex parte Wasluck [1895] 2 QB 264.) Thus, as a general rule the effect of defining a period from such a day until such a day within which an act is to be done is to exclude the first day and to include the last day. [See Halsbury’s Laws of England (3rd ed.) Vol.37, pp.92 and 95.] There is no reason why the aforesaid rule of construction followed consistently and for so long should not also be applied here.” (underlining ours) This decision was quoted with approval in Saketh India Ltd. v. India Securities Ltd., (1999) 3 SCC 1 in the following words:

“7. The aforesaid principle of excluding the day from which the period is to be reckoned is incorporated in Section 12(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act, 1963. Section 12(1) specifically provides that in computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application, the day from which such period is to be reckoned, shall be excluded. Similar provision is made in sub-section (2) for appeal, revision or review. The same principle is also incorporated in Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which, inter alia, provides that in any Central Act made after the commencement of the General Clauses Act, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word “from” and for the purpose of including the last in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word “to”.
8. Hence, there is no reason for not adopting the rule enunciated in the aforesaid case which is consistently followed and which is adopted in the General Clauses Act and the Limitation Act……………” The correctness of this judgment came up for consideration before a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Econ Antri Ltd. vs. Rom Industries Ltd. & Anr., AIR 2013 SC 3283 which approved the reasoning of this Court given in Saketh (supra) and Haru Das Gupta (supra) and held as under:

“16. We have extensively referred to Saketh. The reasoning of this Court in Saketh based on the above English decisions and decision of this Court in Haru Das Gupta which aptly lay down and explain the principle that where a particular time is given from a certain date within which an act has to be done, the day of the date is to be excluded, commends itself to us as against the reasoning of this Court in SIL Import USA where there is no reference to the said decisions.
xxx xxx xxx
22. In view of the above, it is not possible to hold that the word ‘of’ occurring in Section 138(a) and 142(b) of the N.I.Act is to be interpreted differently as against the word ‘from’ occurring in Section 138(a) of the N.I.Act; and that for the purposes of Section 142(b), which prescribes that the complaint is to be filed within 30 days of the date on which the cause of action arises, the starting day on which the cause of action arises should be included for computing the period of 30 days. As held in Ex parte Fallon (1793) 5 Term Rep 283 the words ‘of’, ‘from’ and ‘after’ may, in a given case, mean really the same thing. As stated in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary, Vol. 3 1953 Edition, Note (5), the word ‘of’ is sometimes equivalent of ‘after’.” At this stage, we would also like to refer to Halsbury’s Law of England, Vol. 37, 3rd Edn., Paragraph 143 at Pages 83-84 which provides for calculation of a calendar month:
“143. Calendar month running from arbitrary date. When the period prescribed is a calendar month running from any arbitrary date the period expires with the day in the succeeding month immediately preceding the day corresponding to the date upon which the period starts; save that, if the period starts at the end of a calendar month which contains more days than the next succeeding month, the period expires at the end of the latter month.” Drawing a conclusion from the above mentioned authorities, we are of the opinion that the use of word “from” in Section 138(a) requires exclusion of the first day on which the cheque was drawn and inclusion of the last day within which such act needs to be done. In other words, six months would expire one day prior to the date in the corresponding month and in case no such day falls, the last day of the immediate previous month. Hence, for all purposes, the date on which the cheque was drawn, i.e., 31.12.2005 will be excluded and the period of six months will be reckoned from the next day i.e. from 1.1.2006; meaning thereby that according to the British calendar, the period of six months will expire at the end of the 30th day of June, 2006. Since the cheque was presented on 30.6.2006, we are of the view that it was presented within the period prescribed.
Viewed from any angle, the prosecution is not time barred and therefore, cannot be scuttled at this stage on this ground. As the matter is pending since long, the learned Magistrate in seisin of the trial shall make endeavour to conclude it within six months from the date the appellant next appears in the case. We direct the appellant to appear before the trial Judge on 3rd of March, 2014 and no notice is to be issued to him for his appearance.
In the result, we do not find any merit in the appeal and it is dismissed accordingly.",0
RAJINDER KUMAR,"Specific performance is an equitable relief granted by the courts in specific situations. Plainly speaking, equity means fairness. According to Sir Edward Fry, the Court by a decree of specific performance compels the defaulting party to do that which in conscience he is bound to do, viz., actually and specifically to perform his contract[1]. Conscience means a person’s moral sense of right or wrong[2]. Thus, what is morally wrong cannot be equitably right and necessarily what is morally right will be just and proper. This prelude is the keyhole for us to see through the factual and legal position of a three decade long litigation on a specific performance.

FACTS

3. One Nand Lal (deceased) was the perpetual lessee of the Land and Development Officer (hereinafter referred to as ‘L&DO’) of property bearing Bungalow No. 9, Sunder Nagar, New Delhi measuring 0.179 acres equal to 865 sq. yards equal to 721 sq. metres. His legal heirs are - (1) Banarsi Das; (2) Dhanpat Rai; (3) Din Dayal; and (4) Gaindo Devi (widow of a pre-deceased son Paras Ram) as his legal heirs. Each had a 1/4th share in the suit property. Din Dayal passed away leaving behind, as originally claimed - (5) his widow Sushila Devi; (6) son Mohinder Kumar Gupta; (7) son Surinder Dayal; (8) son Narinder Dayal; and (9) daughter Vijay Laksmi and each of them had 1/24th share each in the suit property.

4. The eight legal heirs of Nand Lal entered into an agreement to sell the aforesaid immovable property on 29/30.07.1980 with Kuldeep Singh- (respondent) for a total sum of Rs.14,00,000/- out of which Kuldeep Singh paid Rs.1,40,000/- as earnest money and possession of one garage in the suit property was handed over to him. The balance amount of Rs.12,60,000/- was to be paid by the respondent on the execution and registration of the sale deed and delivery of possession.

5. One Rajinder Kumar (Petitioner in SLP (C) No. 19215/2011) claims that he is son of the late Din Dayal and at the time of agreement to sell, he was a minor. He filed a suit through his maternal grandfather (Suit No. 1428 of 1981) and sought a declaration that the agreement for sale was illegal as he was not a party to it. The suit was dismissed for default on 22.05.1984. After more than 17 years, it was eventually restored on 17.01.2002.

6. The respondent-Kuldeep Singh filed a suit (Suit No. 280/1982) on 10.01.1982 for specific performance of the agreement against the eight legal heirs, impleading also Rajinder Kumar in the said suit as defendant no. 9, on the original side of High Court of Delhi. The suit was decreed ex parte on 30.04.1984. Appeal (RFA (OS) NO. 14/1985) against the above Judgment dated 30.04.1984 was dismissed vide order dated 22.03.1985 as time barred. An application under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 filed thereafter for setting aside the decree was also dismissed on 15.07.1985. Thus, the decree has attained finality.

7. Kuldeep Singh filed Execution Petition (No. 164/1990) on 07.11.1990. Mohinder Kumar Gupta (petitioner in SLP No. 28302 of 2010), one of the judgment debtors, filed Application No. 110/1991 objecting to the execution of the decree. Another application EA NO. 111/1991 was filed by minor Rajinder Kumar under Order XXI Rule 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Single Judge of the Delhi High Court vide Judgment dated 01.02.2002 dismissed both petitions holding that the decree dated 30.04.1984 is executable. Aggrieved, Mohinder Kumar Gupta filed FAO (OS) No. 66/2002 against the aforesaid judgment dated 01.02.2002 and Rajinder Kumar filed EFA (OS) No. 4/2002 before the Division Bench of the High Court.

8. Meanwhile, on 24.04.1999, some of the appellants filed an application under Section 28 of Specific Relief Act,1963 (IA No. 4274/1999 in Suit No. 280/1982) for rescission of the agreement. That was dismissed by the Single Judge, High Court of Delhi vide Order dated 23.02.2000. FAO (OS) 110/2000 before the Division Bench of the High Court arises against the order dated 23.02.2000.

9. The Division Bench vide Judgment dated 19.02.2010 dismissed FAO (OS) No. 110 of 2000, FAO (OS) NO. 66 of 2002 but allowed EFA (OS) No. 4/2002 filed by the then minor Rajinder Kumar, holding that the execution against him cannot be pursued as there is no decree against him.

10. The appellants then filed review petitions No. 210/2010 & 328/2010 against Judgment dated 19.02.2010 in FAO (OS) No. 110/2000. The High Court dismissed the Review Petition No. 210/2010 in FAO (OS) No. 110/2000 and Review Petition No. 328 of 2010 in FAO (OS) No. 66 of 2002 on 25.04.2011. Thus, they are before this Court in these appeals.

11. It is the main contention of the appellants that the decree dated 30.04.1984 is inexecutable since it is vague and contingent. It is also contended that the High Court of Delhi failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction while deciding the application for rescinding the contract. There are other ancillary contentions as well.

12. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the parties, we feel that mainly two issues arise for consideration:

      A.    Is the decree executable?
      B.    Was the application for rescission properly decided?

13. The agreement for sale was executed by the appellants (Defendants 1 to

8) on 30.07.1980. They received part of the consideration, viz., Rs. 1,40,000/- as earnest money. Possession of part of the agreement schedule property, a garage was parted with. The balance Rs.12,60,000/- was to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed. That deed could have been executed only after obtaining permission from the L&DO, Delhi. As per the agreement, it was for the vendors to obtain that permission from the L&DO on paying the unearned increase. There were certain other obligations as well. That the vendors actually intended to sell the property is clear from the fact that they had approached the L&DO and the L&DO gave permission on 12.11.1981, subject to payment of an amount of Rs.7,17,330/-. The unearned increase came to be such a large amount only because of the delay caused by the purchaser in getting his power of attorney, it is alleged. The amount was not deposited by the vendors even during the time extended by the L&DO.

14. It was in the meanwhile, Rajinder Kumar (petitioner in SLP (Civil) No. 19215 of 2011) claiming to be the minor son of Din Dayal, filed a suit on 15.12.1981 attacking the agreement, claiming his 1/24th share and for other reliefs. Rajinder Kumar aged 7 years at the time of the agreement, filed the suit through his maternal grandfather even though his mother and natural guardian who is signatory to the agreement to sale, was very much alive and available. Smelling a rat, the purchaser- Kuldeep Singh on 10.01.1982 filed OS No. 1428 of 1981 on the original side of the High Court for specific performance. At that time, the suit filed by Rajinder Kumar was pending for plaintiff’s evidence. Rajinder Kumar was arrayed as Defendant No. 9 in the suit for specific performance. For some reason or other, the defendants did not file written statement despite several chances. Hence, the suit was decreed as prayed for on 30.04.1984.

Sd/ Dy. Registrar”

16. Appeal was dismissed as time barred. A few months thereafter an Application under Order IX Rule 13 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was filed for setting aside the ex parte decree. That too was dismissed. It appears the vendors lost all hope and left things as they were at that stage. It is seen from the pleadings that attempts were also made for an out of court settlement, but in vain.

17. We do not think that the vendors would be justified in setting up any defence on executability of the decree both on law and facts of the case. At the risk of redundancy, on referring to the facts, it can be seen that the vendors had in fact wanted to fructify the agreement for sale. Having received the advance amount of Rs.1,40,000/-, they had parted possession of a part of the property, viz., garage. They had jointly made an application to the L&DO in terms of the agreement, for permission to transfer the property. The L&DO did grant the permission but on condition of deposit of an amount of Rs.7,17,330/- towards the unearned increase, which is more than 50% of the sale consideration. The value of the property had shot up by that time. It is pertinent to note that as per the original agreement, the unearned increase was to be paid by the vendors. On account of the escalation, it appears, their hearts started burning and they were extremely reluctant to part with the property. Their attempts thereafter have always been, one way or the other, to delay, if not deny, their obligation for conveyance of the property.

18. The main contention of the vendors is that that there is no decree in terms of Section 2 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 because there is no formal expression of adjudication and the court has not conclusively determined the rights of the parties. But it has to be seen that the vendors did not contest the suit. They had not even filed a written statement. In that context only, the suit was decreed as prayed for. In the Judgment dated 30.04.1984, the Court has referred to the averments in the plaint. The opening and concluding sentences of the Judgment read as follows:

“Plaintiff, S. Kuldeep Singh has filed the present suit against Shri Banarsi Dass and 8 others for specific performance of an agreement to sell dated 29/30th July 1980. The agreement relates to plot No.9, Block No.171 in the layout plan of the New Capital of Delhi, now known as Bungalow No.9, Sunder Nagar, New Delhi. … xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx However, since the Defendants have failed to file written statement, as directed in my order dated 15th February, 1984, I proceed to pronounce the judgment under the provisions of order 8 rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and decree the suit of the plaintiff as prayed for with costs against Defendants 1 to 8 only as there is no relief prayed against Defendant No.9.”

19. Having referred to the entire contentions of the plaintiff, the Judgment was pronounced under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 since there was no written statement. The Court has taken the position that the defendants had failed to file written statement. Therefore, the Court, in the facts of the case, opted to pronounce the Judgment, under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and draw the decree accordingly.

20. No doubt, the decree passed under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 is an ex parte decree. But merely because it is an ex parte decree, the same does not cease to have the force of the decree. It is a valid decree for all purposes.

21. It is also worthwhile to note that the Judgment was pronounced under the pre-amended Rule 10 under Order VIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and there was more discretion with the Court regarding pronouncement of the Judgment in the absence of written statement. Still further, it is to be noted that Rule 10 speaks about the requirement of written statement indicating thereby that there are cases where written statement was required to be filed. Written statement is the defense of the defendants. They chose not to file it. Despite the absence of such defense, the court still applied its mind and after referring to the pleadings, pronounced a Judgment allowing the suit for specific performance. Though the Judgment says that the suit is decreed as prayed for and though all the prayers have been incorporated in the decree, it is to be noted that the suit is one for specific performance of the agreement. The suit that has been decreed is the suit for specific performance of the agreement. Once the decree for specific performance attained finality, they cannot thereafter turn round and make weak and lame contentions regarding the executability of the decree.

22. If the suit for specific performance is not decreed as prayed for, then alone the question of any reference to the alternative relief would arise. Therefore, there is no question of any ambiguity. As held by this Court in Topanmal Chhotamal v. Kundomal Gangaram and Others[3] and consistently followed thereafter, even if there is any ambiguity, it is for the executing court to construe the decree if necessary after referring to the Judgment. If sufficient guidance is not available even from the Judgment, the Court is even free to refer to the pleadings so as to construe the true import of the decree. No doubt, the court cannot go behind the decree or beyond the decree. But while executing a decree for specific performance, the Court, in case of any ambiguity, has necessarily to construe the decree so as to give effect to the intention of the parties. Thus, there is no question of any alternate relief regarding the damages etc. in the present case since the suit for the specific performance for the conveyance of the property has been decreed.

23. There is no case that the court does not have jurisdiction to pass the decree. Nor is there any case that the decree is a nullity on account of any jurisdictional error. Hence, the decree is executable for all intents and purposes but limited to the shares of the vendors. The claim of Rajinder Kumar would depend on the outcome of the pending suit.

24. Now we shall deal with the issue regarding the approach of the High Court in dealing with the application for rescission. Apparently, the purchaser-Kuldeep Singh was also not quite serious in pursuing the cause. Though the decree is dated 30.04.1984, the execution petition was filed only after six and a half years, on 07.11.1990. No doubt, it was within the time prescribed by the law of limitation. But the efflux of time assumes importance and seriousness in the background of the escalation of price in real estate.

25. It is very strange that no serious steps have been taken by the executing court for almost a decade. While so, only on 24.04.1999, respondents 3 to 7 and 13 filed Application – IA No. 4274 of 1999 in the suit for rescinding the agreement for sale. The main ground taken in the Application for rescission of the agreement was that the plaintiff/purchaser failed to deposit the balance consideration of Rs.12,60,000/-. It was also contended that between the date of decree in 1984 and the date of filing the Application for rescission, even the notified rates in land value shot up from Rs.2,000/- per square yard to Rs.13,860/- per square meter and the unearned increase would be around Rs.50,00,000/- and, thus, it would be highly unjust, unconscionable and inequitable to compel the vendors to make the payment of the unearned increase. It was also averred that the vendors were prepared to pay a reasonable compensation to the purchaser. The purchaser-Kuldeep Singh in response to the Application for rescission, stated that the court had not fixed any time for deposit of the balance amount, the balance amount was payable only on the execution and registration of the conveyance deed. He also contended that execution was possible only on permission from the L&DO on payment of unearned increase by the vendors and for which the vendors are at fault in not having taken any serious steps in completing their obligations under the decree; and that the purchaser had always been ready and willing to perform his part of the agreement.

26. By Order dated 23.02.2000, the learned Single Judge dismissed the applications holding that the purchaser was not at fault either in having done something or in not having done something which stood in the way of the execution of the decree. On the contrary, it was the vendors who did not perform their duties in the sequence of events prior to and leading to the registration of the sale deed. In short, it was held that the vendors having not performed their obligations under the agreement, they could not approach the court for rescinding the agreement on the ground that the purchaser had not deposited the balance amount.

27. It is extremely important and crucially relevant to note that the court did not advert to one of the main contentions regarding the escalation in land value by which the vendors had to incur the liability of around four times the balance consideration by way of payment of unearned increase to the L&DO so as to complete their obligation. It is pertinent also to note that the said unconscionable liability for the vendors arose only on account of the delayed execution of the decree.

28. It is significant to note that during the pendency of the appeals, the purchaser sought permission of the court to deposit the balance consideration and, on 06.01.2010, the same was granted. He, accordingly, deposited some amounts towards the liability of unearned income also.

29. It appears from the Order dated 06.01.2010 in FAO (OS) No. 66 of 2002 that only oral submissions were made for the deposit of balance consideration, by the respondent-Kuldeep Singh. For the purpose of ready reference, we may extract the Order as such: “Learned counsel for Respondent No.1 (Kuldeep Singh) says that the balance consideration in terms of the contract entered into between the parties will be deposited by his client on or before 11th January, 2010. Learned counsel for Respondent No.1 also says that the unearned increase that is required to be calculated by the L and DO has not yet been so calculated but his client is prepared to deposit an amount of Rs. 10 lakhs on account in this regard. This amount will be deposited with the Registrar General of this Court on or before 11th January, 2010.

List for directions on 12th January, 2010.

Arguments have been heard and concluded and judgment is reserved. The matter is listed on 12th January, 2010 only for compliance with regard to the deposit.”

30. We have referred to above development to keep in mind one significant and important aspect of the matter that the vendors did not get an opportunity to make their response to the oral submission made by the purchaser with regard to deposit of the balance consideration, after passage of around 26 years after the decree.

31. Having regard to the facts and circumstances which we have discussed above, we are afraid the High Court has not made an attempt to balance equity. As in the case of a decree for specific performance where equity weighs with the court so is the situation in considering an application under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 for rescinding the contract. Under Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, a vendor is free to apply to the Court which made decree to have the contract rescinded in case the purchaser has not paid the purchase money or other sum which the Court has ordered him to pay within the period allowed by the decree or such other period as the court may allow. On such an application, the Court may, by order, rescind the contract “as the justice of the case may require”. It is now settled law that a suit for specific performance does not come to an end on passing of a decree and the Court which passed the decree retains control over the decree even after the decree has been passed and the decree is sometimes described as the preliminary decree.

32. In Hungerford Investment Trust Limited (In Voluntary Liquidation) v. Haridas Mundhra and Others[4], it has been held that: “22. It is settled by a long course of decisions of the Indian High Courts that the Court which passes a decree for specific performance retains control over the decree even after the decree has been passed. In Mahommadalli Sahib v. Abdul Khadir Saheb (1930) MLJ Vol. 59, p.351 it was held that the Court which passes a decree for specific performance has the power to extend the time fixed in the decree for the reason that Court retains control over the decree, that the contract between the parties is not extinguished by the passing of a decree for specific performance and that the contract subsists notwithstanding the passing of the decree. …” (Emphasis supplied)

33. The discretionary power vested in court by Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is intended to apply in such circumstances: “The effect of this provision is to empower the court which passed the decree for specific performance to rescind the contract and set aside the decree which it has passed earlier if the successful plaintiff failed to comply with the terms of the decree by making payment of the purchase money or other sums which the court ordered him to pay. …[5]” (Emphasis supplied)

34. The decree for specific performance is a decree in favour of both the plaintiff and the defendant in the suit, as held by this Court in Hungerford Investment Trust Limited case (supra). Hence, the decree can be executed either by the plaintiff or the defendant.

35. The plaintiff or the defendant is also free to approach the court for appropriate clarification/directions in the event of any ambiguity or supervening factors making the execution of the decree inexecutable. To quote Fry (ibid) (please see Pages-546-548): “1170. It may and not unfrequently does happen that after judgment has been given for the specific performance of a contract, some further relief becomes necessary, in consequence of one or other of the parties making default in the performance of something which ought under the judgment to be performed by him or on his part ; as, for instance, where a vendor refuses or in unable to execute a proper conveyance of the property, or a purchaser to pay the purchase-money. The character of the consequential relief appropriate to any particular case will of course vary according to the nature of the subject-matter of the contract and the position which the applicant occupies in the transaction; but in every case the application must, under the present practice, be made only to the Court by which the judgment was pronounced, and the multiplicity of legal proceedings which sometimes occurred before the fusion of the jurisdictions of the Courts of Chancery and Common Law is now practically impossible.

1171. There are two kinds of relief after judgment for specific performance of which either party to the contract may, in a proper case, avail himself.

1172.(i.) He may obtain (on motion in the action) an order appointing a definite time and place for completion of the contract by payment of the unpaid purchase-money and delivery over of the executed conveyance and title-deeds, or a period within which the judgment is to be obeyed, and, if the other party fails to obey the order, may thereupon at once issue a writ of sequestration against the defaulting party’s estate and effects. Furthermore, if the default was in the payment of money, the plaintiff may issue his fi.fa. or elegit: if in some act other than or besides the payment of money, he may move, on notice to the defaulter, for a writ of attachment against him. Indeed, in a case where a person who had agreed to accept a lease would not, though ordered by the Court to do so, execute the lease, it was held that an attachment was the only means to which the Court could resort for enforcing such execution.

1173. (ii.) He may apply to the Court (by motion in the action) for an order rescinding the contract. On an application of this kind, if it appears that the party moved against has positively refused to complete the contract, its immediate rescission may be ordered : otherwise, the order will be for rescission in default of completion within a limited time. And where a deposit has been paid, and there is no condition of the contract determining, expressly or impliedly, what is to be done with it in the event of such a rescission, the Court will decline to order the deposit to be returned to a defaulting purchaser. An order for the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs, and a stay of further proceedings in the action, except such proceedings as may be necessary for recovery of the costs of the action and the costs of the motion, may also be obtained on this application. A vendor plaintiff is not debarred from moving for an order for rescission by the fact that the judgment at the trial contained a declaration of his vendor’s lien, and gave him liberty to apply as to enforcing it.

In some cases the order has expressly excepted from the stay of proceedings any application to the Court to award and assess damages sustained by the plaintiff’s by reason or in consequence of the breach of contract. In Henty v. Schroder (12 Ch.D.666), however, Jessel M.R. declined to make this exception, consider that the plaintiffs could not at the same time obtain an order to have the contract rescinded and claim damages for the breach of it. If this be so, it would seem that in many cases the Court must fail to give the plaintiff the full measure of relief requisite for replacing him in the position in which he stood before the contract,-the repayment, for instance, of expenses incurred by him in showing his title.” (Emphasis supplied)

36. Dealing with a situation where deterioration takes place by the conduct, according to Fry (ibid) (please see Page 654): “1431. If, after the contract and before the purchaser takes, or ought to take, possession, any deterioration take place by the conduct of the vendor or his tenants, he will be accountable for it to the purchaser. “He is not entitled to treat the estate as his own. If he willfully damages or injures it, he is liable to the purchaser ; and more than that, he is liable if he does not take reasonable care of it.” And this liability may be enforced by action, even after a conveyance made in ignorance of the facts.

1432. Where a purchaser had paid his money into Court under an order, and was held entitled to compensation for deterioration, which had taken place while the vendors retained possession, he was allowed the amount out of his purchase-money, with interest at 4 per cent., and the costs of an issue to ascertain the amount of damage.” (Emphasis supplied)

37. In the instant case, converse is the position. If the purchaser is entitled to claim compensation for deterioration, a fortiori it must be held that vendor should also be entitled to compensation for accretion in value of the subject matter of the agreement for specific performance, in case the execution thereof is unduly delayed by the purchaser. Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act provides that the court has to pass an order as the justice of the case may require. Justice is not an abstract proposition. It is a concrete reality. The parties on approaching the court must get the feeling that justice has been done in the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly in specific performance related cases, in terms of equity, equality and fairness.

38. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it is very difficult to balance the equity and balance the rights of both the parties in the background of their conduct. No doubt there was no time fixed in the agreement for payment of the purchase money. That was also contingent on a series of obligations to be performed by the vendor and the duty of the purchaser to pay the purchase money was only thereafter. But if we closely analyze the pleadings and submissions, we can see that the purchaser had made an attempt, though belatedly, for getting the obligations performed even at his expense.

39. The plaintiff purchaser very well knew that the vendors have been delaying the performance of their obligation under the agreement and things were getting complicated. It was open to the plaintiff, in such circumstances, to file an application, rather he ought to have filed an application in court on the original side for appropriate direction with regard to the payment of purchase money and for other procedural formalities. Despite the application filed by the vendor for rescission of the agreement in 1999, for the first time, an oral prayer was made by the purchaser before the court for the deposit of balance of purchase money only in the year 2010. That too was merely an oral submission. Consequently, the defendants never had an opportunity to respond to the same or contest the proposition. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that in the peculiar factual background of this case, the plaintiff purchaser was also at fault in not taking prompt steps.

40. In this context, one more reference to Hungerford Investment Trust Limited (supra) would be relevant:

“25. It was contended on behalf of Mundhra that he was always ready and willing to pay the purchase money, but since the decree did not specify any time for payment of the money, there was no default on his part. In other words, the contention was that since the decree did not specify a time within which the purchase money should be paid and, since an application for fixing the time was made by the appellant and dismissed by the Court, Mundhra cannot be said to have been in default in not paying the purchase money so that the Appellant might apply for rescission of the decree. If a contract does not specify the time for performance, the Law will imply that the parties intended that the obligation under the contract should be performed within a reasonable time. Section 46 of the Contract Act provides that where, by a contract, a promiser is to perform his promise without application by the promise, and no time for performance is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable time and the question ""what is reasonable time"" is, in each particular case, a question of fact. ...” (Emphasis supplied)

41. Analyzing the conduct of the vendors-defendants also, one can see that they are equally at fault. In the contract, no time was fixed for payment and, therefore, the purchaser was obliged to pay the purchase money within a reasonable time. Owing to the laches or lapses on the part of the parties in case there is any insurmountable difficulty, hardship or, on account of subsequent development, any inequitable situation had arisen, either party was free to approach the court for appropriate direction. Though the suit was decreed in the year 1984 and execution petition filed in 1990, the application for rescission was filed only in the year 1999.

42. In Nirmala Anand v. Advent Corporation (P) Ltd. and Others[6], it has been held by this Court:

“6. It is true that grant of decree of specific performance lies in the discretion of the court and it is also well settled that it is not always necessary to grant specific performance simply for the reason that it is legal to do so. It is further well settled that the court in its discretion can impose any reasonable condition including payment of an additional amount by one party to the other while granting or refusing decree of specific performance. Whether the purchaser shall be directed to pay an additional amount to the seller or converse would depend upon the facts and circumstances of a case. Ordinarily, the plaintiff is not to be denied the relief of specific performance only on account of the phenomenal increase of price during the pendency of litigation. That may be, in a given case, one of the considerations besides many others to be taken into consideration for refusing the decree of specific performance. As a general rule, it cannot be held that ordinarily the plaintiff cannot be allowed to have, for her alone, the entire benefit of phenomenal increase of the value of the property during the pendency of the litigation. While balancing the equities, one of the consideration to be kept in view is as to who is the defaulting party. It is also to be borne in mind whether a party is trying to take undue advantage over the other as also the hardship that may be caused to the defendant by directing the specific performance. There may be other circumstances on which parties may not have any control. The totality of the circumstances is required to be seen.” (Emphasis supplied) In the above case, this Court balanced the equity by directing payment of Rs.6,25,000/- in the place of Rs.25,000/-.

43. In Satya Jain (Dead) Through Lrs. and Others v. Anis Ahmed Rushdie (Dead) Through Lrs. and Others[7], it has been held that: “38. The ultimate question that has now to be considered is: whether the plaintiff should be held to be entitled to a decree for specific performance of the agreement of 22-12-1970?

39. The long efflux of time (over 40 years) that has occurred and the galloping value of real estate in the meantime are the twin inhibiting factors in this regard. The same, however, have to be balanced with the fact that the plaintiffs are in no way responsible for the delay that has occurred and their keen participation in the proceedings till date show the live interest on the part of the plaintiffs to have the agreement enforced in law.

40. The discretion to direct specific performance of an agreement and that too after elapse of a long period of time, undoubtedly, has to be exercised on sound, reasonable, rational and acceptable principles. The parameters for the exercise of discretion vested by Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 cannot be entrapped within any precise expression of language and the contours thereof will always depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The ultimate guiding test would be the principles of fairness and reasonableness as may be dictated by the peculiar facts of any given case, which features the experienced judicial mind can perceive without any real difficulty. It must however be emphasized that efflux of time and escalation of price of property, by itself, cannot be a valid ground to deny the relief of specific performance. Such a view has been consistently adopted by this Court. By way of illustration opinions rendered in P.S. Ranakrishna Reddy v. M.K. Bhagyalakshmi[8]: and more recently in Narinderjit Singh v. North Star Estate Promoters Ltd.[9] may be usefully recapitulated.

41. The twin inhibiting factors identified above if are to be read as a bar to the grant of a decree of specific performance would amount to penalizing the plaintiffs for no fault on their part; to deny them the real fruits of a protracted litigation wherein the issues arising are being answered in their favour. From another perspective it may also indicate the inadequacies of the law to deal with the long delays that, at times, occur while rendering the final verdict in a given case. The aforesaid two features, at best, may justify award of additional compensation to the vendor by grant of a price higher than what had been stipulated in the agreement which price, in a given case, may even be the market price as on date of the order of the final Court.” (Emphasis supplied)

44. The circle rate of the residential property based on which the unearned increase is calculated by the L&DO, would show a sharp increase during the period. Sunder Nagar comes under Category ‘A’ colonies. Under the Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments) Rules, 2007, the notified circle rate for Category ‘A’ colonies from July 2007 was Rs.43,000/- per square meter and from February 8, 2011, it was Rs.86,000/- per square meter. From November 16, 2011, it was Rs.2,15,000/- per square meter and from January 5, 2012, it is Rs.6,45,000/- per square meter.

45. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the trial court should have passed an equitable order while considering the application for rescission. Having regard to the fact that the decree was passed in 1984, we feel that it would be unjust and unfair to relegate the parties to the trial court at this distance of time. For doing complete justice to the parties, we are of the view that it is a case where the purchaser should be directed to pay the land value to the vendors as per the circle rate notified for the residential property in Category ‘A’ colonies prevailing during November 16, 2011 to January 5, 2012, at the rate of Rs.2,15,000/- per square meter. The purchaser shall also be liable to meet the liability arising by way of unearned increase to be paid to the Land and Development Office. He is free to withdraw the amounts deposited by him in the court as per order dated 06.01.2010. It is also ordered that in case the plaintiff does not deposit the amount to be paid to the vendors within three months from today, the vendors shall deposit in court within two months thereafter the amount calculated as per the circle rate referred to above by way of compensation to be paid to the purchaser, and in which event, they shall stand discharged of their obligations under the contract and the decree. In the event of the purchaser depositing the amount as above, the execution proceedings shall be finalized within another one month. The Court in seisin of the Suit OS No. 1428 of 1981 shall dispose of the same within three months from today.

46. The Appeal filed by Rajinder Kumar [arising out of SLP (C) No. 19215/2011] is dismissed and the other Appeals are partly allowed as above. There is no order as to costs.

",1
Maya Devi,"The appellant herein filed an Objection Petition under Order 21 Rule 58 CPC, when the decree obtained by the respondent in Civil Suit No.407 of 2007 was sought to be executed. Suit was filed for the recovery of an amount of Rs.3,40,000/- with interest, which was sought to be realized, on the property covered by an agreement for sale dated 3.11.2003 between the judgment debtor and decree holder. The appellant claimed that she became the absolute owner of the suit property by virtue of a registered General Power of Attorney dated 12.5.2006 and that she has been in actual physical possession of the suit property. The Petition was contested by the decree holder/respondent stating that the applicant/objector had no legal right, title or interest and that the execution of the General Power of Attorney and its registration would not confer any ownership right in favour of the appellant/objector. Reliance was also placed on the judgment of this Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited Through Director v. State of Haryana & Anr. (2009) 7 SCC 363. The Executing Court vide its order dated 23.7.2010 dismissed the Objection Petition filed by the appellant. Aggrieved by the same, the appellant preferred Execution First Appeal No.23 of 2010 before the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi. The High Court also placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra) and dismissed the appeal holding that the documents relied upon by the appellant would not confer ownership or possession over the property in her favour. The High Court also vide its order dated 24.1.2011 upheld the order of the Executing Court. Aggrieved by the same, this appeal has been preferred by the appellant.

3. Shri Rajesh Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the ratio laid down by this Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra) was wrongly applied by the Executing Court as well as the High Court. Learned counsel submitted that in the final judgment which is reported in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (2) Through Director v. State of Haryana & Anr. (2012) 1 SCC 656, this Court has clarified the position that the judgment would not affect the validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions and that the judgment would operate only prospectively. Learned counsel also submitted that the alleged agreement executed between the respondent and one Prem Chand Verma on 3.11.2003 was a collusive one, subsequently created, to get over the registered Power of Attorney executed on 3.6.1982 between the appellant and wife of Prem Chand Verma, viz. Nirmal Verma. Learned counsel also pointed out that Civil Suit No.407 of 2007 was preferred by the respondent herein against Prem Chand Verma based on the deed of agreement dated 3.11.2003 created for the said purpose. Referring to the above-mentioned judgment, learned counsel further pointed out that Prem Chand Verma did not contest the Suit and he was declared ex-parte and a decree was passed in favour of the respondent. Learned counsel pointed out that the decree was obtained by collusion and practicing fraud on the Court and the Executing Court has committed an error in rejecting the Objection filed by the appellant herein, so also by the High Court by not appreciating the facts in the correct perspective.

4. Shri K. Krishna Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that both the Executing Court and High Court have correctly applied the principles laid down in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra). Learned counsel pointed out that any process which interferes with regular transfers under deeds of conveyance properly stamped, registered and recorded in the registers of the Registration Department, is to be discouraged and deprecated and the Executing Court has rightly declined to give its seal of approval to General Power of Attorney, Agreement for Sale, etc. dated 12.5.2006.

5. I am of the view that the Executing Court as well as High Court have committed a grave error in not properly appreciating the objections filed by the Appellant. We are in this case concerned with the question whether we must give credibility to the registered General Power of Attorney executed on 12.5.2006 between Nirmal Verma and the appellant or on the alleged Agreement for Sale executed on 3.11.2003 between the respondent and Prem Chand Verma, husband of Nirmal Verma. Further, we have to examine the manner in which Civil Suit No.407 of 2007 was decreed without contest by Prem Chand Verma, husband of Nirmal Verma.

6. The registered Power of Attorney was executed by none other than the wife of Prem Chand Verma and the appellant herein on 12.5.2006 in respect of the property in question for a sale consideration of Rs.70,000/-, which was received by Nirmal Verma in cash in advance and she acknowledged the same before the Sub-Registrar, Delhi. On the same day, Nirmal Verma, wife of Prem Chand Verma. handed over physical vacant possession of the land and building situated thereon and from 12th May, 2006 onwards, the appellant is in possession of the above- mentioned property.

7. We are, in this case, therefore, concerned with the legal validity of a General Power of Attorney executed by none other than the wife of Prem Chand Verma against whom a decree has been obtained by the respondent without any proper contest and the court proceeded against him ex-parte. These facts speak for itself. Evidently, the collusive decree was obtained by the respondent to get over the registered Power of Attorney executed in favour of the appellant and, it is in this perspective, we have to understand and apply the ratio laid down by this Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (2) (supra).

8. Paragraph 27 of the judgment of this Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (2) (supra) reads as follows :

“27. We make it clear that our observations are not intended to in any way affect the validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions. For example, a person may give a power of attorney to his spouse, son, daughter, brother, sister or a relative to manage his affairs or to execute a deed of conveyance. A person may enter into a development agreement with a land developer or builder for developing the land either by forming plots or by constructing apartment buildings and in that behalf execute an agreement of sale and grant a power of attorney empowering the developer to execute agreements of sale or conveyances in regard to individual plots of land or undivided shares in the land relating to apartments in favour of prospective purchasers. In several States, the execution of such development agreements and powers of attorney are already regulated by law and subjected to specific stamp duty. Our observations regarding “SA/GPA/will transactions” are not intended to apply to such bona fide/genuine transactions.”
9. In the above judgment, it has been stated that the observations made by the Court are not intended to in any way affect the validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions. I am of the view that the Power of Attorney executed on 12.5.2006 in favour of the Appellant by the wife of Prem Chand Verma is a genuine transaction executed years before the judgment of this Court. Facts will clearly indicate that the Agreement for Sale dated 3.11.2003 was created by none other than the husband of Nirmal Verma, who had executed the General Power of Attorney and possession was handed over to the Appellant. That being the fact situation, in my view, the Objection filed by the Appellant under Order 21 Rule 58 in execution has to be allowed. I, therefore, hold that the Executing Court can execute the decree in Civil Suit No.407 of 2007, but without proceeding against the property referred to in registered Power of Attorney dated 12.5.2006.

10. The appeal is allowed, as above, and the impugned orders are set aside. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.

1     I have perused  the  judgment  of  my  learned  and  esteemed  Brother
Radhakrishnan, and I entirely and respectfully agree with his conclusion that the appeal deserves to be allowed. My learned Brother has succinctly analysed the sterling judgment in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited vs State of Haryana (2009) 7 SCC 363, which has been rendered by a Three- Judge Bench of this Court. I completely concur with the view that since General Power of Attorney (GPA) in favour of the Appellant was executed and registered on 12.05.2006, it could not be impacted or affected by the Suraj Lamp dicta. Furthermore, a reading of the order of the Executing Court as well as of the High Court makes it palpably clear that both the Courts had applied the disqualification and illegality imposed upon GPAs by Suraj Lamp, without keeping in mind that the operation of that judgment was pointedly and poignantly prospective. This question has been dealt with by my esteemed Brother most comprehensively.

2 What strikes us as a perverse, certainly misplaced or inconsistent approach, is that if the Appellant does not possess any title to the property predicated on the GPA executed in her favour by Smt. Nirmal Verma (the wife of the Judgment Debtor Shri Prem Chand Verma), this legal infirmity would inexorably invalidate the title of Smt. Nirmal Verma herself, thereby denuding any titular claim of her husband, the Judgment Debtor, and rendering the property impervious to the subject execution proceedings. Additionally, there is not even a semblance of a right in favour of the Judgment Debtor whose wife was not even impleaded in the suit or in the execution. The impugned judgment notes this contention but fails to address it. The evidence of the Decree Holder has not been filed and therefore the judicial records were summoned from the High Court.

3 The Statement of the Respondent/Decree Holder reads thus:-

“Ex. No. 224/2009 DHW-1: Sh.Lalta Prasad, S/o Sh. Naubat Ram, aged 58 years, R/o 1908, Gali Mata Wali, Chandni Chowk, Delhi-6.
ON S.A.
I, hereby, tender my affidavit in my evidence. The same be read as part and parcel of my statement. My affidavit is Ex. DHW- 1/A(running in 2 pages) which bears my signatures at point A and B on page 1 & 2.
XXXXXX by Sh. Pradeep Chaudhary Adv. for objector.
I have passed 11th standard. The affidavit Ex. DHW-1/A was prepared in the office of my counsel. My counsel has explained me contents of the same to me before I signed the same. Whatever I stated to my counsel was incorporated in Ex. DHW-1/A. The Agreement with Prem Chand Verma was entered on 11.11.2003. I had seen original documents of the property at that time in possession of Prem Chand Verma. He also gave me some copies of the same.
Remaining cross-examination of the witness is deferred till 12.00 P.M.
RO&AC BRIJESH KUMAR GARG ADJ CENTRAL-18 DELHI/ 29.01.10 DHW-1: Sh.Lalta Prasad, recalled for his further cross-examination at 12.50 P.M.
ON S.A.
XXXXXX by Sh. Pradeep Chaudhary Adv. for objector.
I have no knowledge that Smt. Maya Devi had purchased the suit property from Smt. Nirmal Verma. The documents filed by the objectors are forged and fabricated documents. I have no knowledge that Smt. Nirmal Verma purchased the suit property from one Sh. Rajender Kumar.
Sh. Prem Chand Verma was my friend for the last about 30 years. It is correct that Sh. Prem Chand Verma had already expired on 7.10.2008. It is wrong to suggest that Sh. Rajender Kumar was the owner of the property and he sold the property to Nirmal Verma from whom Smt. Maya Devi purchased the suit property. It is wrong to suggest that Sh. Prem Chand Verma was never the owner of the suit property. It is wrong to suggest that I have filed a false affidavit and I am deposing falsely in the court today.
RO&AC BRIJESH KUMAR GARG ADJ CENTRAL-18 DELHI/ 29.01.10” It discloses that the Decree Holder has failed altogether to disprove the title of the Appellant, and he has maintained that the Defendant/Judgment Debtor was the owner, which is admittedly not the actual legal position. If the Decree Holder has been defrauded by the Defendant/Judgment Debtor, largely because of the former’s careless disregard to conduct a title- search, he must face the legal consequences; they cannot be transferred/imposed upon a third party to its detriment. In the wake of the Decree Holder/Plaintiff denying the title of Smt. Nirmal Verma, the Courts below erred in proceeding against her property.

4 Both the Courts below have preferred the view that the Appellant, who has been in possession from the date of the execution of the registered GPA in her favour, has been introduced into the scene in order to defeat the interests of the Respondent, which is a perverse approach for reasons that shall be presently explained. The documents purportedly in favour of the Respondent/Decree Holder are unregistered and the alleged payment made by him to Shri Prem Chand Verma is in cash. Therefore, there is no justification for favouring the view that the alleged transaction between Shri Prem Chand Verma and the Respondent/Decree Holder was genuinely prior in time to the execution of the registered Power of Attorney in favour of the Appellant Smt. Maya Devi by Smt. Nirmal Verma, and the former simultaneously and contemporaneously was put into possession of the property by the latter.

5 There can be no gainsaying that when the probative value of documents is to be assessed, specially those dealing with the creation of any interest in property or its transfer, of a value exceeding Rs.100/-, obviously documents which have been duly registered regardless of whether or not that was legally mandatory, would score over others. A perusal of the judgment shows that whether the sum of Rs.1,70,000/- allegedly paid by the Plaintiff in Suit No.407 of 2007, namely, Shri Lalta Prasad to Shri Prem Chand Verma was in cash or through a traceable Bank transaction or through a registered acknowledgment has not been cogitated upon. Proof of payment by the Plaintiff to the Defendant/husband of the previous owner of the property has not been adjudicated upon. It is not controverted that the Appellant Smt. Maya Devi has been in possession of the property in question from May, 2006. A reading of the judgment by which the Suit was decreed for a sum of Rs.3,40,000/- does not shed any light on the circumstances which made the Plaintiff wait to initiate legal action till after the property was sold and its possession delivered to the Appellant. I, therefore, disbelieve the genuineness of the so-called “Deed of Agreement for Earnest Money” allegedly executed almost three years earlier on 03.11.2003. And, I would rather discount the veracity of the document dated 3.11.2003, then looking upon the Power of Attorney and other documents executed in favour of the Appellant Smt. Maya Devi by Smt. Nirmal Verma as mala fide. What is important is that it is not disputed that the title and possession of the property which has been brought within the sweep of the execution proceedings, was never held in any capacity by the Defendant/Shri Prem Chand Verma, but by his wife, Smt. Nirmal Verma. To give even a semblance of a case to the Plaintiff Lalta Prasad, the Deed of Agreement for Earnest Money should have been between the Plaintiff/Decree Holder/Respondent and Smt. Nirmal Verma.

6 The Trial Court had framed the following issues in Suit No.407/2007, from which subject of proceedings emanates:

“(1) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the suit amount? If so to what sum? OPP (2) Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the interest? If so at what rate and for which period? OPP (3) Relief.” The Trial Court having accepted the payment of Rs.1,70,000/- without insisting on any proof, did not go into the question whether a covenant stipulating that double the amount of earnest money would be payable in the event the contract was not performed, is legal in terms of the Indian Contract Act. The imposition and the recovery of penalty on breach of a contract is legally impermissible under the Indian Contract Act. As regards liquidated damages, the Court would have to scrutinize the pleadings as well as evidence in proof thereof, in order to determine that they are not in the nature of a penalty, but rather as a fair pre-estimate of what the damages are likely to arise in case of breach of the contract.
No evidence whatsoever has been led by the Plaintiff to prove that the claim for twice the amount of earnest money was a fair measure or pre- estimate of damages.

7 The pronouncements of the Constitution Bench in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta & Sons Ltd. vs Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. AIR 1962 SC 1314, and later in Fateh Chand vs Balkishan Dass AIR 1963 SC 1405, hold the field, making it unnecessary to refer to any other precedent for an enunciation of the law, except to appreciate the manner in which the opinion of the Constitution Benches have been applied to the factual matrix in later cases. With the number and volume of precedents increasing exponentially each year, reference to all decisions make arguments excruciatingly lengthy and judgments avoidably prolix. The first important judgment of this Court on the question of Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act is that of the Constitution Bench in Chunilal V. Mehta. The two significant issues which arose were firstly, as to what would constitute a substantial question of law requiring the grant by the High Court of a Certificate to appeal to this Court, and secondly, the quantum of damages that can be awarded in that case owing to the breach of the subject contract. It is the second question which is relevant for the present purposes. The admitted position was that the contract had been wrongfully breached by the Defendant. A clause in the compact between the parties stipulated that in these circumstances, the Plaintiff would be entitled to receive from the Defendant “as compensation or liquidated damages for the loss of such appointment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the monthly salary of not less than Rs.6000/- which the Firm would have been entitled to receive from the Company, for and during the whole of the then unexpired portion of the said period of 21 years if the said Agency of the Firm had not been determined.” The Plaintiff had initially claimed a sum of Rs.50 Lakhs which was subsequently reduced by way of amendment of the plaint to Rs.28,26,804/-. The Constitution Bench opined that “when parties name a sum of money to be paid as liquidated damages they must be deemed to exclude the right to claim an unascertained sum of money as damages. …. Again the right to claim liquidated damages is enforceable under S. 74 of the Contract Act and where such a right is found to exist no question of ascertaining damages really arises. Where the parties have deliberately specified the amount of liquidated damages there can be no presumption that they, at the same time, intended to allow the party who has suffered by the breach to give a go-by to the sum specified and claim instead a sum of money which was not ascertained or ascertainable at the date of the breach”. This precedent prescribes that if a liquidated sum has been mentioned in a contract to be payable on its breach, then if damages have actually been suffered, the said liquidated amount would be the maximum and upper limit of damages awardable by the Trial Court.

8 The judgment of the Constitution Bench one year later, in Fateh Chand concerns award of damages of the ‘liquidated’ sum even though actual damages may have been less. In that respect it is the converse of the factual matrix that existed before the earlier Constitution Bench in Chunilal V. Mehta. J.C. Shah, J (who authored Fateh Chand) along with Chief Justice B.P. Sinha were members of both Constitution Benches. Whilst the aspect of the liquidated damages being in the nature of a penalty or in terrorem did not arise in Chunilal V. Mehta, It did so in Fateh Chand where the complaint was that the Plaintiff, namely, Fateh Chand had agreed to sell an immovable property for Rs.1,12,500/- of which Rs.1000/- had been received/paid as earnest money. The Agreement envisaged payment of a further sum of Rs.24,000/- and it stipulated that if the vendee failed to get the Sale Deed registered thereafter, then the sum received i.e. Rs.25,000/- would stand forfeited. Fateh Chand alleging a breach of the Agreement, sought to forfeit the sum of Rs.25,000/- which was found to be impermissible in law. It was in those circumstances that the Constitution Bench opined as follows:

“10. Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act deals with the measure of damages in two classes of cases (i) where the contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach and (ii) where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. We are in the present case not concerned to decide whether a contract containing a covenant of forfeiture of deposit for due performance of a contract falls within the first class. The measure of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is by S. 74 reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing damages the Court has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation as it deems reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of tile case. Jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court duty to award compensation according to settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken the contract whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with proof of ""actual loss or damage""; it does not justify the award of compensation when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted because compensation for breach of contract can be awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach.
11. Before turning to the question about the compensation which may be awarded to the plaintiff, it is necessary to consider whether S. 74 applies to stipulations for forfeiture of amounts deposited or paid under the contract. It was urged that the section deals in terms with the right to receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation and not the right to forfeit what has already been received by the party aggrieved. There is however no warrant for the assumption made by some of the High Courts in India, that S. 74 applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is seeking to receive some amount on breach of contract and not to cases where upon breach of contract an amount received under the contract is sought to be forfeited. In our judgment the expression ""the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty""
comprehensively applies to every covenant involving a penalty whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money or delivery of property in future, or for forfeiture of right to money or other property already delivered. Duty not to enforce the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed upon Courts by S. 74. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to the terms of contract which expressly provides for forfeiture, the Court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract as liable to forfeiture.” After reading the entire evidence that had been recorded, the Constitution Bench found that the value of the property had not depreciated and, therefore, no damages could be awarded.

9 This is also the manner in which this facet of the law has been enunciated in England, as is evident from the following passage from Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th edn Reissue, 1998) Vol 12(1), para 1065 which reads as follows:-

“1065. Liquidated damages distinguished from penalties.- The parties to a contract may agree at the time of contracting that, in the event of a breach, the party in default shall pay a stipulated sum of money to the other. If this sum is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss which is likely to flow from the breach, then it represents the agreed damages, called ‘liquidated damages’, and it is recoverable without the necessity of proving the actual loss suffered. If, however, the stipulated sum is not a genuine pre- estimate of the loss but is in the nature of a penalty intended to secure performance of the contract, then it is not recoverable, and the plaintiff must prove what damages he can. The operation of the rule against penalties does not depend on the discretion of the court, or on improper conduct, or on circumstances of disadvantage or ascendancy, or on the general character or relationship of the parties. The rule is one of public policy and appears to be sui generis. Its absolute nature inclines the courts to invoke the jurisdiction sparingly. The burden of proving that a payment obligation is penal rests on the party who is sued on the obligation”.
10 The position that obtains in the United States, obviously because of its Common Law origins and adherence, is essentially identical as is evident from these extracted paragraphs of Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 25A (2012):

192- Liquidated damages are a specific sum stipulated to and agreed upon by the parties in advance or when they enter into a contract to be paid to compensate for injuries in the event of a breach or nonperformance of the contract. 196-In examining whether a liquidated-damages provision is enforceable, courts consider whether the damages stemming from a breach are difficult or impossible to estimate or calculate when the contract was entered and whether the amount stipulated bears a reasonable relation to the damages reasonably anticipated. 198-Liquidated damages must bear a reasonable relationship to actual damages, and a liquidated-damages clause is invalid when the stipulated amount is out of all proportion to the actual damages. 200- A penalty is in effect a security for performance, while a provision for liquidated damages is for a sum to be paid in lieu of performance. A term in a contract calling for the imposition of a penalty for the breach of the contract is contrary to public policy and invalid. This position also finds elucidation in the following paragraph from American Restatement (Second) of Contracts 1981:-

“356. LIQUIDATED DAMAGE AND PENALTIES (1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount that is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual loss caused by the breach and the difficulties of proof or loss. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty.” 11 Returning to the facts of the present case, the so called Deed of Agreement for Earnest Money inasmuch as it postulates the payment of twice the sum received ought not to have been decreed as firstly, the contract itself could not have been specifically enforced since the Defendant was devoid of title; and secondly, the Plaintiff had not proved that he had suffered any damages and facially the stipulated sum was in the nature of a penalty.
12 In Phulchand Exports Limited Vs O.O.O. Patriot 2011(10)SCC 300, the Appellant (Seller) entered into a contract with the Respondent (Buyer) relating to the sale/purchase of 1000 MT of Indian polished rice for a total consideration of INR 12,450,000/-. The Seller loaded the rice 16 days late and the Vessel freighted by the Sellers left port (Kandla) 38 days later than the contractually stipulated time of departure. The specified destination, the port of Novorossiysk, Russia, was to be the first port of discharge, and even in this regard there is a finding that the Vessel on which the shipment had been consigned was not sailing directly to the said port, leave aside Novorossiysk being its first port of call. The ship suffered an engine failure which resulted in its requiring salvage operations near Turkey, and the entire cargo on board, including the subject consignment of rice was sold pursuant to Admiralty proceedings to compensate the cost of the rescue of the Vessel. The Insurance Company maintained that the lien of the cargo to compensate the costs of the rescue of the Vessel was not covered in the policy. Arbitration proceedings under the aegis of the International Court of Commercial Arbitration at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation culminated in the passing of an Award which directed the sharing of the price of the rice consignment equally between the parties. In the Award it has been opined that the Buyer had failed to forward the shipping documents and the Insurance Certificate to the Seller and thus was equally blameworthy. The defence of the Seller was that the goods had passed to the Buyer, who had already paid the entire sale price on negotiation of documents by the Seller with the concerned Bank. This Court held that despite the fact that it was a CIF contract, the consignment having been belatedly boarded on the Vessel, which Vessel thereafter sailed later than the time agreed upon by the parties, and which Vessel did not have the contracted destination Novorossiysk as the first port of call, could not have been in conformity with the contract, and hence the goods could not be viewed as having passed to the Buyer thereby shifting to it the liability of the lost shipment. The other question that was raised was whether the stipulation in the contract envisaging the reimbursement of the consideration received by the Seller in the event of non-performance of the contract was in the nature of a penalty. It was in this context that Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act came to be considered. This Court held that the clause requiring the refund of the price of the Rice consignment could not be viewed as a penalty which is not legally recoverable in India and therefore the Award was impervious to jural interference as it was not against the public policy of India even in terms of the interpretation given in ONGC Ltd. vs Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC

705. 13 After recording that the opinion of the two Constitution Benches still hold the field, I have nevertheless mentioned Phulchand Exports only for adverting/clarifying that views of this Court have remained constant till now. I must immediately clarify that it would require a Bench larger than a Five-Judge Bench to alter the legal position from what has been enunciated in Chunilal V. Mehta and Fateh Chand. The decisions of smaller Benches are relevant only for the purpose of analysing the verdict in a particular case on the predication of the elucidation of the law laid down by the Constitution Benches. This would include an oft-quoted decision in Maula Bux vs Union of India, 1969(2)SCC 554, as well as UOI vs Raman Iron Foundry, 1974(2)SCC 231, and BSNL vs Reliance Communication Ltd., 2011(1) SCC 394, etc. 14 Now I come to the next aspect of the case. The Execution proceedings were initiated by the Respondent/Decree holder on 27.10.2007 under Order XXI Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (‘CPC’ hereinafter). It transpired that Attachment Orders came to be passed. The application dated 3.7.2008, being Objections under Order XXI Rule 58 read with Section 151 CPC was preferred by the Appellant Smt. Maya Devi pleading, inter alia, that the Decree Holder had wrongly scheduled her property in the Execution Application; that she was the absolute and real owner thereof having purchased it on 12.05.2006 from Smt. Nirmal Verma, wife of Prem Chand Verma (Judgment Debtor); that she has no other connection or concern with the Judgment Debtor or with his wife in any manner whatsoever. The Appellant, therefore, respectfully prayed that her aforesaid property may kindly be released from the Schedule. Plaintiff/Decree Holder Shri Lalta Prasad, Respondent before us, countered by pleading that the Objections had been filed at the behest of the Judgment Debtor to avoid the satisfaction of the decree; that the Appellant/Objector was not the absolute and real owner of the suit property; that the duly registered General Power of Attorney executed by Smt. Nirmal Verma was forged and fabricated; that Smt. Nirmal Verma was none else than the wife of the Judgment Debtor. The Appellant has supported her stance by filing her own affidavit. In the Execution proceedings, the Plaintiff/Decree Holder/Respondent in cross-examination of the Appellant has only suggested that the documents were fabricated in collusion with Smt. Nirmal Verma. How this was possible, since they are duly registered documents, is difficult to comprehend. The other question put in cross-examination was that Smt. Nirmal Verma was never the owner of the property; and that Smt. Maya Devi’s Objections were filed at the behest of Smt. Nirmal Verma. All these suggestions had been denied. If Smt. Nirmal Verma had no title, the consequence would be that the property would revert to her predecessor-in- title, thereby placing the property beyond the pale of the Execution proceedings.

15 The following issues were framed in the Execution proceedings:-

(i) Whether the objector/applicant Smt. Maya Devi is the absolute owner of the disputed property No.X-20, Gali No.5, Brahampuri, Delhi? If so its effect?
OP Applicant.
(ii) Whether the judgment and decree dated 6.10.2007 are executable against the objector Smt. Maya Devi?
OP DH.” Smt. Nirmal Verma had also participated in the Execution proceedings and had filed her affidavit dated 22.10.2008 by way of evidence, asseverating therein that she had sold the property to Smt. Maya Devi by executing a registered General Power of Attorney, Agreement to Sell, Affidavit, Receipt, Possession Letter, Will Deed, which were duly notorised on 12.05.2006. She further stated that she had purchased the property from Shri Rajinder Parshad by means of similar documentation all of which were handed over by her to Smt. Maya Devi at the time of selling of the said property. Very significantly, she stated that her husband Prem Chand Verma/Judgment Debtor had expired on 8.10.2008.

16 In this backdrop, it needs to be kept in prospective that Order XXI Rule 97 to Rule 101 of CPC envisage the determination of all questions in Execution proceedings and not by way of an independent suit. The Executing Court, therefore, was duty bound to consider and decide the Objections filed by the Appellant with complete care and circumspection. I regret to record that this has not been done. The Objections came to be dismissed on 23.7.2010 with brevity bordering on dereliction of duty, in the following manner:-

“…. It has been submitted by the counsel for the objector that the applicant is the absolute owner of the suit property by virtue of General Power of Attorney which was registered on 12.5.2006 and she is in actual physical possession of the suit property but the counsel for the DH has stated that the objector has no legal right, title or interest as the execution of the General Power of Attorney and its registration does not confer any ownership right in favour of the applicant/objector. The counsel for DH has also relied upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled as Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited Vs State of Haryana and Another reported as (2009) 7 Supreme Court Cases 363.” 17 A perusal of the above will show that the Executing Court ignored and overlooked the important submission of the Appellant stating that she was the absolute owner of the suit property and that she had no truck whatsoever either with the Judgment Debtor Shri Prem Chand Verma or his wife Smt. Nirmal Verma beyond purchasing the subject property from the latter. What has also escaped the attention of the Court is that Suraj Lamp has prospective operation, thereby rendering it inapplicable to the subject 2006 transaction. Secondly, if the General Power of Attorney in favour of the Appellant Smt. Maya Devi was bereft of legal efficacy, the ownership of Smt. Nirmal Verma would also be invalid, and sequentially the property would have no connection whatsoever with the Judgment Debtor since he had purportedly derived title only through a Will. Unfortunately, this is also the approach which has been preferred by the High Court in terms of the impugned order. The High Court has also wrongly applied Suraj Lamp and has also neglected to reflect upon the Appellant’s plea that she is (i) the actual owner of the suit property having purchased it for valuable consideration, and (ii) being a third party not connected in any mala fide manner with the Judgment Debtor, and (iii) not having received prior notice of any action of late Shri Prem Chand Verma, was imperious to Execution proceedings. A miscarriage of justice, of monumental proportions, has taken place on an un-substantiated presumption that one of the assets of the Judgment Debtor had been illegally transferred to defeat the decree. The Appellant before us had no other recourse than to file Objections under Order XXI Rule 58 CPC.
18 Finally another aspect which has come to the fore, is the approach of the Trial Court in the adjudication of the suit. The plaint contains an averment that the suit property had already been sold. The Defendant Shri Prem Chand Verma, (his wife Smt. Nirmal Verma was not impleaded) had appeared in the Trial Court and filed his Written Statement in which, whilst admitting the documentation executed between the parties, he had denied that he had been served with any legal notice and set up the defence that he was entitled to forfeit the amount received by him because the Plaintiff/Decree Holder had failed to pay the balance sale consideration as envisaged in the Deed of Agreement for Earnest Money. After filing his Written Statement he stopped appearing, and the suit proceeded ex-parte. Significantly, the Deed of Agreement for Earnest Money as well as the Written Statement predicate Defendant’s title on a Will, and in this context there is no evidence on record that it had taken effect because of the death of the Testator. In the event, as is to be expected, no appeal against the judgment and decree came to be filed, and, therefore, the decision was not tested before or scrutinized by the Appellate Court. The absence of the Defendant does not absolve the Trial Court from fully satisfying itself of the factual and legal veracity of the Plaintiff’s claim; nay, this feature of the litigation casts a greater responsibility and onerous obligation on the Trial Court as well as the Executing Court to be fully satisfied that the claim has been proved and substantiated to the hilt by the Plaintiff. Reference to Shantilal Gulabchand Mutha vs Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited, (2013) 4 SCC 396, will be sufficient. The failure to file a Written Statement, thereby bringing Order VIII Rule 10 of the CPC into operation, or the factum of Defendant having been set ex parte, does not invite a punishment in the form of an automatic decree. Both under Order VIII Rule 10 CPC and on the invocation of Order IX of the CPC, the Court is nevertheless duty- bound to diligently ensure that the plaint stands proved and the prayers therein are worthy of being granted. .

19 I am fully mindful of the fact that the Appellant has not taken any steps for setting aside the ex parte decree against late Shri Prem Chand Verma. This is only to be expected since the Appellant/Objector has no reason to evince or harbour any interest in the inter se dispute between the Decree Holder and the Judgment Debtor. Indeed, if the Appellant had made any endeavour to assail or nullify the decree, it would be fair to conclude that she had been put up by the Judgment Debtor in an endeavour to defeat the decree. In these circumstances, my in-depth analysis of the law pertaining to decreeing what is essentially a penalty clause may, on a perfunctory or superficial reading, be viewed as non essential to the context. This, however, is not so. On a conjoint reading of Order XXI Rule 58 CPC and the fasciculus of Order XXI comprising Rules 97 to 104, it becomes clear that all questions raised by the Objector have to be comprehensively considered on their merits. In the case in hand, the decree from which the Execution proceedings emanate is not one for delivery of possession, but is a simple money decree. Order XXI proscribes the filing of a separate suit and prescribes that all relevant questions shall be determined by the Court. Objection under Order XXI should be meaningfully heard so as to avoid the possibility of any miscarriage of justice. It is significant in this regard that Rule 103 ordains that where any application has been adjudicated upon under rule 98 or rule 100, the order made thereon shall have the same force and be subject to the same conditions as to an appeal or otherwise, as if it were a decree. I shall only advert to the decisions of this Court in Brahmdeo Chaudhary vs Rishikesh Prasad Jaiswal, (1997) 3 SCC 694, Shreenath vs Rajesh, (1998) 4 SCC 543, and Tanzeem-e-sufia vs Bibi Haliman, (2002) 7 SCC 50, where proceedings were under the aforesaid fasciculus of Order XXI comprising Rules 97 to 104, in which the Objectors had set up a title distinct or different from that of the Judgment Debtor and the Court had protected their interest. The Appellant before us is a third party and has been brought into the lis by a side wind in that her property is sought to be attached with the intention of satisfying a decree in which she was not directly or intrinsically concerned.

The Appellant/Objector who has approached the Court under Order XXI Rule 58 is more advantageously or favourably placed inasmuch as she is a third party so far as the decree is concerned, and her property is not the subject-matter of the decree. It is thus clear to me that the Courts below have in a hurried, if not prejudiced manner, rejected the Objections merely because of some sympathy towards the Decree Holder. The Objections deserved to be allowed without disturbing the decree, leaving all other remedies open to the Decree Holder/Respondent, including proceedings against the Estate of the Judgment Debtor.

20 I respectfully agree with my learned Brother that the Appeal deserves to be allowed and the impugned orders require to be set aside.",1
BHASKAR LAL SHARMA,"The essential facts may be noticed at the outset.

The respondent, herein, Monica, had filed a complaint under Sections 498A, 406 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the “Penal Code”) against the appellants and one Vikas Sharma (respondent No.2). The appellants are the father and mother-in-law of the respondent-Monica whereas the subsequently impleaded respondent No. 2 is her husband.

On 21.3.2005 the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi took cognizance of the offences alleged by the respondent in the complaint petition which was numbered as 287/1A and issued summons to the appellants and the second respondent herein. Aggrieved, the appellants moved the High Court of Delhi under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the “Code”) for quashing the complaint. By judgment and order dated 21.1.2008 the High Court dismissed the application filed by the appellants. Against the said order the appellants moved this Court by means of two special leave petitions. By order dated 27.07.2009 leave was granted and the appeals registered as Criminal Appeal Nos. 1325-1326 of 2009 were disposed of by this Court holding that while no offence under Section 498A of the Penal Code was made out against either of the appellants, the offence under Section 406, as alleged, was prima facie made out against the appellant No. 2 alone.

4. Aggrieved by the said judgment and order dated 27.07.2009 of this Court, the respondent filed Review Petition Nos. 384-385 of 2009 which were dismissed by this Court by order dated 01.09.2009. Thereafter, the National Commission for Women as well as respondent herself filed Curative Petition (Crl.) Nos. 24-25 of 2010 and Curative Petition (Crl.) No. D 10575 of 2010 respectively which were allowed by this Court by order dated 14.03.2013. It is pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 14.03.2013 passed in the Curative Petitions that the present appeals were re-heard by us.

5. In the order dated 14.03.2013 passed in the Curative Petitions it has been observed that, “As far as the question regarding making out of a case under Section 498A I.P.C. is concerned, it has to be kept in mind that the appeals were against the initial order summoning the accused to stand trial. Accordingly, it was too early a stage, in our view, to take a stand as to whether any of the allegations had been established or not.”

6. However, as in the very same order dated 14.03.2013 it was made clear that “the observations made in this order is for the purposes of the hearing of the curative petitions and should not, in any way, prejudice the outcome of the appeals, when they are heard afresh”, we have proceeded to re-hear the appeals on its own merit.

We would also like to observe, at this stage, that in the present appeals the only question that would require to be decided is whether on the allegations made in the complaint petition filed by the respondent a prima facie case of commission of offences under Sections 498A and 406 of the Penal Code is made out against the appellants. We will not be concerned with such allegations made against the second respondent who, though named as accused No. 1 in the complaint, had chosen not to question the same. In fact, the said accused has been brought on the record of the present proceedings as respondent No. 2 on the basis of an application filed by the respondent Monica claiming that the addition of her husband as a respondent is necessary for the purposes of facilitating a reconciliation which, however, did not materialise though was attempted.

7. We have read and considered the statements made by the complainant (respondent herein) in the complaint petition, particularly those in paragraphs 16, 17, 18, 19, 24 and 29 thereof. The said paragraphs have also been noticed by the High Court in its order dated 21.01.2008. A detailed recital of the manner in which the present appellants and the respondent No. 2 had allegedly ill-treated the respondent-complainant after her marriage and had withheld different items of her stridhan property has been set out by the respondent-complainant in the aforesaid paragraphs of her complaint.

8. Shri Amarendra Sharan, learned senior counsel for the appellants has urged that the statements/averments made in the complaint petition, even if taken to be correct, do not make out any offence against any of the accused appellants either under Sections 498A or 406 of the Penal Code, as alleged. Shri Sharan has laid stress on the fact that there is no averment in the complaint petition with regard to any demand for dowry by the appellants; or of any ill-treatment of the respondent by the appellants or commission of any act in connection with any such demand which could amount to ‘cruelty’ within the meaning of Section 498A IPC. Shri Sharan has also urged that no where in the complaint petition entrustment within the meaning of Section 405 of the Penal Code has been alleged against the appellants so as to even prima facie make the appellants liable for the offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code.

9. We disagree. ‘Cruelty’ as defined in the Explanation to Section 498A of the Penal Code has a twofold meaning. The contentions of Shri Sharan do not deal with the Explanation (a) and is exclusively confined to the meaning dealt with by Explanation (b). Under Explanation (a) conduct which is likely to cause injury or danger to life, limb or health (mental or physical) would come within the meaning of the expression “cruelty”. While instances of physical torture would be plainly evident from the pleadings, conduct which has caused or is likely to cause mental injury would be far more subtle. Having given our anxious consideration to the averments made in the complaint petition, we are of the view that the statements made in the relevant paragraphs of the complaint can be understood as containing allegations of mental cruelty to the complainant. The complaint, therefore, cannot be rejected at the threshold.

10. The facts, as alleged, therefore will have to be proved which only be done in the course of a regular trial. It is wholly unnecessary for us to embark upon a discourse as regards the scope and ambit of the Court’s power to quash a criminal proceeding. Appreciation, even in a summary manner, of the averments made in a complaint petition or FIR would not be permissible at the stage of quashing and the facts stated will have to be accepted as they appear on the very face of it. This is the core test that has to be applied before summoning the accused. Once the aforesaid stage is overcome, the facts alleged have to be proved by the complainant/prosecution on the basis of legal evidence in order to establish the penal liability of the person charged with the offence.

11. Insofar as the offence under Section 406 of the Penal Code is concerned, it is clear from the averments made in paragraphs 16, 18, 24 and 29 of the complaint petition that it has been alleged that the appellants were entrusted or had exercised dominion over the property belonging to the respondent and further that the appellants had unlawfully retained the same. The statements made in para 6 of the complaint also alleges retention of cash and other gifts received by the respondent-complainant at the time of her marriage to the accused-appellant No. 2. In the face of the said averments made in the complaint petition, it cannot be said that the complaint filed by the respondent is shorn of the necessary allegations to prima facie sustain the case of commission of the offence under Section 406 by the appellants.

12. In view of the above, we unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that the complaint petition registered as Complaint No. 287/1A (Monica Vs. Vikas Sharma and Others) presently pending in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi cannot be interdicted but has to be finally concluded by the learned Trial Court. We, therefore, dismiss the appeals filed by the accused and in view of the time that has elapsed, we direct that the trial be completed expeditiously and in any case within a period of one year from the date of receipt of a copy of this order by the learned Trial Court.

Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 101/2013

13. Monica, the respondent in the Criminal Appeals dealt with by this order, has instituted this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking the following reliefs :

“(A) To serve notice to the Respondent No.1 Sh. Vikas Sharma through his mother Smt. Vimla Sharma who is being represented by ld. Counsel/AOR Shri Sumit Attri in SLP(Crl.) No. 4125-4126/2008.
(B) To tag the instant writ petition with SLP (Crl.) No. 4125-
4126/2008 entitled Bhaskar Lal Sharma & Anr. Versus Monica & Ors.
(C) To direct the Respondent No.1 to immediately pay the maintenance arrears to the tune of Rs.55,65,000(Sept 2004-June 2013 to the petitioner-wife alongwith 50% penalty amount of Rs. 27,82,500.
D) To direct the Respondent No.1 to pay Rs. 93,500 per month to the petitioner from July 2013 onwards.”
14. It appears that by an order dated 03.07.2007 passed under Section 125 of the Code by the learned A.C.M.M., New Delhi in Complaint Case No. 176/1/1006 maintenance has been granted to the writ petitioner at the rate of Rs. 50,000/- per month with effect from 4.9.2004. An application dated 30.11.2011 had been filed by the writ petitioner before the Family Court No. 2, Saket, New Delhi for payment of the arrears of maintenance as also the current monthly maintenance. The said petition numbered as Petition No. M-298/2011 is presently pending.

15. The order passed under Section 125 of the Code granting maintenance to the writ petitioner appears to have attained finality in law. Such an order can be executed by following the provisions of sub-Section (3) of Section 125 of the Code. The scope and ambit of the said provision of the Code has recently been dealt with in Poongodi and Another Vs. Thangavel[1] wherein reference has been made to several earlier decisions on the issue. When the enforcement and execution of an order passed under a statute is contemplated by the statute itself, normally, an aggrieved litigant has to take recourse to the remedy provided under the statute. In fact the petitioner has initiated a proceeding for execution of the order of maintenance granted in her favour. The fact that the husband (respondent herein) against whom the order of maintenance is required to be enforced lives outside the territory of India, in our considered view, cannot be a reasonable basis for invoking the extraordinary remedy under Article 32 of the Constitution inasmuch as the provisions of the Code i.e. Section 105 makes elaborate provisions for service of summons in case the person summoned by the court resides outside the territory of India. Comprehensive guidelines have been laid down by the Government of India with regard to service of summons/notices/judicial process on persons residing abroad. In view of the remedy that is available to the petitioner under the Code and having regard to the fact that resort to such remedy has already been made, we decline to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution in facts of the present case. Instead, we direct the Family Court No. 2, Saket, New Delhi to pass appropriate final orders in Petition No.M-298/2011 as expeditiously as possible. We would also like to make it clear that in the event it is found so necessary the learned Family Court may transfer the case to the competent criminal court whereafter the concerned criminal court will make all endeavour to bring the proceeding to a early conclusion.

16. We, therefore, dispose of the writ petition in the above terms",0
Nanak Ram,"This judgment shall dispose of three appeals in Criminal appeal Nos.1985 of 2010 filed by the appellant Nanak Ram/Accused and Criminal Appeal No.342 of 2011 filed by appellants/Accused Mohan Ram and Surja Ram against their conviction and sentence, and Criminal Appeal Nos. 1991 of 2010, 1990 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.1992 of 2010 filed by the State of Rajasthan for the enhancement of the sentence against the above mentioned accused, respectively.

2. The case of the prosecution in brief is as follows : PW 7 Shera Ram is the younger brother of deceased Shivji Ram and they had obtained land from Gram Panchayat towards the western side of the village and obtained Pattas for the said land. Accused Bhera Ram and accused Chuna Ram are real brothers while accused Surja Ram and accused Mohan Ram are sons of accused Sadula Ram. Accused Bhera Ram and Sadula Ram told Shivji Ram and Shera Ram that they will not allow them to take the land and will snatch it from them. Two months prior to occurrence Shivji Ram and Shera Ram erected fencing around their land whereupon the accused Bhera Ram and other accused were seriously annoyed over the same. On the occurrence day i.e. on 29.5.1983 at 10.30 a.m. Shivji Ram and both his younger brothers were repairing/re-erecting the fencing in their land, accused persons Bhera Ram, Sadula Ram and his sons Mohan Ram and Surja Ram, Gordhan Ram, Nanak Ram and Chuna Ram, all duly armed entered into Bara from south side and started dismantling the fence. Shivji Ram and his brothers questioned the same by saying that they have obtained Patta from the Panchayat. Thereupon Bhera Ram and Surja Ram simultaneously inflicted Barchhi blow on the head of Shivji Ram, as a result of which he fell down and all the accused attacked him with their weapons. Shera Ram intervened and accused Mohan Ram inflicted Barchhi blow which landed on the left side of his head and accused Chuna Ram inflicted the jei blow on his right leg. Then all the accused started beating whereupon his sister Dhuri came running and fell upon Shera Ram in order to protect him. PW 11 Balu Ram and PW 2 Mangi Lal who were present at the occurrence place were threatened by the accused and they got frieghtened and saw the occurrence standing by the side of the road. After that all the accused went away. Shivji Ram died on the spot.

3. Some unknown person gave a telephonic information about the occurrence to the Police Station Nokha on 29.5.1983 and after making Exh.P-54 entry in the Roznamcha PW 13 Attar Ali Khan went to the occurrence place and found Shivji Ram lying dead and Shera Ram with injuries and he recorded Exh.P9 statement of Shera Ram, sent him to Nokha Hospital for treatment. He forwarded Exh.P9 statement to the Police Station for registering the case and Exh. P55 FIR came to be registered. He conducted inquest on the body of Shivji Ram and prepared Exh.P5 ‘inquest report’. He prepared Exh.P3 site plan and Exh.P45 site inspection note. He seized blood stained earth and ordinary earth under Exh. P33 and also seized jeis used by the accused Chuna Ram, Nanak Ram from the occurrence place and the blood stained wooden jei under Exh. P34. He also seized the footwear of Shivji Ram viz. Exh.P35 and sent the body for post mortem.

4. Dr. Moti Lal Mishra (PW 9) conducted the autopsy on the body of Shivji Ram and found the following 9 injuries:

i) An incised wound of 6-½” x ½” and deep upto brain on the head,

ii) a punctured wound of 1 x ½ x ½ cm on the left knee joint deep to the bone;

iii) multiple contusion of 1 cm each incised on the left elbow joint;

iv) an abrasion 1 x ½ cm on the left ring finger dorsally;

v) a contusion of 4 x 2 cm on the lower half of the left leg anteriorly;

vi) swelling 2 x 2 cm on the left leg near the 5th injury;

vii) a contusion of 1 x 1 cm on the right thigh

viii) an abrasion 3 x 1 cm on the right knee joint near the ankle joint; and

ix) an abrasion on the right middle finger dorsally.

He issued Exh. P 33 Post Mortem report by expressing opinion that the death has occurred due to destruction of all the elements of brain and shock due to excessive bleeding.

5. PW 9 Dr. Moti Lal Mishra examined Shera Ram in the Nokha hospital and found the following 11 injuries on him:

i) One crushed wound of 4 x 3 cm bone deep on lower half of the left leg interiorly;

ii) One crushed wound of 1cm x .5x.5 cm on middle 1/3 of the right leg laterally;

iii) Contusion of 15 x 1.5 cm on the lower portion of glutal region;

iv) An abrasion 3 x ½ cm on the right scapula;

v) One crushed wound of 6 x 1 x 1.5 cm on the left side of the head, 7 cm above the left ear,

vii) Swelling 4 x 3 cm on the right palm;

viii) An abrasion 1 x ½ cm on the left thumb laterally;

ix) A contusion of 6 x 1 cm on the middle half of the right thigh medially;

x) A contusion of 3 x 1 cm on the right thigh 2 cm above the ninth injury and

xi) Contusion two in number, one of 4 x 1 cm and another of 3 x 1 cm on the upper half of the right glutal.

He opined that all the above injuries were simple in nature and issued Exh. P 32 Injury Report.

6. After completing investigation challan was filed in the Court of Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate Nokha against all the accused persons. Accused Nanak Ram was absconding. The other accused persons namely Bhera Ram, Sadula Ram, Chuna Ram, Surja Ram, Mohan Ram and Gordhan Ram were tried in Sessions Case No.63 of1983 for the alleged offences under Section 302, 307, 323 and 324 all read with Section 149 IPC and also the offence under Section 147 and 148 IPC. The prosecution examined 13 witnesses and tendered in evidence 59 documents. The learned Sessions Judge convicted accused Bhera Ram and Surja Ram for the offences under Section 302 read with section 149 IPC and sentenced them each to undergo imprisonment for life. He also convicted accused persons Sadula Ram, Mohan Ram and Gordhan Ram for the offences under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced them each to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment. Besides he convicted accused persons namely Surja Ram, Bhera Ram, Gordhan Ram and Mohan Ram for the offence under Section 148 IPC and sentenced them each to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment He also convicted Sadula Ram for the offence under Section 147 IPC and sentenced him to undergo 3 months rigorous imprisonment. In addition he convicted accused persons Surja Ram, Bhera Ram, Mohan Ram, Sadula Ram and Gordhan Ram for the offence under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced them each to undergo 6 months rigorous imprisonment and directed all the sentences to run concurrently. However, he acquitted accused Chuna Ram of the charges.

7. All the five convicted accused persons preferred appeal in Appeal No.428 of 1984 on the file of High Court of Judicature of Rajasthan, at Jodhpur, challenging their conviction and sentences. The State of Rajasthan challenged the complete acquittal of Chuna Ram and the acquittal of accused persons Sadula Ram, Mohan Ram and Gordhan Ram for the offences under Section 302 read with 149 IPC , in Appeal No.106 of 1985. During the pendency of the appeals four accused persons namely Sadula Ram, Gordhan Ram, Bhera Ram and Chuna Ram died, with the result the appeal preferred against them in Appeal No. 106 of 1985 abated and the said appeal continued only as against the accused Mohan Ram. Like wise Appeal No.428 of 1984 preferred by the accused persons Bhera Ram, Sadula Ram, Gordhan Ram also stood abated and it continued on behalf of accused Surja Ram and Mohan Ram only.

8. The High Court of Rajasthan partly allowed the appeal in Appeal No.428 of 1984 filed by the accused Surja Ram by setting aside his conviction for the offence under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC and instead convicted him under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced him to undergo 5 years rigorous imprisonment and the other conviction and sentences imposed on him were maintained. At the same time it dismissed the appeal in Appeal No.428 of 1984 preferred by accused Mohan Ram, by confirming the conviction and sentence imposed on him. The High Court also dismissed the Appeal No.106 of 1985 preferred by the State of Rajasthan against accused Mohan Ram.

9. The accused Nanak Ram on being apprehended was tried in Sessions Case No.24 of 1985 and the learned Sessions Judge, Bikaner convicted him for the offence under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment. He also convicted him for the offence under Section 148 IPC and sentenced him to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment and further convicted him for the offence under Section 324 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced him to undergo one year rigorous imprisonment and in addition he convicted him for the offence under Section 323 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced him to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment and further he convicted him for the offence under Section 447 IPC and sentenced him to undergo two months rigorous imprisonment and directed all sentences to run concurrently. Challenging the conviction and sentence Nanak Ram preferred appeal in Criminal Appeal No.314 of 1990 on the file of High Court of Judicature at Rajasthan at Jodhpur and the High Court partly allowed the appeal by setting aside the conviction under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC and instead convicted him for offence under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced him to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment and maintained all the other convictions and sentences imposed by the Sessions Court.

10. Challenging their convictions and sentences imposed by the High Court on them accused Nanak Ram, Mohan Ram and Surja Ram preferred Criminal Appeal referred to above and the State of Rajasthan also filed appeals against the above accused seeking for enhancement of the sentences imposed on them. All these appeals were heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.

11. Mr. Mahabir Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the occurrence took place about 30 years ago and accused persons went to the occurrence place only to remove the fence put up by Shivji Ram and his brothers and when it was resisted a free fight followed which was accidental and there was no intention to kill and only one blow on the head of Shivji Ram was fatal and the other injuries were only minor injuries, and the Courts below have failed to appreciate that there are material improvements and infirmities in the prosecution case and the presence of eye witnesses is highly doubtful and the conviction of appellants is wholly unwarranted and liable to be set aside. The alternative plea of the learned counsel for the appellants was that the appellants have undergone three years of their sentence and they be granted the benefit of probation under the provision of Section 360 of Code of Criminal Procedure as well as under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and in support of the submission he relied on the decision of this Court in State of Karnataka vs. Muddappa (1999) 5 SCC 732 and Eliamma and Another vs. State of Karnataka (2009) 11 SCC 42.

12. Per contra Ms. Sonia Mathur, learned counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan strenuously contended that Shivji Ram and his brothers are the Patta holders of the land and lease deeds have been executed by the Panchayat in their favour and the accused persons having failed in their legal proceedings had decided to attack the brothers and take forcible possession of the land and in pursuance of the said common object all the seven accused persons duly armed forcibly entered the land and inflicted injuries on Shivji Ram with barchhi and jei resulting in instantaneous death and also inflicted injuries on his younger brother Shera Ram and the alteration made by the High Court on the conviction from Section 302 IPC read with Section 149 IPC to one under Section 304 Part II IPC read with Section 149 IPC is erroneous and legally unsustainable. In support of her submissions she relied on the decisions of this Court in Mahesh Balmiki alias Munna vs. State of M.P. (2000)1 SCC 319 and Arun Nivalaji More vs. State of Maharashtra (2006) 12 SCC
13. The prosecution has examined PW 7 Shera Ram, PW 2, Mandi Lal, PW6 Dhuri and PW11 Balu Ram as having witnessed the occurrence. PW7 Shera Ram and PW 11 Balu Ram are the younger brothers of deceased Shivji Ram and PW6 Dhuri is their sister. PW 7 Shera Ram was also injured during the occurrence and according to him on the occurrence day namely on 29.5.1983 at 10.30 a.m. Shivji Ram and both his brothers were repairing/re-erecting the fencing in their Patta Land and accused persons Bhera Ram, Sadula Ram and his sons Mohan Ram and Surja Ram, Gordhan Ram, Nanak Ram and Chuna Ram armed with weapons entered into Bara from south side and started dismantling the fence and they questioned the same by saying that they have obtained Patta from Panchayat and at that time Bhera Ram and Surja Ram inflicted Barchhi blow on the head of Shivji Ram as a result of which he fell down and all the accused attacked him with their weapons and when he intervened accused Mohan Ram inflicted barchhi blow on the left side of his head and accused Chuna Ram inflicted jei blow on his right leg and other accused also started beating him whereupon his sister Dhuri came running and fell upon him in order to protect him and the accused persons also threatened PW 11 Balu Ram and PW2 Mangi Lal and being frightened they stood by the side of the road and saw the occurrence and Shivji Ram died on the spot. PW7 Shera Ram sustained as many as 11 injuries on his person as a result of the attack made by all the accused on him at the time of occurrence. PW 11 Balu Ram was involved in the fencing of the land along with his brothers and his presence in the occurrence place cannot doubted. PW 2 Mangi Lal happened to be with Shivji Ram in his land and he has witnessed the occurrence. He is an independent witness. On seeing the attack made by the accused on her brothers PW 6 Dhuri came running and tried to protect Shera Ram by falling upon him. The testimonies of PW2 Mangi Lal, PW6 Dhuri, PW11 Balu Ram are natural cogent and in all material particulars corroborated the testimony of PW7 Shera Ram. Accepting their testimonies it is clear that during the occurrence all the seven accused as members of unlawful assembly have inflicted injuries with their weapons on deceased Shivji Ram and PW 7 Shera Ram.

14. Shivji Ram died of homicidal violence is established by the medical evidence adduced in the case. PW9 Dr. Moti Lal Mishra conducted autopsy on the body of Shivji Ram and found on the head an incised wound of 6½” x ½” deep upto brain and on internal examination the destruction of the elements of the brain. He also found eight other injuries on the other parts of the body. He issued Exh. P33 post mortem report and expressed opinion that the death has occurred due to destruction of the elements of brain and shock due to excessive bleeding. In the oral testimony PW9 Dr. Moti Lal Mishra has categorically stated that injury No.1 found on the head was itself sufficient to cause death. There is no doubt that Shivji Ram died of injuries sustained during the occurrence. It is further relevant to note that PW9 Dr. Moti Lal Mishra examined PW7 Shera Ram immediately after the occurrence in Nokha hospital and found 11 injuries on him. Ex.P.32 is the injury report issued by him mentioning the injuries. According to him all the injuries are simple in nature.

15. Telephonic information about the occurrence was given to Nokha Police Station by some unknown person on 29.5.1983 itself and PW13 Attar Ali Khan after making Exh.P54 entry in the Roznamcha, immediately went to the occurrence place and found Shivji Ram lying dead and Shera Ram with injuries. He recorded Exh.P9 statement of Shera Ram and sent him to Nokha hospital for treatment and forwarded the statement to the Police Station for registering the case Exh.P55 is the First Information Report. He also seized jeis used by the accused from the occurrence place under Exh.P34 Mazhar. There is no delay in registering case and there is no flaw in the investigation.

16. It is true that the accused party had land dispute with the victim party. The Collector ordered conversion of subject land into abadi and on the applications made by Shivji Ram and his two brothers, Pattas were issued as evident from P12, P16, P17, P20, P21 and P24. Accused Bhera Ram preferred appeals against the grant of Patta to Panchayat Samiti at the first instance and they came to be dismissed and the revision preferred before the Collector was pending. PW8 Sarpanch Dhura Ram and PW5 record keeper Hanuman Das have stated so. Thus the evidence shows that the accused party was desirous to get the subject land to themselves and were taking legal steps to achieve it. On coming to know of the fencing put by Shivji Ram and his brothers they were annoyed and went there to remove the fencing. While they were dismantling the fencing, Shivji Ram and his brothers came there and objected to it by saying that they have obtained Patta and a sudden quarrel erupted.

17. A fight suddenly takes place for which both parties are more or less to be blamed and it is a combat whether with or without weapons. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious turn it did. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. Out of the 9 injuries, only injury no.1 was held to be of grievous nature, which was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of the deceased. The assaults were made at random. Even the previous altercations were verbal and not physical. The earlier disputes over land do not appear to have assumed the characteristics of physical combat. This goes to show that in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel the accused persons had caused injuries on the deceased. That being so the Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is applicable. The fact situation bears great similarity to that in Ghapoo Yadav & Ors. vs. State of M.P. (2003) 3 SCC 528.

18. Looking at the nature of injuries sustained by the deceased and the circumstances as enumerated above the conclusion is irresistible that the death was caused by the acts of the accused done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and therefore the offence would squarely come within the first part of Section 304 IPC and the appellants would be liable to be convicted for the said offence. The conviction of the appellants/accused under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149 IPC by the High Court is liable to be set aside.

19. We are of the considered view that imposition of 7 years rigorous imprisonment on each of the appellants for the conviction under Section 304 Part I IPC would meet the ends of justice. We sustain the other conviction and sentences imposed on the appellants. We are also of the view that the appellants are not entitled for release on probation.

20. In the result Criminal Appeal No.1990 of 2010, 1991 of 2010 and 1992 of 2010 preferred by the State of Rajasthan against the accused persons Nanak Ram, Mohan Ram and Surja Ram are partly allowed and their conviction for the offence under Section 304 Part II IPC read with Section 149 IPC and the sentences of 5 years rigorous imprisonment each are set aside and instead they are convicted for the offence under Section 304 Part I read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced to undergo seven years rigorous imprisonment each. All other convictions and sentences imposed on them by the High Court are maintained. Criminal Appeal No.1985 of 2010 and 342 of 2011 are dismissed.",0
Larsen & Toubro Ltd,"On an application preferred by the respondent herein under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), the High Court has appointed/nominated an Arbitrator on behalf of the appellant herein on the ground that in spite of notice by the respondent in this behalf, the appellant had failed to nominate its Arbitrator in terms of Clause 25 of the Agreement entered into between the parties. Since the respondent had already nominated its Arbitrator, further direction is given that the two Arbitrators (one nominated by respondent and one appointed by the Court for the appellant), shall appoint an Umpire in consonance with the said Clause 25. This order is impugned by the appellant primarily on the ground that Clause 25 was modified by three supplementary agreements whereby the entire edifice of the said arbitration clause stood adhered and on a conjoint reading of original Clause 25 with modification effected by the supplementary agreements, there was no question of arbitration between the appellant and the respondent at this stage. To appreciate this contention, one will have to traverse through the relevant clauses of the main contract as well as supplementary agreements. Thus, we would like to state along with the events, as they occurred, in chorology. In fact, as we proceed to unfurl the events with our comments thereon, there and then we shall be getting answer as well to the issue involved.

2. An agreement dated 29.2.1988 was entered into between the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE) and the appellant namely Larsen & Toubro (L&T Ltd.). This agreement was for construction of Twin Tower Office Complex at Laxmi Nagar District Centre, Delhi which was awarded by the SCOPE to the appellant. Original contract value for this work was stipulated at Rs.27.48 Crores. Works comprised of the Civil Works and also subsidiary works, that could be ordered from time to time by SCOPE/Architect. This agreement also permitted the appellant to sub-contract. Accordingly, the appellant entered into an agreement dated 3.3.1988 with the respondent. While retaining the civil works with itself, the appellant awarded finishing works including brickworks, wood works, flooring, furnishing, aluminum works and other miscellaneous works including waterproofing etc. to the respondent. It was a pass through contract on a back to back basis. The value of sub contract was stated as Rs.12.08 crores. Clause 2 of this agreement dated 3.3.1988 pertains to the payments which were to be made by the appellant to the respondent. As can be seen from the reading of this Clause, as reproduced below, amount under this sub contract was payable to the respondent by the appellant only on receipt of corresponding receipts from SCOPE:

“Clause 2 – L&T shall pay “MHB” the said contract amount or such other sum as shall become payable only as and when the said payments are received by “L&T” from SCOPE at the time and in the manner hereinafter specified in the terms and conditions of this Contract.”
3. Another important stipulation in this sub contract was Clause 6, as per which the respondent was to perform the work awarded to it to the satisfaction of SCOPE, namely the Principal. It reads as under:

“Clause 6 – All obligations in respect of ancillary works undertaken by MHB shall be performed by MHB itself and will not jeopardize the interest and contract of L&T with SCOPE. Satisfaction of SCOPE, their representatives and Architects shall form the basis of this agreement.”
4. Clause 25 of the agreement between the appellant and the respondent provides for arbitration for settlement of disputes. Relevant part of this Clause reads as under:

“Clause 25 – Except where otherwise provided in the contract, all questions, disputes, certificates excluding “excepted matters” relating to this contract shall be referred to a Sole Arbitrator in case claims are upto and including Rs.10 lakhs to be appointed by the General Manager (Civil), L&T and for claiming over Rs.10 lakhs by panel of 3 Arbitrators of who one will be appointed by General Manager (Civil), L&T the other by BHR and an umpire appointed in advance jointly by the two Arbitrators….” ……No award of the arbitration/umpire shall be binding on L&T unless MHB had furnished complete opportunity to L&T to file a similar claim on SCOPE and only upon L&T receiving any payment from SCOPE under the award which L&T may get in its favour on the subject matter of work.”
5. The position which prevailed up to this stage was that for the works undertaken by the respondent, it could receive the payments only when such payments were made by SCOPE to the appellant. Further, all questions and disputes between the appellant and the respondent were to be referred to a sole arbitrator where the claim was up to Rs.10 lakhs and three arbitrators for claims beyond 10 lakhs. The arbitrator(s) was not supposed to deal with “excepted matters”, so stated in the certificates. However, even if the award of the arbitrator/umpire was in favour of the respondent, respondent could not receive payment under the said award unless such a payment was received by the appellant from SCOPE under the award. In that event, the respondent was to provide an opportunity to the appellant to raise those claims with SCOPE. On receiving the payments from SCOPE either under the arbitration award between SCOPE and the appellant or otherwise, the appellant was supposed to honour the award passed in favour of the respondent. In essence, the parties understood that as the Principal/Employer was SCOPE, for whom the work was to be performed by virtue of main agreement dated 29.2.1988 entered into between parties and the sub contract between the appellant and respondent was on back to back basis, any work done by the respondent was for the benefit of SCOPE and ultimately liability for honoring the claims of the respondents was that of SCOPE and the appellant was not supposed to make any payment from its coffers.

6. The parties even acted on the basis of aforesaid understanding initially. There were certain claims of the respondent and the appellant in turn raised those claims with SCOPE. A settlement was reached between the appellant and SCOPE with respect to those claims whereby the appellant was given a sum of Rs.2.15 crores by SCOPE. The appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement dated 31.1.1990 for apportioning the aforesaid amount, whereby a sum of RS.77.40 lacs was paid to the respondent towards full and final settlement of claims/ price escalation on works due to hindrance caused in execution of work and to complete the balance work. At the same time, another important understanding was also reached between the parties. While making this apportionment, the modalities of settling the disputes between the parties through arbitrator also underwent a significant change. This is clear from Clause (viii) of the first supplementary agreement which reads as under:

“The Agreement provides that all disputes between the parties shall be settled through arbitration. It is now expressly agreed that any dispute or difference which MHB might have with L&T under the agreement or SCOPE might have with L&T under the main contract between then relating to the part of work that is to be executed by MHB, shall be deemed disputes jointly between MHB and L&T and SCOPE under the main contract and L&T will refer all such disputes to SCOPE for settlement by negotiation. If SCOPE does not settle the same by negotiation, then L&T will refer the said disputes for arbitration with SCOPE a/on with any other disputes which L&T might have with SCOPE in terms of the arbitration clause provided in the main contract. MHB shall in such an event, help prepare claims and statement of case relating to their scope of work and render all assistance and cooperation as may be required in successfully pursuing arbitration. MHB shall bear proportionately cost of arbitration relating to their scope of work. The award of the arbitration on all such matters in dispute claims and counter claims relating to the MHB’s scope of works shall be binding on both MHB and L&T and all such disputes between MHB and L&T shall be deemed to have been settled accordingly and shall not be referable to arbitration again between MHB and L&T under the agreement.”
7. This clause acknowledges the fact that for the work done by the respondent under the sub contract, there could be two kinds of situations. There could be a situation where there would be disputes and differences between the appellant and the respondent for the works done by the respondent. This could be regarding the workmanship or the amounts payable for the work done etc. There could also be a situation where SCOPE is not satisfied with the workmanship or may raise dispute about the quantum of bills etc. resulting into denial of payment or short payment to the appellant for the work undertaken by the respondent under the sub contract. The Clause (viii) in the first supplementary agreement provided that such disputes will be deemed to have been raised jointly between the respondent and appellant on the one side and SCOPE on the other side. For this reason, this Clause further provided that appellant was to refer such disputes to SCOPE for settlement by negotiation failing which arbitration (as per mechanism provided in the Clause between the appellant and SCOPE). In order to lodge these claims suitably and properly, the respondent was supposed to assist and cooperate the appellant. Such an assistance was expected in successfully pursuing arbitration as well. Reason for such a collaborative effort, with synergy between the two parties synergize, was too obvious. Since the respondent has undertaken the work, its inputs could immensely help the appellant in prosecuting the claims efficaciously and potently. Further, by participating the respondent would have satisfaction that its interest is appropriately taken care of. It was even supposed to bear proportionate cost of arbitration. It was, thus, clear intention that the claims of the respondent were to be taken up by the appellant and raise with SCOPE and in the event SCOPE disputing those claims, get those claims adjudicated through arbitration. In that sense, both the appellant and respondent were on one side as co-claimants. However, since the respondent is not a party to the main agreement dated 29.9.1988 which is entered into between the appellant and SCOPE, the respondent was supposed to give the assistance and cooperate in the manner provided in this Clause. It is for this reason that this Clause unambiguously further provided that in view of the arbitration between the appellant and SCOPE, pertaining to the claims of the respondent as well, even if the disputes between the appellant and the respondent were deemed to have been settled and were not referable to arbitration again between these two parties.

8. On reading Clause 25 in the original agreement pertaining to the process of arbitration along with the modified mechanism agreed to between the parties in the aforesaid first supplementary agreement, the parties for making the change is clearly discernable. As per the original clause, the disputes between the appellant and the respondent were to be referred to the arbitral tribunal. After the rendition of award by the arbitral tribunal, money was still not payable under the award to the respondent. Instead, in order to recover those moneys from SCOPE, it was for the appellant to file a similar claim on SCOPE and on receiving the payment from SCOPE under the award, the appellant was to give the money to the respondent as per the award between the appellant and the respondent. It amounted to indulging in double exercise, viz. (1) an arbitration between the parties herein and thereafter another arbitration relating to subject matter between the appellant and SCOPE. (2) In order to rationalize and eliminate the dual exercise, the parties agreed that instead of resorting to arbitration between themselves, both would join together and prefer those claims with SCOPE. This modified process of arbitration, as envisaged in the first supplementary agreement, was much more rationale which appealed to reason.

9. The next event which took place cemented the aforesaid mechanism between the parties. It appears that there were further claims of the respondent which were raised by the appellant with SCOPE. SCOPE agreed to make payments and to apportion those payments between the appellant and the respondent, these two parties entered into another supplementary agreement dated 8.12.1993. The recital to this agreement is of paramount importance for our purposes. It records:

“L&T has, therefore, invoked the arbitration clause under L&T’s contract with SCOPE and referred all the claims including those relating to MHB on 29.5.1992 to arbitration, which is now pending.”
10. The parties acted as per modified understanding. It was further agreed whatever claims are received by the appellant from the SCOPE, they shall be shared between the appellant and respondent in the ratio of 67:33. The understanding between the parties that for any claims of the respondent, both the parties were to join together and raise claims against SCOPE was reinforced by Clause 6 in the said agreement which again provided an underlined message that in so far as the appellant and the respondent are concerned, they shall not resort to any arbitration between themselves on this account. For better appreciation, we reproduce Clause 6 herein below, of the second supplementary agreement, dated 8.12.1993:

”That L&T and MHB shall not undertake any other arbitration as between them in respect of the claims referred to pending arbitration, except to share the proceeds or liabilities as stated above by way of accord and satisfaction.”
11. In the aforesaid arbitration, two Member Arbitral Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.15.02 crores approximately (which was subsequently reduced to Rs.13.23 crores by mutual negotiation) and as per the second supplementary agreement, that amount was shared between the appellant and the respondent whereby appellant paid a sum of Rs.4.58 crores to the respondent. So much so, when the amount of Rs.15.02 crores, as awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal against SCOPE and in favour of the appellant was reduced to 13.23 crores, this arrangement was endoresed by the respondent as well by entering into third supplementary agreement dated 6.2.1995. The significance of this agreement, for the purpose of present case, is Clauses 5 and 16 thereof. Therefore, we reproduce hereinunder both these Clauses:

“Clause 5 – Any claim arising after the date covered by the said award, shall as far as possible settled mutually by negotiation. It is mutually agreed by the parties that any such disputes, shall be identified but shall not be referred to arbitration on the owner (SCOPE herein) until the completion of the project. This would facilitate concentration of the concerted efforts of the parties for timely completion of the project. The reference of disputes, if any, to arbitration after completion of the project shall be in accordance with the terms of first supplementary agreement dated 31.01.1990. Any further arbitration if referred to the owner after completion of the work, the Award arising out of this arbitration shall be share in promotion of the claims referred to the works of each of the parties herein.
Clause 16 – The parties further agrees amend and modify clause 25 of the General Conditions of Contract dated 3.3.1988 which deals with settlement of Disputes by Arbitration to the limited extent that in the event of any fresh reference of disputes to arbitration, the Arbitrator or arbitrators as the case may be shall be bound to give speaking award. This Clause 25 is subject to the terms of the first supplementary agreement dated 31.01.1990 which modified the agreement dated 03.03.1988.”
12. Following aspects emerge from the reading of these two Clauses:

(a) The parties herein agreed to settle the claims between themselves through negotiations, in the first instance.
(b) Even if there were disputes between the appellant and the respondent they were only to be identified but could not be referred to arbitration with SCOPE until completion of the project.
(c) Even on the completion of the project, the mechanism of raising the disputes had to remain the same as was agreed to earlier in the first supplementary agreement dated 31.1.1990 viz. appellant had to raise the claims with SCOPE in cooperation with the respondent and there was not to be any inter-se arbitration between these parties.
(d) Clause 25 as contained in the original agreement dated 3.3.1988 between the appellant and the respondent pertaining to the arbitration was specifically made subject to the logistic provided in the first supplementary agreement dated 31.1.1990 making it abundantly clear that Clause 25 stood modified by the supplementary agreement.
13. Some further claims, out of the aforesaid contract arose and the appellant submitted those claims to SCOPE in October, 2000 which were up to date in November 2000. These were made jointly by these parties on SCOPE in August 2001. They were up dated again in December 2002 and January 2003 in concert with each other.

14. Now the stage came which led to present proceedings. While the things stood at the aforesaid level, the respondent decided to close the contract sometime in the year 2002. We are not required to go into the nitty gritty of this event viz. as to whether the respondent abandoned the site or it had completed the project. Suffice it is to note that the respondent raised many claims with the appellant and also served legal notice dated 31.1.2004 in this behalf. It nominated its arbitrator and called upon the respondent to appoint its arbitrator for settling the disputes between them. The appellant replied by denying the contents of the legal notice. This denial of the appellant prompted the respondent to file the application under Section 11 of the Act seeking a direction to the appellant to appoint its arbitrator. The exact prayer made in this application was as under:

“(a) Appoint an Arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent in terms of Clause 25 of the Contract Agreement dated 3rd of March 1988 between the parties as modified by Supplementary Agreement dated 31st January 1990 and 6th February 1995.
(b) Direct the Arbitrators appointed by the applicant and that appoint on behalf of the respondent to appoint an umpire in terms of Clause 25 of the Contract Agreement dated 3rd March, 1988.”
15. It is in this application, as mentioned above, impugned orders are passed by the High Court holding that Clause 25 still survived and the arbitral tribunal can be constituted for adjudication of the disputes between the appellant and the respondent. The High Court has further held that though the respondent had nominated its arbitrator, since the appellant had failed to do so in spite of notice, the appellant lost its right to nominate its own arbitrator. For this reason, it is the High Court which has appointed/nominated an arbitrator for the appellant with direction that two arbitrators may appoint presiding arbitrator.

16. While narrating the aforesaid events, we have also commented on the effects of the three supplementary agreements and impact thereof on Clause 25. It is too obvious, from the reading of the relevant clause in the supplementary agreements, that there could not have been any arbitration between the appellant and respondent, at this stage. Clause 25 of the original agreement has undergone material change. The modalities of raising arbitration are completely novated. As per the modified understanding between the parties, which is so eloquently recorded in writing, in the first instance, the claims of the respondent are to be taken up by the appellant with SCOPE. For pressing those claims and in order to ensure their proper adjudication, the respondent is supposed to assist and cooperate with the appellant in pursuing the arbitration. In that sense, at this stage, the appellant and respondent are on one side who have to put up a joint fight with SCOPE. It is only after the award is rendered in the arbitration between the appellant and SCOPE and something remains, which may qualify as a dispute between the appellant and the respondent, that there can be an arbitration in respect of those disputes between these two parties. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court is not correct in holding that Clause 25 of the original agreement in unamended form holds the field. In fact, even the respondent knew fully well that said clause had been drastically altered by supplementary agreements. It is for this reason that in the prayer (a) of the application under Section 11 of the Act filed by the respondent, it has itself acknowledged this change by mentioning that arbitrator be appointed in terms of Clause 25 of the contract agreement dated 3rd March 1988 “as modified by supplementary agreements dated 31st January 1990 and 6th February 1995”. What, however, is lost sight of by the respondent in the process, is that the modification in Clause 25 did not permit the respondent to move this kind of application for appointment of arbitrator between the parties, at that stage.

17. Fully realizing the sequittor of the modified clause, Ms. Priya Kumar, learned Advocate appearing for the respondent tried to paint a different story alleging non-cooperation of the appellant. She was vociferous in her submission in depicting blameworthy conduct of the appellant in not raising the claims preferred by the respondent, with SCOPE and submitted that such a conduct of the appellant was reprehensible which could not make the respondent wait for indefinite period. She highlighted the fact that though the works were completed in the year 2002, when even the constructed complex was inaugurated and the respondent had preferred the claims with the appellant with request to take up those claims with SCOPE way back in October, 2002. But nothing has moved forward. She further submitted that till date even the arbitral tribunal has not been constituted and the respondent can not be made to suffer by waiting endlessly.

18. This argument may be convincing in so far as equities are concerned. However, merely thereby the legal position which is contractually defined between the parties by way of written agreements does not alter. It would be necessary to record here that when the High Court had passed the impugned orders, the claim had not been made with SCOPE. That may be one of the reasons for the High Court to pass the impugned order. However, the said position has undergone substantial change thereafter. Even after the filing of the Special Leave Petition against the impugned order and grant of leave in the matter, in November 2009, there have been joint meetings of the appellant and the respondent with the officials of SCOPE. Few such meetings took place in April 2012. Pursuant to those meetings, SCOPE had called upon the appellant to complete the residual work rectification so that SCOPE was in a position to settle the final bills, Thereafter in June 2012, after detailed discussion on various issues concerning the project, SCOPE asked the appellant to submit revised final bill. Accordingly, bill dated 16th June, 2012 was prepared by the appellant in consultation with the representatives of the respondent and submitted to SCOPE.

19. After the submission of the revised final bill, SCOPE has been in the process of scrutinizing the same including the claims. In this regard, several round of meetings held with SCOPE. Many of these meetings with SCOPE which were held after the submission of the revised final bill were attended by the representative of the respondent along with the appellant. In December 2013, again SCOPE called upon the appellant to hold a meeting to discuss on the pending issues.

Meanwhile the appellant L&T has been continuing to extend the Bank Guarantee which was submitted to SCOPE.

20. In such a scenario, when the final bill is almost at the stage of finalization the only aspect that can be taken care of at this stage is to hasten the process of arbitration, in case after the passing of the final bill by SCOPE, some claims of the respondent still survive.

21. Accordingly while allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the High Court, we would like to give the following directions, in order to balance the equities:

(1) It shall be ensured by the appellant that final bill is settled by SCOPE within two months from the date of receiving the copy of this order. For this purpose, this order shall be brought to the notice of SCOPE as well so that SCOPE acts swiftly for settling the bill.
(2) In case there are certain claims of the respondent which are not agreed to while passing the final bill and disputes remain, those will be taken up by the appellant with SCOPE immediately thereafter by invoking arbitration between the appellant and SCOPE as per the arbitration agreement between the appellant and SCOPE. In raising such disputes the appellant and the respondent shall act in unison as per the understanding arrived at between them vide supplementary agreements. In that event, arbitral tribunal shall be constituted within 2 months thereof.
(3) In case the appellant is satisfied with the final bill and chooses not to raise the claims with SCOPE but the respondent feels that their claims are legitimate then it would be treated as dispute between the appellant and the respondent. In that event, arbitral tribunal shall be constituted as per Clause 25 of the agreement dated 3.3.1998 between the parties within a period of two months of that event.
(4) In either of the aforesaid arbitrations, the arbitral tribunal shall endeavour to render its award within six months from the date of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.
22. The appeal is allowed and disposed of in the aforesaid terms.",0
S.V.A. Steel Re-rolling Mills Ltd,"Being aggrieved by the common Judgment dated 24th February, 2005 delivered by the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in W.P.(C) No.5795/2004, W.P.(C) No.5877/2004, W.P.(C) No.5984/2004 and O.P. No.9816/2001, the appellants, original petitioners before the High Court have approached this Court by way of these appeals.

2. The facts giving rise to the present appeals, in a nut-shell, are as under:

The appellants are businessmen having their manufacturing units in the State of Kerala and they are manufacturing different articles with the help of electricity, which is generated/supplied by the Kerala State Electricity Board (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Board’). The respondent-Government was desirous of having industrial development in the State of Kerala and therefore, it had framed certain policies so as to encourage and invite businessmen for setting up their manufacturing units in the State of Kerala. Due to shortage of electricity supply in the State of Kerala, interested entrepreneurs were not inclined to set up their units in the State of Kerala. In view of the aforestated circumstances, the State Government had laid down a policy whereby it declared to give continuous electricity supply at a particular rate to certain new manufacturing units.

3. So as to put the aforestated policy in practice, the respondent-State had issued a Government Order dated 21st May, 1990 which read as under:

“Government have been considering the question of giving some incentives to new industries in the matter of power connection. Taking into consideration the announcements made by the Minister (Finance) in the current year’s budget speech and after discussions with all concerned, Government are now pleased to issue the following orders in this context which will have effect from 1-4-1990.

1. Power connection will be given on completion of any project irrespective of whether a general power cut is in force or not.

2. New units commencing industrial production will be exempted from power cut for a period of 5 years from the date of commercial production.

3. Exemption from payment of electricity duty for a period of 5 years from the date of commencement of commercial production will be given to the new units.

4. In future the electricity duty will not be collected from the industries if they are eligible for exemption.

5. Service connection charges will not be levied if no extension is required or if the additional line to be provided is less than 500 meters in length.” The aforestated State Government Order had been adopted by the Board by its Order dated 19th June, 1990.

4. By virtue of the aforestated policy declared under the order dated 21st May, 1990, the respondent-State had assured the manufacturing units to be set up in the State of Kerala that electricity connection would be given to the projects which might be set up and they would be exempted from power cut for a period of 5 years from the date of commencement of commercial production. Such new units were also given certain exemption in relation to payment of electricity duty for a period of five years.

5. It is not in dispute that in pursuance of the aforestated policy the appellants had established their manufacturing units (hereinafter referred to as ‘the new units’) in the respondent-State. It is also not in dispute that the requisite conditions, which had been imposed upon such new units, had been fully complied with by the appellants and therefore, the appellants were entitled to an uninterrupted electricity supply for a period of 5 years from the date on which they had commenced their commercial production.

6. The respondent-State had thereafter passed a further order on 6th February, 1992, whereby the new units were exempted for 5 years from the payment of enhanced power tariff on certain conditions. According to the appellants, they were also entitled to benefit under the aforestated G.O. dated 6th February, 1992.

7. In spite of the assurance given by the respondent-State to the new units that they would not suffer any power cut, because of certain difficulties faced by the Board with regard to supply of electricity to new units, there used to be power cuts which adversely affected the new units. In view of the said fact, to alleviate the difficulties of the units set up under the aforestated policy, the respondent-State passed further order on 26th October, 1999, whereby it granted extension of period of assured power supply to the new units, who were adversely affected because of the power cut in certain circumstances. Under the aforestated order, it was decided and declared to extend the benefit which had been given under G.O. dated 25th May, 1990 and 6th February, 1992 to the new units by number of days during which supply of electricity to them had been cut to the extent of 50% or more. The respondent-State also decided to reimburse the Board with the amount of benefit which was given to the new units on account of power cut beyond 50%.

8. In the aforestated admitted facts and circumstances, the respondent-

State should have given the benefits which had been assured to the new units but for the reasons beyond control of the State as well as the Board, the benefits assured to the new units could not be given and therefore, along with other industrial units, the present appellants had filed writ petitions before the High Court of Kerala praying that the benefits which had been assured to them should be given and they should not be constrained to pay tariff at the enhanced rate.
9. Thus, according to the appellants, in fact, they did not get real benefit of the policy because their production was adversely affected whenever there was power cut and the five years’ period of exemption from power cut was not extended by the Government which was in violation of the promise given to the appellants and other similarly situated new units.

10. All these grievances were ventilated before the High Court by filing different petitions which were ultimately rejected by the High Court by virtue of the impugned order.

11. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants had vehemently submitted that it was unfair on the part of the respondent -State not to adhere to the promise given to the appellants with regard to uninterrupted 100% electricity supply. The appellants had set up their industries in the State of Kerala because of the promise given by the respondent-State that at least for a period of first 5 years from the date of commencement of the commercial production, there would be uninterrupted power supply and there would not be any increase in the tariff and therefore, the respondent-State was bound by the said policy. The principle of promissory estoppel was also invoked by the appellants.

12. The learned counsel had further submitted that if for some reason it was not possible for the respondent- State to give uninterrupted 100% electricity supply to the appellants on a particular day, the said period or the said day should have been added to the period of 5 years for which the respondent-State had promised uninterrupted 100% electricity supply to the new units. According to the learned counsel, though, the period had been extended, but not in a fair and reasonable manner because the days during which there was cut of electricity supply to the extent of 50% or more, were added to the period of 5 years. According to the learned counsel, whenever there was any reduction in power supply, even if the reduction or cut was 50% or less, the said period should have been added to the period of 5 years, for the reason that in case of continuing process industries, for proper functioning of the manufacturing units, uninterrupted 100% supply of electricity is a sine qua non.

13. The learned counsel had shown us some material whereby it was shown that out of first 5 years during which the appellants were to be given benefit, there was electricity cut for 921 days and out of those 921 days there were 214 days when the cut in electricity supply was for more than 50%. It had been further submitted that the period during which even the electricity cut was less than 50%, the new units could not work at its optimum level, which had resulted into several problems for the appellants.

14. He had further added that the respondent Board had accepted the policy of the State with regard to giving benefit to the new units for uninterrupted power supply on same tariff and therefore, the Board could not have asked for additional tariff during the period of 5 years, as extended by the period during which there was power cut.

15. The learned counsel had also alleged that the respondent- State had given discriminatory treatment to the appellants by not giving uninterrupted 100% electricity supply because the State had given uninterrupted 100% electricity supply to certain other manufacturing units like Malabar Cement and the industries set up within the Export Processing Zone. It had been asserted that if the above stated manufacturing units could be given 100% uninterrupted electricity supply, there was no reason for denying the same benefit to the appellants.

16. So as to substantiate the submission with regard to promissory estoppel, the learned counsel had relied upon certain judgments delivered by this Court.

17. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent -State had submitted that the prayers made by the appellants before the High Court were unjust and therefore, their petitions and other petitions, praying for similar relief had rightly been rejected by the impugned order of the High Court.

18. It had been also submitted that Section 22 B of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) enables the respondent-State to impose control on distribution and consumption of energy. Section 22 B of the Act reads as under:

“Sector 22B. (1) Power to control the distribution and consumption of energy:- If the State Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do, for maintaining the supply and securing the equitable distribution of energy, it may by order provide for regulating the supply, distribution, consumption or use thereof.”

19. The aforestated provision, according to the learned counsel, enables the respondent-State to regulate the supply, distribution or consumption of electricity and as there was shortage of electricity supply, the respondent-State had to impose some electricity cut, so as to see that least problems were created to the residents and industrial units set up in the respondent-State. The Government authorities had to use their discretion in the matter of supply of electricity. The discretion which the respondent-State used was quite reasonable as it was not possible to give 100% electricity supply to all the consumers of electricity in the State. In the aforestated circumstances, the respondent- State had to regulate the supply by imposing some power cut, and unfortunately it resulted into some difficulties to the appellants.

20. It had been further submitted by the learned counsel that, so as to reduce the difficulties of the appellants, the Government had issued an order whereby the days, during which electricity supply was cut beyond 50%, had been added to the period of 5 years during which the appellants were entitled to the concession declared by the State of Kerala. Thus, sufficient efforts were made to see that the benefits assured to the appellants were provided.

21. It had been further submitted that the appellants cannot expect benefit of extension of period simply because there was negligible cut in the supply for very less period. Therefore, the respondent- State had decided that as and when the cut was 50% or more, the period for which such the cut had been effected would be added to the period of 5 years and the said decision was just and fair.

22. The learned counsel had also submitted that all consumers of electricity, including the appellants were informed well in advance about the stoppage of electricity supply and thus, all possible efforts were made to see that the appellants and other similarly situated consumers were not put to much hardship.

23. The learned counsel had further submitted that looking at the facts of the case, there would not be any promissory estoppel as submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants. The learned counsel had relied upon the judgments delivered in the case of State of Haryana & Ors. v. Mahabir Vegetable Oils Pvt. Ltd., [2011 (3) SCC 778] and State of Rajasthan & Anr. v. M/s Mahaveer Oil Industries & Ors., [1999(4) SCC 357] to substantiate their case to the effect that there could not be any promissory estoppel in such cases.

24. We had heard the learned counsel at length and perused the impugned judgment and the judgments referred to in the course of hearing and the relevant material placed on record of this Court. It is not in dispute that the appellants had set up their new units in the State of Kerala only upon knowing the policy with regard to uninterrupted power supply and that too at the same tariff for a period of 5 years from the date of commercial production.

25. In the instant case, no case had been made out by the respondent-

State that the appellants had committed any breach or were not entitled to any of the benefits or concessions which had been offered to them by the respondent-State. In the circumstances, the respondent-State was bound to give the benefits which had been assured to the appellants.
26. Though the respondent-State was bound to supply uninterrupted 100% electricity required by the appellants, one cannot lose sight of the fact that at times there would be circumstances which would put the respondent-State and the Board into such a difficulty that they would not be in a position to fulfill the assurance given to the new units. It is not in dispute that the State of Kerala is not generating enough electricity to cater the needs of all its consumers in the State of Kerala. The respondent-State is not having a magic wand which would enable the State to generate more electricity. There might be several factors which might be adversely affecting the respondents and as a result thereof, the respondents might not be generating sufficient electricity so as to fulfill the needs of the appellants and other residents of the State.

27. The question, thus, arises as to how the adversely affected persons who had been assured by a promise with regard to continuous supply of electricity for five years can be fairly compensated.

28. It is true that the respondent-State came out with Government Order dated 26th October, 1999, whereby it had decided that the period when there would be reduction or cut in supply of power to the extent of 50% or more, such period of power cut would be added to the period of 5 years, during which the appellants and other similarly situated persons were to be given continuous power supply.

29. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents could not show us any justifiable reason for deciding as to why the respondent-State decided to give the benefit of extended period only when the power cut was 50% or more. It is pertinent to know that the cases where the consumer is having a continuous process industry, even power cut below 50% would adversely affect the manufacturing unit. It is a matter of common knowledge that in several industries, the manufacturing process can not be stopped abruptly. Many a times, restarting of the machines or boilers take lot of time and energy, which results into loss to the manufacturer. The said fact ought to have been considered by the State while taking the aforestated decision. The decision with regard to giving extension of time to such a limited extent is not reasonable and in our opinion, that would have surely affected the new units adversely.

30. It is true that Section 22B of the Act enables the State Government to regulate the supply, distribution and consumption of electricity for the purpose of maintenance and supply of equitable distribution of energy but in our opinion, provisions of the said section are not much relevant for the reason that in the instant case, the respondent State had given an assurance with regard to uninterrupted supply of electricity and therefore, the respondents ought to have made provision for uninterrupted supply of electricity to the appellants and other similarly situated persons by regulating electricity supply in a proper manner.

31. Framing such policies and doing the needful for its implementation are administrative functions of the respondent-State and therefore, normally this Court would not like to interfere with its policies but looking at the peculiar facts of the case, where an assurance had been given for uninterrupted supply of electricity, one would presume that the respondent-State must have made necessary arrangements to provide 100% uninterrupted supply of electricity for 5 years to the new units. If for any reason it was not possible to supply electricity as assured, the respondent-State ought to have extended the period of 5 years by the period during which assured electricity was not supplied. By doing so, the respondent-State could have made an effort to fulfill its promise and satisfied the persons who had acted on an assurance given by the State and set up their manufacturing units in the State of Kerala.

32. Before laying down any policy which would give benefits to its subjects, the State must think about pros and cons of the policy and its capacity to give the benefits. Without proper appreciation of all the relevant factors, the State should not give any assurance, not only because that would be in violation of the principles of promissory estoppel but it would be unfair and immoral on the part of the State not to act as per its promise.

33. In the instant case, the respondent-State was conscious about the fact that there was a problem with regard to supply of electricity in the State of Kerala and possibly for that reason industries which depended much upon electricity as a source of power were not inclined to establish new industries in the State of Kerala. Before setting up an industry, the entrepreneur or the industrialist considers several factors and thereupon takes several decisions like place of business, capacity at which production should be made, type of raw-material, etc. After considering all these factors, a final decision is taken with regard to setting up of an industry. For a new entrepreneur, such a decision is of vital importance because if he fails in his estimates or in consideration of all the relevant factors, there are all chances that he would fail not only in his business but he would completely ruin himself. Thus, one can very well appreciate that the appellants must have thought about all relevant factors, including the incentives offered by the respondent- State and might have decided to set up their industries in the respondent-State. While deciding this case, this Court would invariably keep in mind the circumstances in which the appellants had set up their industries in the State of Kerala.

34. In view of the incentives and assurances given to the appellants along with others, who were desirous of setting up new industries, the appellants set up their new units which were much dependant upon continuous supply of electricity. One of the appellants is a Steel Re-rolling Mill. In Steel industry, when the industry is concerned with making of steel or re-rolling of steel, it requires lot of power and energy, and electricity being one of the important sources of power, the appellant was much dependent on continuous supply of electricity, which had been assured to it by the respondent-State.

35. If an assurance was given to the appellants and similarly situated persons that they would be given 100% electricity supply for five years, the respondents can not riggle out of their liability by making a policy to the effect that the benefit by way of incentive would be extended only if the electricity supply was reduced to less than 50% on a particular day. A steel industry, for example, which cannot function without electricity or power in any other form, would be put to enormous inconvenience and loss if the power supply is not continuous. So as to reactivate or to restart the machines or to start the process afresh, the industry has to spend something more then what it would have spent if the supply or power namely, electricity was uninterrupted. Stoppage of manufacturing process would mean losses under several heads. The labour employed has to be paid even when the employer does not get work from the labour force. Very often, so as to bring a required temperature for the purpose of carrying on certain processes, more fuel is to be injected so as to attain the condition which was prevailing prior to electricity supply being disconnected. Moreover, there would be several overhead expenses which one has to incur even if there is no production or stoppage of manufacturing process.

36. The judgments cited by the counsel appearing for the respondents would not help them for the reason that in the cases referred to, the Government had to change the policy in public interest. In the instant case, by compensating the aggrieved appellants, no harm would be caused to the State of Kerala except that it will have to compensate the appellants by supplying assured electricity for some extended period at a specified tariff.

37. For the aforestated reasons, in our opinion, the respondent-State was not wholly fair when it extended benefit to the appellants only for the period during which electricity supply was reduced to less than 50% on certain days.

38. We, therefore, hold that the benefit extended by the respondent State is not sufficient. The respondent-State ought to have extended the period even for the days when supply of electricity was more than 50% but not 100% as assured under G.O. dated 21.5.1990 and 6.2.1992. We, therefore, direct the respondents to give the said benefit by extending the period of incentive.

39. We, therefore, allow the appeals by quashing and setting aside the impugned order passed by the High Court and direct the respondents to calculate the period during which 100% electricity supply was not given to the appellants and extend the period of incentive accordingly. The calculation shall be made and consequential orders shall be passed within two months from today. The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.",1
Syed Gulzar Hussain & Others,"We are, in these cases, primarily concerned with the resolution of a dispute between the Dewan Sajjadanashin and Khadims of the Holy Shrine of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer with regard to the sharing of Nazrana offered by the pilgrims visiting the Holy Shrine. Petitioners submit that the High Court, while deciding the above issue, practically framed a Scheme for the implementation of the final decree dated 3.5.1933 (as amended on 29.1.1940) in Civil Suit No. 9 of 1929 passed by the Additional District Judge, Ajmer-Merwana, Ajmer which, according to the petitioners, was not warranted and beyond the scope of the decree.

2. Petitioners, who claim to represent the entire group of Khadims, it is seen from the order impugned, themselves wanted the Court to make some suitable and permanent arrangement for the purpose of implementing the decree. Due to the long standing disputes between these two factions with regard to sharing of Nazrana, in fact, a proposal was mooted to appoint a Receiver, which the Executing Court as well as the High Court felt, it would not be in the best interest of all concerned and thought of making some interim arrangement with the junction of Durgah Committee, a body constituted under Section 4 of the Dargah Khwaja Saheb Act, 1955. The powers and duties of the Durgah Committee have been enunciated in Section 11 of the Act. The functions and duties of Khadims also find a place in the bye-law no. 13 framed vide notification dated 16.10.1958 by the Committee in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 20 of the Act.

3. The Durgah of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti, as already indicated, is a holy Shrine where, every day, a large number of pilgrims/visitors from the country and outside, visit and offer their prayers and pay donations in the form of cash, kabarposh, implements, animals etc. at different places of Durgah for various religious purposes. Every day, certain rituals are also performed by Khadims within the Dome of the Shrine at the beginning, to the end and during the course of the day. The decree passed in Civil Suit No. 9 of 1929 also recognizes the rights of Dewan in respect of offerings made at the Durgah, the details of which have elaborately been dealt with in the impugned order itself and hence not repeated. The history of the Holy Shrine as well as the rights of the Durgah Committee, Khadims and Dewan have also been dealt with by this Court in Durgah Committee, Ajmer and Another v. Syed Hussain Ali and Others AIR 1961 SC 1402. Noticing the various directions contained in the decree, as well as the judgment of this Court and also taking note of the request of the Khadims themselves, the High Court thought of making some suitable arrangements for the purpose of implementing the decree. The following are the directions given by the High Court:

i) As regards the adjudication of the rights contained in para A(ii), it is directed that the Nazim on behalf of Durgah Committee shall take the custody of the offerings or presents of gold or silver vessels or implements or kabarposhes that may be offered by the visitors/pilgrims for the use of Durgah. The Nazim or his representative shall remain present inside the dome of the shrine to collect such offerings and presents. In case, the Khadims/judgment debtors receive such offerings or presents from the visitors/pilgrims, they shall deposit the same in the office of the Nazim at the end of the day. It is needless to say that the office of the Nazim shall maintain regular accounts/records of such offerings/presents, and keep in safe custody till any decision is taken by the Durgah Committee for their disposal/use;
ii) As regards the declaration of rights contained in para A(iii) and (iv), it is directed that there shall be kept iron boxes for donations, big and sufficient in number, at different places inside and outside the dome of the shrine, more particularly at the pit near the grave inside the dome, to enable the visitors/pilgrims to put their cash/valuable offerings in such boxes. Such boxes shall have the locks and the keys thereof would be kept in the custody of the Nazim;
iii) The Nazim shall hand over all the offerings deposited in such boxes kept outside the dome of the shrine to the Khadims as their perquisites. However, the offerings of animals or such bulky articles made at the steps of the shrine shall be divided by the Nazim between the Dewan and the Khadim respectively in equal shares, at the end of the day. The Nazim in consultation with the Durgah Committee shall make necessary arrangement for collection of such bulky articles at the gates/entrances of the shrine and Durgah;
iv) So far as the offerings deposited in the donation boxes kept inside the dome of the shrine are concerned, the Nazim, at the end of the day, shall maintain accounts and divide such offerings between the Dewan and the Khadims respectively in equal shares, irrespective of the spot at which they were deposited within the dome. Nazim may distribute such offerings on daily/weekly/ monthly basis after keeping proper accounts, in presence of the representatives of the Khadims and the Dewan. However, the Nazim shall hand over to the Khadims, the offerings of all coins not exceeding two annas in value irrespective of whether they are made of copper or any other metal and cowries and gold or silver articles (other than coins), of a value less than 8 annas and cotton cloth of inferior quality, and all offerings made between the hours of 4 A.M. to 4 P.M. on the last day of the Urs, as directed in the para A(iv) of the said decree;
v) It is directed that the Nazim shall treat the cash or other offerings sent by post as the offerings made at the shrine i.e. within the dome, unless addressed specially to the Durgah Committee, the Dewan or the Khadims for their exclusive use, as directed in Para A(v) of the said decree;
vi) It is further directed that the Khadims, their agents or servants shall not cause any obstruction either to the Nazim or his representative, or the judgment creditor, the Dewan or his representative, or any Member of the Durgah Committee to enter and sit inside/outside the dome of the shrine or the precincts of the Durgah, and shall cooperate the Nazim in implementing the directions given by this Court;
vii) The Nazim shall display notice boards in Hindi, English and Urdu languages, at all gates of Durgah and at all visible and conspicuous places inside and outside the dome of the shrine, giving instructions to the visitors/pilgrims to put cash/valuable offerings in the donation boxes only and deposit their other offerings like kabarposhes, gold/silver articles, implements, animals at the office of Nazim only.
viii) It is clarified that the Khadims – judgment debtors and the Dewan – the judgment creditor shall be at liberty to keep their duly authorized representatives, present on their behalf at the time when the donation boxes are opened, and their shares are divided by the Nazim. The Nazim also shall be at liberty to nominate any other person as his representative, with the consultation of the Members of the Durgah Committee for the purpose of carrying out these directions, in case of his inability to remain present on any particular day.
ix) The Nazim shall be at liberty to approach this Court in case of any difficulty found in implementing the above stated directions;
x) The Nazim shall be also at liberty to take help of the staff members and in case of need, help of police.”
4. Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, submitted that the petitioners have no serious objection with regard to direction nos. (i), (v) and (vi), but raised some objections with regard to direction nos. (ii), (iii), (iv) (vii) and (viii).

5. Shri F. S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the Dewan, submitted that the direction given by the High Court is an equitable one taking care of the interest of Khadims as well as Dewan and calls for no interference at this stage.

6. Shri Guru Krishnakumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the Durgah Committee, also took the same stand and submitted that the directions have been issued taking note of the interest of Khadims, Dewan as well as the overall interest of the pilgrims who visit the Holy Shrine.

7. We are of the view that, in a situation like this, the Court will have to take note of the overall interests of the Khadims, Dewan and Durgah Committee, with the pilgrims at its central stage. All the Khadims, Dewan and Durgah Committee, have got moral and legal obligation to account for the offerings made at the Holy Shrine, whether it is inside or outside the dome. The Holy Durgah at Ajmer is one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the Muslims of India and persons following other religions also hold the saint in great veneration and a large number of non-Muslims visit the Durgah every year from the country as well as outside. The main objection raised by the petitioners is that some of the directions given by the High Court are not workable in the sense, if the donations due to the Khadims are put in boxes, then it would not be possible for the Khadims to find out, to which Khadim the pilgrims have given a particular amount by way of donation for doing special offerings on their behalf. Further, it was pointed out that it is a customary practice that the pilgrims directly handover the amount in the hands of the Khadims, which the Khadims would share with Dewan, for which, it was stated by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, that they will keep separate accounts and, if necessary, in the presence of the Durgah Committee.

8. We may indicate that a pilgrim who goes to the Durgah and make donation, may be totally unaware as to how the donation is being divided between Khadims and Dewan. Normally, a pilgrim who makes an offering or makes any donation, expects the same to go to the Holy Shrine and its development and maintenance, not for the individual benefit of either the Khadim or Dewan. A pilgrim may give some amount directly either to Dewan or Khadim for his satisfaction if they are offering a special prayer on his behalf, which is altogether a different aspect. Necessity of proper accounting and transparency in the entire functioning of Durgah is highly necessary in the larger public interest with regard to entire amount received at the Shrine, whether it is inside or outside the dome or even the amount directly paid to the Khadims at the Shrine. Khadims, it is stated, have to share also with the Dewan the amounts they get, hence there is a necessity of the intervention of the Durgah Committee for the smooth and effective functioning of the Shrine, or else, constant disputes may crop up between both the groups, which is not in the best interest of the Holy Shrine.

9. In such circumstances, at this stage, we do not propose to make any modification in the directions already given by the High Court. Let the directions given by the High Court be given effect to, pending final adjudication of these cases and the modifications, if any, required can be examined later when the matter is finally adjudicated. The status-quo order passed by this Court is accordingly vacated.",0
