Appellant,Text,Judgement,
Vodafone International Holdings B.V.,"1. Leave granted.

Introduction

2. This matter concerns a tax dispute involving the Vodafone Group with the Indian Tax Authorities [hereinafter referred to for short as ""the Revenue""], in relation to the acquisition by Vodafone International Holdings BV [for short ""VIH""], a company resident for tax purposes in the Netherlands, of the entire share capital of CGP Investments  (Holdings) Ltd. [for short ""CGP""], a company resident for tax purposes in the Cayman Islands [""CI"" for short] vide transaction dated 11.02.2007, whose stated aim, according to the Revenue, was ""acquisition of 67% controlling interest in HEL"", being a company resident for tax purposes in India which is disputed by the appellant saying that VIH agreed to acquire companies which in turn controlled a 67% interest, but not controlling interest, in Hutchison Essar Limited (""HEL"" for short). According to the appellant, CGP held indirectly through other companies 52% shareholding interest in HEL as well as Options to acquire a further 15% shareholding interest in HEL, subject to relaxation of FDI Norms. In short, the Revenue seeks to tax the capital gains arising from the sale of the share capital of CGP on the basis that CGP, whilst not a tax resident in India, holds the underlying Indian assets.

Facts A. Evolution of the Hutchison structure and the Transaction

3. The Hutchison Group, Hong Kong (HK) first invested into the telecom business in India in 1992 when the said  Group invested in an Indian joint venture vehicle by the name Hutchison Max Telecom Limited (HMTL) - later renamed as HEL.

4. On 12.01.1998, CGP stood incorporated in Cayman Islands, with limited liability, as an ""exempted company"", its sole shareholder being Hutchison Telecommunications Limited, Hong Kong [""HTL"" for short], which in September, 2004 stood transferred to HTI (BVI) Holdings Limited [""HTIHL (BVI)"" for short] vide Board Resolution dated 17.09.2004. HTIHL (BVI) was the buyer of the CGP Share.

HTIHL (BVI) was a wholly owned subsidiary (indirect) of Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited (CI) [""HTIL"" for short].

5. In March, 2004, HTIL stood incorporated and listed on Hong Kong and New York Stock Exchanges in September, 2004.

6. In February, 2005, consolidation of HMTL (later on HEL) got effected. Consequently, all operating companies below HEL got held by one holding company, i.e., HMTL/HEL. This was with the approval of RBI and FIPB.

The ownership of the said holding company, i.e.,  HMTL/HEL was consolidated into the tier I companies all based in Mauritius. Telecom Investments India Private Limited [""TII"" for short], IndusInd Telecom Network Ltd.

[""ITNL"" for short] and Usha Martin Telematics Limited [""UMTL"" for short] were the other shareholders, other than Hutchison and Essar, in HMTL/HEL. They were Indian tier I companies above HMTL/HEL. The consolidation was first mooted as early as July, 2003.

7. On 28.10.2005, VIH agreed to acquire 5.61% shareholding in Bharti Televentures Ltd. (now Bharti Airtel Ltd.). On the same day, Vodafone Mauritius Limited (subsidiary of VIH) agreed to acquire 4.39% shareholding in Bharti Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. which indirectly held shares in Bharti Televentures Ltd. (now Bharti Airtel Ltd.).

8. On 3.11.2005, Press Note 5 was issued by the Government of India enhancing the FDI ceiling from 49% to 74% in telecom sector. Under this Press Note, proportionate foreign component held in any Indian company was also to be counted towards the ceiling of 74%.

9. On 1.03.2006, TII Framework and Shareholders Agreements stood executed under which the shareholding of  HEL was restructured through ""TII"", an Indian company, in which Analjit Singh (AS) and Asim Ghosh (AG), acquired shares through their Group companies, with the credit support provided by HTIL. In consideration of the credit support, parties entered into Framework Agreements under which a Call Option was given to 3 Global Services Private Limited [""GSPL"" for short], a subsidiary of HTIL, to buy from Goldspot Mercantile Company Private Limited [""Goldspot""

for short] (an AG company) and Scorpios Beverages Private Limited [""Scorpios"" for short] (an AS company) their entire shareholding in TII. Additionally, a Subscription Right was also provided allowing GSPL a right to subscribe to the shares of Centrino Trading Company Private Limited [""Centrino"" for short] and ND Callus Info Services Private Limited [""NDC"" for short]. GSPL was an Indian company under a Mauritius subsidiary of CGP which stood indirectly held by HTIL. These agreements also contained clauses which imposed restrictions to transfer downstream interests, termination rights, subject to objection from any party, etc. 
10. The shareholding of HEL again underwent a change on 7.08.2006 through execution of 2006 IDFC Framework Agreement with the Hinduja Group exiting and its shareholding being acquired by SMMS Investments Private Limited [""SMMS"" for short], an Indian company. Hereto, the investors (as described in the Framework Agreement) were prepared to invest in ITNL provided that HTIL and GSPL procured financial assistance for them and in consideration whereof GSPL would have Call Option to buy entire equity shares of SMMS. Hereto, in the Framework Agreement there were provisions imposing restrictions on Share Transfer, Change of Control etc. On 17.08.2006, a Shareholders Agreement stood executed which dealt with governance of ITNL.

11. On 22.12.2006, an Open Offer was made by Vodafone Group Plc. on behalf of Vodafone Group to Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a non-binding bid for US $11.055 bn being the enterprise value for HTIL's 67% interest in HEL.

12. On 22.12.2006, a press release was issued by HTIL in Hong Kong and New York Stock Exchanges that it had been approached by various potentially interested parties  regarding a possible sale of ""its equity interests"" (not controlling interest ) in HEL. That, till date no agreement stood entered into by HTIL with any party.

13. On 25.12.2006, an offer comes from Essar Group to purchase HTIL's 66.99% shareholding at the highest offer price received by HTIL. Essar further stated that any sale by HTIL would require its consent as it claimed to be a co-

promoter of HEL.

14. On 31.01.2007, a meeting of the Board of Directors of VIH was held approving the submission of a binding offer for 67% of HTIL's interest at 100% enterprise value of US $17.5 bn by way of acquisition by VIH of one share (which was the entire shareholding) in CGP, an indirect Cayman Islands subsidiary of HTIL. The said approval was subject to:

(i) reaching an agreement with Bharti that allowed VIH to make a bid on Hutch; and
(ii) entering into an appropriate partnership arrangement to satisfy FDI Rules in India. 
15. On 6.02.2007, HTIL calls for a binding offer from Vodafone Group for its aggregate interests in 66.98% of the issued share capital of HEL controlled by companies owned, directly or indirectly, by HTIL together with inter-related loans.

16. On 9.02.2007, Vodafone Group makes a revised offer on behalf of VIH to HTIL. The said revised offer was of US $10.708 bn for 66.98% interest [at the enterprise value of US $18.250 bn] and for US $1.084 bn loans given by the Hutch Group. The offer further confirmed that in consultation with HTIL, the consideration payable may be reduced to take account of the various amounts which would be payable directly to certain existing legal local partners in order to extinguish HTIL's previous obligations to them. The offer further confirmed that VIH had come to arrangements with HTIL's existing local partners [AG, AS and Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited (IDFC)] to maintain the local Indian shareholdings in accordance with the Indian FDI requirements. The offer also expressed VIH's willingness to offer Essar the same financial terms in HEL which stood offered to HTIL.

17. On the same day, i.e., 9.02.2007, Bharti conveys its no objection to the proposal made by Vodafone Group to purchase a direct or indirect interest in HEL from the Hutchison Group and/ or Essar Group.

18. On 10.02.2007, a re-revised offer was submitted by Vodafone valuing HEL at an enterprise value of US $18.80 bn and offering US $11.076 bn for HTIL's interest in HEL.

19. On 11.02.2007, a Tax Due Diligence Report was submitted by Ernst & Young. The relevant observation from the said Report reads as follows:

""The target structure now also includes a Cayman company, CGP Investments (Holdings) Limited, CGP Investments (Holdings) Limited was not originally within the target group. After our due diligence had commenced the seller proposed that CGP Investments (Holdings) Limited should be added to the target group and made available certain limited information about the company. Although we have reviewed this information, it is not sufficient for us to be able to comment on any tax risks associated with the company.""
20. On 11.02.2007, UBS Limited (Financial Advisors to VIH) submitted a financial report setting out the methodology for valuation of HTIL's 67% effective interest in HEL through the acquisition of 100% of CGP.

21. On 11.02.2007, VIH and HTIL entered into an Agreement for Sale and Purchase of Share and Loans (""SPA""

for short), under which HTIL agreed to procure the sale of the entire share capital of CGP which it held through HTIHL (BVI) for VIH. Further, HTIL also agreed to procure the assignment of Loans owed by CGP and Array Holdings Limited [""Array"" for short] (a 100% subsidiary of CGP) to HTI (BVI) Finance Ltd. (a direct subsidiary of HTIL). As part of its obligations, HTIL undertook to procure that each Wider Group Company would not terminate or modify any rights under any of its Framework Agreements or exercise any of their Options under any such agreement. HTIL also provided several warranties to VIH as set out in Schedule 4 to SPA which included that HTIL was the sole beneficial owner of CGP share.

22. On 11.02.2007, a Side Letter was sent by HTIL to VIH inter alia stating that out of the purchase consideration, up to US $80 million could be paid to some of its existing partners. By the said Side Letter, HTIL agreed to procure that Hutchison Telecommunications (India) Ltd. (Ms) [""HTIL Mauritius"" for short], Omega Telecom Holdings Private  Limited [""Omega"" for short] and GSPL would enter into IDFC Transaction Agreement prior to the completion of the acquisition pursuant to SPA, which completion ultimately took place on 8.05.2007.

23. On 12.02.2007, Vodafone makes public announcement to Securities and Exchange Commission [""SEC"" for short], Washington and on London Stock Exchange which contained two assertions saying that Vodafone had agreed to acquire a controlling interest in HEL via its subsidiary VIH and, second, that Vodafone had agreed to acquire companies that control a 67% interest in HEL.

24. On the same day, HTIL makes an announcement on HK Stock Exchange stating that it had agreed to sell its entire direct and indirect equity and loan interests held through subsidiaries, in HEL to VIH.

25. On 20.02.2007, VIH applied for approval to FIPB. This application was made pursuant to Press Note 1 which applied to the acquisition of an indirect interest in HEL by VIH from HTIL. It was stated that ""CGP owns directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries an aggregate of 42.34% of the issued share capital of HEL and a further indirect  interests in 9.62% of the issued share capital of HEL"".

That, the transaction would result in VIH acquiring an indirect controlling interest of 51.96% in HEL, a company competing with Bharti, hence, approval of FIPB became necessary. It is to be noted that on 20.02.2007, VIH held 5.61% stake (directly) in Bharti.

26. On the same day, i.e., 20.02.2007, in compliance of Clause 5.2 of SPA, an Offer Letter was issued by Vodafone Group Plc on behalf of VIH to Essar for purchase of its entire shareholding (33%) in HEL.

27. On 2.03.2007, AG wrote to HEL, confirming that he, through his 100% Indian companies, owned 23.97% of a joint venture company-TII, which in turn owned 19.54% of HEL and, accordingly, his indirect interest in HEL worked out to 4.68%. That, he had full and unrestricted voting rights in companies owned by him. That, he had received credit support for his investments, but primary liability was with his companies.

28. A similar letter was addressed by AS on 5.03.2007 to FIPB. It may be noted that in January, 2006, post dilution of FDI cap, HTIL had to shed its stake to comply with 26%  local shareholding guideline. Consequently, AS acquired 7.577% of HEL through his companies.

29. On 6.03.2007, Essar objects with FIPB to HTIL's proposed sale saying that HEL is a joint venture Indian company between Essar and Hutchison Group since May, 2000. That, Bharti is also an Indian company in the ""same field"" as HEL. Bharti was a direct competitor of HEL in India. According to Essar, the effect of the transaction between HTIL and VIH would be that Vodafone with an indirect controlling interest in HEL and in Bharti violated Press Note 1, particularly, absent consent from Essar.

However, vide letter dated 14.03.2007, Essar gave its consent to the sale. Accordingly, its objection stood withdrawn.

30. On 14.03.2007, FIPB wrote to HEL seeking clarification regarding a statement by HTIL before US SEC stating that HTIL Group would continue to hold an aggregate interest of 42.34% of HEL and an additional indirect interest through JVCs [TII and Omega] being non-

wholly owned subsidiaries of HTIL which held an aggregate of 19.54% of HEL, which added up to 61.88%, whereas in  the communication to FIPB dated 6.03.2007, the direct and indirect FDI held by HTIL was stated to be 51.96%.

31. By letter of the same date from HEL to FIPB, it was pointed out that HTIL was a company listed on NY SE.

Accordingly, it had to file Statements in accordance with US SEC. That, under US GAAP, HTIL had to consolidate the assets and liabilities of companies even though not majority owned or controlled by HTIL, because of a US accounting standard that required HTIL to consolidate an entity whereby HTIL had ""risk or reward"". Therefore, this accounting consolidation required that even though HTIL held no shares nor management rights still they had to be computed in the computation of the holding in terms of the Listing Norms. It is the said accounting consolidation which led to the reporting of additional 19.54% in HEL, which leads to combined holding of 61.88%. On the other hand, under Indian GAAP, the interest as of March, 2006 was 42.34% + 7.28% (rounded up to 49.62%). After the additional purchase of 2.34% from Hindujas in August 2006, the aggregate HTIL direct and indirect FDI stood at 51.96%. In short, due to the difference in the US GAAP and  the Indian GAAP the Declarations varied. The combined holding for US GAAP purposes was 61.88% whereas for Indian GAAP purposes it was 51.96%. Thus, according to HEL, the Indian GAAP number reflected the true equity ownership and control position.

32. By letter dated 9.03.2007, addressed by FIPB to HEL, several queries were raised. One of the questions FIPB had asked was ""as to which entity was entitled to appoint the directors to the Board of Directors of HEL on behalf of TIIL which owns 19.54% of HEL?"" In answer, vide letter dated 14.03.2007, HEL informed FIPB that under the Articles of HEL the directors were appointed by its shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the Indian company law.

However, in practice the directors of HEL have been appointed pro rata to their respective shareholdings which resulted in 4 directors being appointed from the Essar Group, 6 directors from HTIL Group and 2 directors from TII. In practice, the directors appointed by TII to the Board of HEL were AS and AG. One more clarification was sought by FIPB from HEL on the credit support received by AG for his investment in HEL. In answer to the said query, HEL  submitted that the credit support for AG Group in respect of 4.68% stake in HEL through the Asim Ghosh investment entities, was a standby letter of credit issued by Rabobank Hong Kong in favour of Rabo India Finance Pvt. Ltd. which in turn has made a Rupee loan facility available to Centrino, one of the companies in AG Group.

33. By letter dated 14.03.2007 addressed by VIH to FIPB, it stood confirmed that VIH's effective shareholding in HEL would be 51.96%. That, following completion of the acquisition HTIL's shares in HEL the ownership of HEL was to be as follows :

(i) VIH would own 42% direct interest in HEL through its acquisition of 100% CGP (CI).
(ii) Through CGP (CI), VIH would also own 37.25% in TII which in turn owns 19.54% in HEL and 38% (45.79%) in Omega which in turn owns 5.11% in HEL (i.e. pro-rata route).
(iii) These investments combined would give VIH a controlling interest of 52% in HEL. 
(iv) In addition, HTIL's existing Indian partners AG, AS and IDFC (i.e. SMMS), who between them held a 15% interest in HEL (i.e. option route), agreed to retain their shareholdings with full control, including voting rights and dividend rights. In other words, none of the Indian partners exited and, consequently, there was no change of control.
(v) The Essar Group would continue to own 33% of HEL.
34. On 15.03.2007, a Settlement Agreement was signed between HTIL and Essar Group. Under the said Agreement, HTIL agreed to pay US $415 mn to Essar for the following:

(a) acceptance of the SPA;
(b) for waiving rights or claims in respect of management and conduct of affairs of HEL;
(c) for giving up Right of First Refusal (RoFR), Tag Along Rights (TARs) and shareholders rights under Agreement dated 2.05.2000; and
(d) for giving up its objections before FIPB. 
35. Vide Settlement Agreement, HTIL agreed to dispose of its direct and indirect equity, loan and other interests and rights, in and related to HEL, to VIH. These other rights and interests have been enumerated in the Order of the Revenue dated 31.05.2010 as follows :

1. Right to equity interest (direct and indirect) in HEL.
2. Right to do telecom business in India
3. Right to jointly own and avail the telecom licences in India
4. Right to use the Hutch brand in India
5. Right to appoint/remove directors from the Board of HEL and its subsidiaries
6. Right to exercise control over the management and affairs of the business of HEL (Management Rights)
7. Right to take part in all the investment, management and financial decisions of HEL
8. Right over the assigned loans and advances utilized for the business in India 
9. Right of subscribing at par value in certain Indian companies
10. Right to exercise call option at the price agreed in Indian companies
11. Right to control premium
12. Right to non-compete against HTIL within the territory of India
13. Right to consultancy support in the use of Oracle license for the Indian business
14. Other intangible rights (right of customer base, goodwill etc.)
36. On 15.03.2007, a Term Sheet Agreement between VIH and Essar Teleholdings Limited, an Indian company which held 11% in HEL, and Essar Communications Limited, a Mauritius company which held 22% in HEL, was entered into for regulating the affairs of HEL and the relationship of the shareholders of HEL. In the recitals, it was stated that VIH had agreed to acquire the entire indirect shareholding of HTIL in HEL, including all rights, contractual or otherwise, to acquire directly or indirectly shares in HEL  owned by others which shares shall, for the purpose of the Term Sheet, be considered to be part of the holding acquired by VIH. The Term Sheet governed the relationship between Essar and VIH as shareholders of HEL including VIH's right as a shareholder of HEL:

(a) to nominate 8 directors out of 12 to the Board of Directors;
(b) nominee of Vodafone had to be there to constitute the quorum for the Board of Directors;
(c) to get a RoFR over the shares held by Essar in HEL;
(d) should Vodafone Group shareholder sell its shares in HEL to an outsider, Essar had a TAR in respect of Essar's shareholding in HEL.
37. On 15.03.2007, a Put Option Agreement was signed between VIH and Essar Group requiring VIH to buy from Essar Group Shareholders all the Option Shares held by them.

38. By letter dated 17.03.2007, HTIL confirmed in writing to AS that it had no beneficial, or legal or any other right in AS's TII interest or HEL interest.

39. On 19.03.2007, a letter was addressed by FIPB to VIH asking VIH to clarify as to under what circumstances VIH agreed to pay US $11.08 bn for acquiring 67% of HEL when the actual acquisition is only 51.96%. This query presupposes that even according to FIPB the actual acquisition was only 51.96% (52% approx.).

40. On the same day, VIH replied that VIH has agreed to acquire from HTIL, interests in HEL which included 52% equity shareholding for US $11.08 bn. That, the price included a control premium, use and rights to the Hutch Brand in India, a non-compete agreement with the Hutch Group, the value of non-voting non-convertible preference shares, various loans obligations and the entitlement to acquire a further 15% indirect interest in HEL as set out in the letter dated 14.03.2007 addressed to FIPB (see page 6117 of SLP Vol. 26). According to the said letter dated 19.03.2007, all the above elements together equated to 67% of the economic value of HEL.

41. Vide Agreement dated 21.03.2007, VIH diluted its stake in Bharti by 5.61%.

42. In reply to the queries raised by FIPB regarding break up of valuation, VIH confirmed as follows:

Various assets and liabilities of CGP included its rights and entitlements, including subscription rights, call options to acquire in future a further 62.75% of TII, call options to acquire in future a further 54.21% of Omega which together would give a further 15.03% proportionate indirect equity ownership of HEL, control premium, use and rights to Hutch brand in India and a non-compete agreement with HTIL. No individual price was assigned to any of the above items. That, under IFRS, consolidation included TII and Omega and, consequently, the accounts under IFRS showed the total shareholding in HEL as 67% (approx.). Thus, arrangements relating to Options stood valued as assets of CGP. In global basis valuation, assets of CGP consisted of:

its downstream holdings, intangibles and arrangement relating to Options, i.e. Bundle of Rights acquired by VIH.

This reply was in the letter dated 27.03.2007 in which it was further stated that HTIL had conducted an auction for  sale of its interests in HEL in which HTIL had asked each bidder to name its price with reference to the enterprise value of HEL. As a consequence of the transaction, Vodafone will effectively step into the shoes of HTIL including all the rights in respect of its Indian investments that HTIL enjoyed. Lastly, the Indian joint venture partners would remain invested in HEL as the transaction did not involve the Indian investors selling any of their respective stakes.

43. On 5.04.2007, HEL wrote to the Joint Director of Income Tax (International Taxation) stating that HEL had no tax liabilities accruing out of the subject transaction.

44. Pursuant to the resolution passed by the Board of Directors of CGP on 30.04.2007, it was decided that on acquisition loans owed by CGP to HTI (BVI) Finance Ltd.

would be assigned to VIH; the existing Directors of CGP would resign; Erik de Rijk would become the only Director of CGP. A similar resolution was passed on the same day by the Board of Directors of Array.

45. On 7.05.2007, FIPB gave its approval to the transaction, subject to compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in India.

46. On 8.05.2007, consequent upon the Board Resolutions passed by CGP and its downstream companies, the following steps were taken:

(i) resignation of all the directors of Hutch Group;
(ii) appointment of new directors of Vodafone Group;
(iii) resolutions passed by TII, Jaykay Finholding (India) Private Limited, UMT Investments Ltd., UMTL, Omega (Indian incorporated holding companies) accepting the resignation of HTIL's nominee directors and appointing VIH's nominee directors;
        (iv)     same   steps   were   taken   by   HEL   and   its 



                 subsidiaries;



        (v)      sending of a Side Letter by HTIL to VIH relating to 



                 completion mechanics;



        (vi)     computation   of   net   amount   payable   by   VIH   to 



HTIL including retention of a certain amount out  of US $11.08 bn paid on 8.05.2007 towards expenses to operationalize the Option Agreements and adjustments for breach (if any) of warranties, etc.;
(vii) assignment of loans given by HTI (BVI) Finance Ltd. to CGP and Array in favour of VIH;

(viii) cancellation of share certificate of HTIHL (BVI) and entering the name of VIH in the Register of Members of CGP;

(ix) execution of Tax Deed of Covenant indemnifying VIH in respect of tax or transfer pricing liabilities payable by Wider Group (CGP, GSPL, Mauritius holding companies, Indian operating companies).

(x) a Business Transfer Agreement between GSPL and a subsidiary of HWP Investments Holdings (India) Ltd. (Ms) for sale of Call Centre earlier owned by GSPL;

(xi) payment of US $10.85 bn by VIH to HTIL (CI).

47. On 5.06.2007, under the Omega Agreement, it was agreed that in view of the SPA there would be a consequent change of control in HTIL Mauritius, which holds 45.79% in Omega, and that India Development Fund (""IDF"" for short), IDFC and SSKI Corporate Finance Private Limited (""SSKI""

for short) would, instead of exercising Put Option and Cashless Option under 2006 IDFC Framework Agreement, exercise the same in pursuance of Omega Agreement. That, under the Omega Agreement, GSPL waived its right to exercise the Call Option under the 2006 IDFC Framework Agreement.

48. On 6.06.2007, a Framework Agreement was entered into among IDF, IDFC, SMMS, IDFC PE, HTIL Mauritius, GSPL, Omega and VIH by which GSPL had a Call Option to buy the entire equity shares of SMMS. Consequently, on 7.06.2007, a Shareholders Agreement was executed by which the shareholding pattern of Omega changed with SMMS having 61.6% and HTIL Mauritius having 38.4%.

49. On 27.06.2007, HTIL declared a special dividend of HK $6.75 per share, on account of the gains made by sale of HTIL's entire interest in HEL.

50. On 5.07.2007, a Framework Agreement was entered into among AG, AG Mercantile Company Private Limited, Plustech Mercantile Co. (P) Ltd [""Plustech"" for short], GSPL, Nadal Trading Company Private Limited [""Nadal"" for short] and VIH. Under clause 4.4, GSPL had an unconditional right to purchase all shares of AG in AG Mercantile Company Pvt. Ltd. at any time and in consideration for such call option, GSPL agreed to pay to AG an amount of US $6.3 mn annually.

51. On the same day, i.e., 5.07.2007, a Framework Agreement was entered into among AS, his wife, Scorpios, MVH, GSPL, NDC and VIH. Under clause 4.4 GSPL had an unconditional right to purchase all shares of AS and his wife held in Scorpios at any time and in consideration for the call option GSPL agreed to pay AS and his wife an amount of US$ 10.2 mn per annum.

52. On 5.07.2007, TII Shareholders Agreement was entered into among Nadal, NDC, CGP India Investments Limited [""CGP India"" for short], TII and VIH to regulate the affairs of TII. Under clause 3.1, NDC had 38.78% shareholding in TII, CGP India had 37.85% and Nadal had 23.57%.

53. It is not necessary to go into the earlier round of litigation. Suffice it to state that on 31.05.2010, an Order was passed by the Department under Sections 201(1) and 201(1A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [""the Act"" for short] declaring that Indian Tax Authorities had jurisdiction to tax the transaction against which VIH filed Writ Petition No. 1325 of 2010 before the Bombay High Court which was dismissed on 8.09.2010 vide the impugned judgment [reported in 329 ITR 126], hence, this Civil Appeal.

B. Ownership Structure

54. In order to understand the above issue, we reproduce below the Ownership Structure Chart as on 11.02.2007.

The Chart speaks for itself.

55. To sum up, CGP held 42.34% in HEL through 100% wholly owned subsidiaries [Mauritius companies], 9.62% indirectly through TII and Omega [i.e. pro rata route], and 15.03% through GSPL route.

56. To explain the GSPL route briefly, it may be mentioned that on 11.02.2007 AG Group of companies held 23.97% in TII, AS Group of companies held 38.78% in TII whereas SMMS held 54.21% in Omega. Consequently, holding of AG in HEL through TII stood at 4.68% whereas holding of AS in HEL through TII stood at 7.577% and holding of SMMS in HEL through Omega stood at 2.77%, which adds up to 15.03% in HEL. These holdings of AG, AS and SMMS came under the Option Route. In this connection, it may be mentioned that GSPL is an Indian company indirectly owned by CGP. It held Call Options and Subscription Options to be exercised in future under circumstances spelt out in TII and IDFC Framework Agreements (keeping in mind the sectoral cap of 74%).

Correctness of Azadi Bachao case - Re: Tax Avoidance/Evasion

57. Before us, it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan (2004) 10 SCC 1 needs to be overruled insofar as it departs from McDowell and Co. Ltd. v. CTO (1985) 3 SCC 230 principle for the following : i) Para 46 of McDowell judgment has been missed which reads as under: ""on this aspect Chinnappa Reddy, J. has proposed a separate opinion with which we agree"". [i.e. Westminster principle is dead].

ii) That, Azadi Bachao failed to read paras 41-45 and 46 of McDowell in entirety. If so read, the only conclusion one could draw is that four learned judges speaking through Misra, J. agreed with the observations of Chinnappa Reddy, J. as to how in certain circumstances tax avoidance should be brought within the tax net. iii) That, subsequent to McDowell, another matter came before the Constitution Bench of five Judges in Mathuram Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1999) 8 SCC 667, in which Westminster principle was quoted which has not been noticed by Azadi Bachao.

Our Analysis

58. Before coming to Indo-Mauritius DTAA, we need to clear the doubts raised on behalf of the Revenue regarding the correctness of Azadi Bachao (supra) for the simple reason that certain tests laid down in the judgments of the English Courts subsequent to The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. His Grace the Duke of Westminster 1935 All E.R. 259 and W.T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1981) 1 All E.R. 865 help us to understand the scope of Indo-Mauritius DTAA. It needs to be clarified, that, McDowell dealt with two aspects. First, regarding validity of the Circular(s) issued by CBDT concerning Indo-Mauritius DTAA. Second, on concept of tax avoidance/evasion. Before us, arguments were advanced on behalf of the Revenue only regarding the second aspect.

59. The Westminster principle states that, ""given that a document or transaction is genuine, the court cannot go behind it to some supposed underlying substance"". The said principle has been reiterated in subsequent English Courts Judgments as ""the cardinal principle"".

60. Ramsay was a case of sale-lease back transaction in which gain was sought to be counteracted, so as to avoid tax, by establishing an allowable loss. The method chosen was to buy from a company a readymade scheme, whose object was to create a neutral situation. The decreasing asset was to be sold so as to create an artificial loss and the increasing asset was to yield a gain which would be exempt from tax. The Crown challenged the whole scheme saying that it was an artificial scheme and, therefore, fiscally in-

effective. It was held that Westminster did not compel the court to look at a document or a transaction, isolated from the context to which it properly belonged. It is the task of the Court to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction and while doing so it has to look at the entire transaction as a whole and not to adopt a dissecting approach. In the present case, the Revenue has adopted a dissecting approach at the Department level.

61. Ramsay did not discard Westminster but read it in the proper context by which ""device"" which was colourable in nature had to be ignored as fiscal nullity. Thus, Ramsay lays down the principle of statutory interpretation  rather than an over-arching anti-avoidance doctrine imposed upon tax laws.

62. Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson (1984) 1 All E.R. 530 dealt with the case of interpositioning of a company to evade tax. On facts, it was held that the inserted step had no business purpose, except deferment of tax although it had a business effect. Dawson went beyond Ramsay. It reconstructed the transaction not on some fancied principle that anything done to defer the tax be ignored but on the premise that the inserted transaction did not constitute ""disposal"" under the relevant Finance Act.

Thus, Dawson is an extension of Ramsay principle.

63. After Dawson, which empowered the Revenue to restructure the transaction in certain circumstances, the Revenue started rejecting every case of strategic investment/tax planning undertaken years before the event saying that the insertion of the entity was effected with the sole intention of tax avoidance. In Craven (Inspector of Taxes) v. White (Stephen) (1988) 3 All. E.R. 495 it was held that the Revenue cannot start with the question as to whether the transaction was a tax deferment/saving device  but that the Revenue should apply the look at test to ascertain its true legal nature. It observed that genuine strategic planning had not been abandoned.

64. The majority judgment in McDowell held that ""tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of law"" (para 45). In the latter part of para 45, it held that ""colourable device cannot be a part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage the belief that it is honourable to avoid payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods"". It is the obligation of every citizen to pay the taxes without resorting to subterfuges. The above observations should be read with para 46 where the majority holds ""on this aspect one of us, Chinnappa Reddy, J. has proposed a separate opinion with which we agree"". The words ""this aspect""

express the majority's agreement with the judgment of Reddy, J. only in relation to tax evasion through the use of colourable devices and by resorting to dubious methods and subterfuges. Thus, it cannot be said that all tax planning is illegal/illegitimate/impermissible. Moreover, Reddy, J.

himself says that he agrees with the majority. In the judgment of Reddy, J. there are repeated references to  schemes and devices in contradistinction to ""legitimate avoidance of tax liability"" (paras 7-10, 17 & 18). In our view, although Chinnappa Reddy, J. makes a number of observations regarding the need to depart from the ""Westminster"" and tax avoidance - these are clearly only in the context of artificial and colourable devices. Reading McDowell, in the manner indicated hereinabove, in cases of treaty shopping and/or tax avoidance, there is no conflict between McDowell and Azadi Bachao or between McDowell and Mathuram Agrawal",0,

1. Leave granted in SLP (C) Nos.32750 of 2009 and 35350 of 2009.

2. Appellant - M/s. National Seeds Corporation Ltd. (NSCL) is a Government of India company. Its main functions are to arrange for production of quality seeds of different varieties in the farms of registered growers and supply the same to the farmers. The respondents own lands in different districts of Andhra Pradesh and are engaged in agriculture/seed production. They filed complaints with the  allegation that they had suffered loss due to failure of the crops/less yield because the seeds sold/supplied by the appellant were defective. District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forums, Kurnool, Mehboob Nagar, Guntur, Khamman and Kakinada allowed the complaints and awarded compensation to the respondents. The appeals and the revisions filed by the appellant were dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, `the State Commission') and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission respectively.

3. The appellant has questioned the orders of the National Commission, which also implies its challenge to the orders of the State Commission and the District Forums mainly on the following grounds:

(a) the District Forums did not have the jurisdiction to entertain complaints filed by the respondents because the issues relating to the quality of seeds are governed by the provisions contained in the  Seeds Act, 1966 (for short, `the Seeds Act') and any complaint about the sale or supply of defective seeds can be filed only under the Seeds Act and not under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short, `the Consumer Act').

(b) the District Forums could not have adjudicated upon the complaints filed by the respondents and awarded compensation to them without following the procedure prescribed under Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act.

(c) the growers of seeds, who had entered into agreements with it, are not covered by the definition of `consumer' under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Act because they had purchased the seeds for commercial purpose.

4. For the sake of convenience, we may advert to the facts leading to the passing of orders by three Consumer Forums, which have been impugned in Civil Appeal Nos. 7543 of  2004, 3499 of 2009 and 4519 of 2009. We may also mention that in their complaints the respondents had impleaded the officers of the appellant as parties but for the purpose of this judgment we shall only refer to them as the appellant.

Civil Appeal No.7543 of 2004 5.1 Respondents M. Madhusudan Reddy and K.

Rambhupal Reddy claim to have purchased 46 kg. of KBSH-1 Sunflower seeds from Area Manager of the appellant at Kurnool. They undertook cultivation by adopting the recognized modes of preparing the field and irrigation and also used the prescribed fertilizer but there was germination only in 60% seeds and the height of the plants was uneven. The germination in the remaining 40% plants was slow. Not only this, flowering did not take place simultaneously. At the request of the respondents, Area Manager of the appellant inspected their field on 19.11.1999. He is said to have agreed that there was less germination and the growth of the plants  was uneven, but declined to give any assurance for payment of compensation.

5.2 Dissatisfied with the response of the Area Manager, the respondents filed a complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Act and prayed for award of compensation of Rs.1,79,505/- towards the cost of seeds, fertilizer and pesticides and value of the lost crop with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum by alleging that they did not get the expected yield because the seeds sold by the appellant were defective.

5.3 In the reply filed on behalf of the appellant, it was pleaded that the seeds were purchased by respondent no. 1 alone and there was no evidence of joint cultivation by the respondents. The appellant denied that the seeds were defective and pleaded that respondent No. 1 did not get the expected yield because sufficient quantity of seeds had not been used for cultivation and there were no rain during the relevant period. It was also claimed that there was no  complaint from any other farmer, who had purchased the same variety of seeds.

5.4 By an order dated 1.12.1999 passed in IA No.141 of 1999, District Forum, Kurnool appointed Shri D. C. Rama Rao, retired Assistant Director of Agriculture as Commissioner and directed him to submit a report after inspecting the field of the respondents. The Commissioner conducted the inspection and submitted report dated 1.12.1999, the relevant portions of which are extracted below -

""The sunflower crop is raised under rainfed conditions. The soil is black and suitable for the Sunflower Crop. The cultivation aspects as observed is very satisfactory. The field is clean and free. The variety is said to be KBSJI the crop may be of 80 days above. Flowering is seen but it is not uniform. About 55% of the plants have flowers. About 25% of the plants have the head natured and about 10% of the plants are in the bud stage, while rest of the plants do not have flowers and there is no possibility for these plants to get flower, as they are only 3 feet height and the crop period to give flowers is over.

Presence of leaf heairyness is seen in all the items except item (3) above to a certain extent i.e., 3 to 4 %.

In all the cases I have noticed difference in Head shape i.e, a few or convex a few a flat and a few are concave.

In all the cases I have seen the heads are not uniform in size. Twenty five percent of heads which are dropping because of full maturity are bigger in size while many are of medium size.

I have noticed 0.1% of flowers with multiple heads.

There are gaps which are may be due to faulty seed or may be due to non germination of the seed.

In the heads which are flat and concave are having three rows of seed setting while in the convex heads the filling or setting of seed is satisfactory.

I have also seen two different plots of sunflower grown adjacent to the plot in question and are exhibiting uniformity of the plant, in height, size and opening of flower etcetra. This is an indication of a standard seed.

Similar uniformity is lacking in the plot in question. In all the three plots, there prevailed uniform physical and climatelogical factors.

Hence the wide variation in all the aspects as explained in the earlier paras gives a scope this seed is not standard up to the mark.

Particularly Hybrid seed be having with such a wide variation is not ideal.

From this I estimate the yield may be around 150 to 200 kgs/Ac as against the 600 to 700 kgs/Ac expected from the variety.""

(emphasis supplied)  5.5 The appellant filed objections against the Commissioner's report and claimed that the assessment made by him was not based on any scientific method and the comparison with the adjacent field without having regard to the nature of soil, water facility etc. was unacceptable. The appellant also contested the Commissioner's observation regarding satisfactory nature of cultivation by asserting that as per Vyavasaya Panchangam of Acharya N. G. Ranga Agriculture University, Hyderabad, 10 to 12 kgs. seeds were required for one hectare but respondent No.1 had used substantially less quantity of seeds for his holding of 21.10 acres .

5.6 The respondents filed their affidavits along with copies of Invoice bill H.No.000691 dated 11.6.1999, No.3 Adangal, letter dated 6.11.1999 given to the appellant, bill dated 29.6.1999 showing the purchase of fertilizers from Chaitanya Chemicals & Fertilizers, Kurnool and the photographs showing the unevenness in the plants. On behalf  of the appellant, an affidavit was filed along with copies of the documents mentioned therein.

5.7 The District Forum rejected the appellant's objection to the Commissioner's report and held that the complainants (the respondents herein) have succeeded in proving that the seeds sold to them were defective resulting in loss of crop. Accordingly, the complaint of the respondents was allowed and the appellant was directed to pay Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of crop and Rs.10,000/- towards the cost of fertilizer, pesticides, labour etc. with a stipulation that if the amount is not paid within one month, the appellant shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum.

5.8 The State Commission dismissed the appeal and held that Commissioner's report was rightly accepted by the District Forum because the appellant had not produced any evidence to controvert the findings contained therein that the respondent had taken proper steps for cultivation but did not get the expected yield due to faulty seeds.

5.9 The National Commission rejected the appellant's plea that the only remedy available to the respondents was to file a complaint under the Seeds Act, which is a special legislation vis-`-vis the Consumer Act, by observing that there is no provision in that Act for compensating a farmer whose crop may be adversely affected due to use of defective seeds sold by the appellant. The argument that the District Forum could not have decided the complaint without complying with the mandate of Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act was negatived by the National Commission and it was held that the report of the Commissioner, who was an expert in agriculture, was rightly relied upon by the District Forum for coming to the conclusion that the crop had failed due to the use of defective seeds.

Civil Appeal No.3499 of 2000 6.1 Respondent P. V. Krishna Reddy is a grower having land in Khanpur village of Manopad Mandal of Mahabubnagar District of Andhra Pradesh. He was one of the persons selected by the appellant in March 2000 for growing `bitter  gourd' seeds. The appellant entered into an agreement with the respondent and assured him that by producing seeds on its behalf he will get minimum net profit of Rs.38,000/- per acre within a span of three months. In furtherance of the terms of agreement, the appellant supplied 5 kgs. of `bitter gourd' foundation seeds to the respondent by charging Rs.1,852.50 towards cost of the seeds, inspection fee etc. The appellant also appointed a supervisor and the respondent sowed seeds under his supervision by spending a sum of Rs.22,470/- towards labour charges, fertilizers and pesticides.

In September, 2000, officials of the appellant visited the field of the respondent and others, who had entered into similar agreements, and rejected the seeds grown by them on the pretext that the same were not fit for certification.

6.2 On receipt of the inspection report prepared by the officials of the appellant, the respondent contacted the Horticulture Officer, who also inspected the field and submitted a report with the conclusion that the crop had failed because the seeds were defective. The respondent then  filed a complaint under the Consumer Act and prayed for issue of a direction to the appellant to pay compensation of Rs.1,38,322/- with interest at the rate of 18% per annum and compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- by alleging that he had suffered loss because the foundation seeds supplied by the appellant were defective.

6.3 In the reply filed on behalf of the appellant, the following objections were taken to the maintainability of the complaint:

(i) that in view of the arbitration clause contained in the agreement, the only remedy available to the respondent was to apply for arbitration and the District Forum did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.

(ii) that the respondent had entered into an agreement for commercial production of the seeds and, as such, he cannot be treated as a `consumer' within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Consumer Act.

On merits, it was pleaded that Shri M. V. Narsimha Rao, Seed Officer of NSC Kurnool had advised the respondent and other growers to remove off-types and diseased plants, which were liable to be rejected but the growers ignored his advice. It was then averred that during their visit on 8.9.2000, Shri M. V.

Narsimha Rao, Shri M. V. Sudhakar and Area Manager, NSCL, Kurnool found 7% off-types seeds which were more than the prescribed standards and, therefore, their crops were rejected.

The report of the Horticulture Officer was contested on the premise that the respondent did not get the seeds tested in any government laboratory.

6.4 District Forum, Mahabubnagar overruled the objections of the appellant by observing that the respondent had purchased the seeds for earning livelihood by self-

employment and not for any commercial purpose and that availability of remedy by way of arbitration does not operate as a bar to the entertaining of a complaint filed under the Consumer Act. The District Forum also referred to the appellant's plea that issue relating to quality of the seeds can  be determined only by getting the samples tested in a laboratory and rejected the same by making the following observations:

""The complainant purchased 5 kgs of bitter gourd seeds under Ex.A-1 and sowed the seeds in an extent of 3 acres in his land. He sowed the entire seeds purchased by him. At the time of sowing, he might not have known that he had to keep back some seeds out of the seeds purchased by him as sample in the event of his approaching Forum if the seed crop was ultimately rejected by NSC. As all the seeds were sowed, he could not have taken out any seeds from the soil and produce them before the District Forum for following the procedure contemplated under Section 13(1) of C.P. Act. In those circumstances, the sample of seeds could not be sent to the appropriate Laboratory for analysis as contemplated under Section 13 of C.P. Act by the District Forum.""
(emphasis supplied) 6.5. The District Forum also opined that the appellant had failed to substantiate its assertion that the respondent had not removed off types and diseased plants despite the advice given by the Seed Officer by observing that no evidence had been produced in that regard. The District Forum finally concluded that the foundation seeds supplied to the  respondent were faulty and the appellant was liable to compensate him.
6.6 The State Commission dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant and confirmed the order passed by the District Forum. The National Commission considered the objections raised by the appellant to the maintainability of the complaint, referred to the judgments of this Court in Fair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. v. N.K. Modi (1996) 6 SCC 385, State of Karnataka v.

Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society (2003) 2 SCC 412, CCI Chambers Housing Cooperative Society Ltd. v.

Development Credit Bank Ltd. (2003) 7 SCC 233 and Indochem Electronic v. Additional Collector of Customs (2006) 3 SCC 721 and held that the complaint filed by the respondent was maintainable because the jurisdiction of the consumer forums is in addition to other remedies which may be available to him. The National Commission further held that the respondent is covered by the definition of `consumer' contained in Section 2(d) of the Consumer Act because he did not purchase the seeds for any commercial purpose. The  appellant's plea that the District Forum could not have awarded compensation to the respondents without complying with Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act was negatived by the National Commission by observing that after having used all the seeds for sowing the respondent was not in a position to provide sample for testing and the report of the Horticulture Officer was sufficient for proving that the foundation seeds supplied by the appellant were defective.

Civil Appeal No.4519 of 2009 7.1 The respondent is an agricultural labourer. He used to take the lands of other farmers on lease and cultivate the same for his livelihood. He purchased tomato seeds from the appellant in the name of the landowners. When the respondent noticed that there was no yield from the plants, he approached the appellant's Manager at Vijayawada and requested him to inspect the field and assess the damages, but the latter did not respond. He then filed a complaint for award of compensation of Rs.60,000/- with interest at the rate  of 12% per annum by alleging that he had suffered loss because the seeds sold by the appellant were defective.

7.2 The appellant controverted the claim of the respondent and pleaded that the complaint was liable to be dismissed because the District Forum was not competent to decide the issue relating to the quality of seeds. It was also pleaded that the crop had failed because while sowing the seeds the respondent did not take necessary precaution.

7.3 By an order dated 27.12.1995, District Forum, Khammam appointed Shri A. Jeevan Babu, Advocate as Commissioner to inspect the field of the respondent and estimate the loss, if any, sustained by him. The Advocate Commissioner requested the Principal, Agriculture College, Aswaraopet and Mandal Revenue Officer, Yerrupalem to depute an expert and an Administrative Officer of Peddagopavaram and Yerrupalem to assist him. The Principal deputed Shri P. Sesha Reddy, Associate Professor and the M.R.O. deputed two executive officers to assist the Advocate  Commissioner. Notice of the date of inspection was given to the appellant but no one appeared on its behalf on the appointed day. After conducting inspection with the assistance of Shri P. Sesha Reddy and other officers, the Advocate Commissioner submitted report dated 31.1.1996, the relevant portions of which are extracted below:

""The field and the tomato fruits were examined by me and the Agriculture Officer and all the persons. The petitioner was also present, who told that he purchased the tomato seeds from the opposite party/respondent as usual and transplanted the same in the month of Sep. 1995 and also manured and applied pesticides as previous. The plants were sown at a distance of 3 feets from each plant. The tomato trees were grown upto 3 to 5 feets height, but no progress in the tomato fruits. The tomato fruits are small just like small bolls. There is no saleable value in the market for the said tomato fruits. The Agrl. Associate Professor Sri P . Seshi Reddy has collected the earth in the field and also trees along with the tomato fruits for testing purpose. On enquiry the petitioner told regarding the mode of cultivation that he adopted in sowing 'Naru' applying manure and pesticides. The petitioner complainant told that he was purchasing the tomato seeds from National Seeds Corporation Ltd., Vijayawada since more than 5 years and he sustained heavy loss this year due to non- production of the tomato yield since he supply of with inferior quality of tomato seeds. I conducted Panchanama at the field to that effect on 4.1.1996.  Number of villagers gathered and they also opined that the petitioner complainant has sustained heavy loss this year. He has shown empty tomato seeds packet, which is available with him. Sri P. Sesha Reddy, Associate Professor, Agrl. College, Aswaraopet has sent a report which is being submitted herewith. He opined that the seed `Pusa Early Dwarf' supplied by, NSC, Vijayawada to the farmers of Yerrupalem and Pedergopalem villages may not be true type and crop failure to yield true type may be due to defective seed. I returned back to Khammam on 4-1-1996 at 9-30 p.m. by passengers train.""
(emphasis supplied) 7.4 The District Forum considered the material produced before it including the Commissioner's report, allowed the complaint of the respondent and directed the appellant to pay him Rs.36,200/-. The State Commission and the National Commission approved the conclusion recorded by the District Forum that the respondent had suffered loss because the seeds sold by the appellant were defective. The National Commission dealt with the appellant's plea that the District Forum had not complied with Section 13(1)(c) and that there was violation of the Andhra Pradesh Seeds (Control) Order, 1983 and held:
""It is well settled by now that under Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act' for short), the burden to prove the deficiency, if any, on the part of the respondent, is on the complainant. Section 13(1)(c) provides that where a complainant alleges a defect in the goods which cannot be determined without proper analysis or test of the goods, the District Forum shall obtain a sample of the goods from the complainant, seal it and authenticate it in the manner prescribed and refer the sample so sealed to the appropriate laboratory along with a direction to make an analysis/test, whichever may be necessary. In other words, there has to be some expert opinion to prove the fact. In the present case, Dr. P. Sesha Reddy had inspected only 9 fields, the details of which have been given by him in his Report and which have been referred to in the earlier paragraph. He did not inspect the fields of other respondents. His Report is relevant insofar as the respondents in Revision Petitions Nos. 131, 135, 136, 137, 140, 142, 143 and 150 of 2003 are concerned. Insofar as respondents in the other 12 Revision Petitions, i.e., Revision Petition Nos. 132, 133, 134,138, 139, 141, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148 and 149 of 2003 are concerned, they have failed to produce any expert opinion to show that the seeds did not germinate in their fields because the seeds supplied were defective.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner raised another objection that under the Seeds Control Order, 1983, the Divisional Officer, Seeds alone is competent to inspect and report about the causes of failure of the crop. It was submitted that Revision Petition Nos.

131, 135, 136, 137, 140, 142, 143 and 150 of 2003 are liable to be dismissed as the defects cannot be determined without analysis or tests, which the respondents in these Revision Petitions failed to get  done. We find no substance in this submission. The Seeds Control Order, 1983 issued under G.O.M.s No. 97 F&A FP(2) dated 11.02.1985 does not debar any other agency from conducting an enquiry into the causes of failure of crop other than the officers mentioned therein. In the present case, it is at the instance of the District Forum that a Report was got from a Local Commissioner through Dr. P. Sesha Reddy, the expert who inspected the fields of 8 respondents and not others.

The petitioners had not sent their representatives to the fields of the complainant/respondents in spite of their making representations to that effect.

Petitioner failed to take any step on the representations/complaints received from the respondents. The Report submitted by the Expert can certainly be taken into consideration even if there was no analysis of the seeds from a laboratory. Non-examination of the seeds from the laboratory is not fatal to the case of the complainants whose fields were inspected by Dr. P.

Sesha Reddy regarding which he gave an opinion as an expert. Nothing stopped the petitioner from sending the sample seeds for analysis to a laboratory. There is no explanation as to why it could not send the seeds for analysis.""

8. Factual matrix of other cases is substantially similar except that some of the respondents had purchased Castor seeds while others had purchased Chilli seeds. In a number of cases, the District Forums appointed Commissioner or  referred the matter to the officers of the Agriculture Department for their opinion about the quality of seeds and ordered payment of compensation by relying upon their reports.

9. We may also mention that in none of these cases, the appellant had offered to produce samples of the variety of the seeds sold/supplied to the respondents and made a prayer before the District Forum that the same may be got tested/analysed in an appropriate laboratory.

10.Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the impugned orders are liable to be set aside because the District Forums did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the respondents and the State and National Commissions committed grave error by brushing aside the appellant's objections to the maintainability of the complaints. Learned counsel emphasized that the Seeds Act is a special legislation enacted for regulating the quality of seeds and if the respondents had any grievance about the quality of the seeds then the only remedy available to them  was to either file an application under Section 10 of the Seeds Act or to approach the concerned Seed Inspectors for taking action under Section 19 read with Section 21 of that Act. They further argued that even if the complaints filed by the respondents under the Consumer Act are held to be maintainable, the finding recorded by the District Forums that the seeds sold/supplied by the appellant were defective is liable to be set aside because the procedure prescribed under Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act was not followed. Learned counsel relied upon Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and argued that in view of the arbitration clause contained in the agreements entered between the appellant and the growers, the latter could have applied for arbitration and the Consumer Forums should have non-suited them in view of Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. An ancillary argument made by the learned counsel is that the growers of seeds cannot be treated as `consumer' within the meaning of Section 2(d) because they had purchased seeds for commercial purpose.

11.Learned counsel for the respondents supported the impugned orders and argued that the District Forums did not commit any illegality by entertaining the complaints filed under the Consumer Act because the Seeds Act and the Rules framed thereunder do not contain any provision for compensating a farmer whose crop is lost or who does not get the expected yield if the seeds sold/supplied by the appellant are defective. Learned counsel submitted that the remedy available under the Consumer Act is in addition to other remedies available to a consumer and the complaints filed by the respondents under that Act cannot be held as barred merely because they could also approach the Seed Inspector for taking action under Section 19 read with Section 21 of the Seeds Act. Learned counsel further argued that the growers of seeds are covered by the definition of consumer because they had agreed to undertake cultivation of seeds on behalf of the appellant for earning livelihood. On the issue of non compliance of Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Act, learned counsel submitted that the District Forums had rightly relied upon  the reports of the Court Commissioners and other evidence for recording findings that the seeds sold/supplied by the appellant were defective. Learned counsel emphasized that the respondents had used the entire quantity of seeds purchased by them for sowing and they had not retained samples by anticipating loss of crop or less yield. Learned counsel pointed out that the Commissioners had inspected the fields of the respondents and recorded categorical findings that the farmers had suffered losses because the seeds supplied by the appellant were defective and the District Forums did not commit any illegality by relying upon their reports. Learned counsel also submitted that the appellant could have produced samples of the seeds sold/supplied to the respondents and get them tested to prove that the same were not defective, but no such step was taken by it.

12.We shall first consider the question whether the Seeds Act is a special legislation vis-`-vis the Consumer Act and the District Forums could not have entertained and decided  the complaints filed by the respondents because they could seeks redressal of their grievance regarding the quality of seeds sold by the appellant by lodging complaint with the concerned Seed Inspectors with a request for taking action under Section 19 read with Section 21 of the Seeds Act.

13.With a view to increase agricultural production in the country, the Central Government felt the necessity of regulating the quality of certain seeds to be sold for the purpose of agriculture including horticulture and for achieving that object, Parliament enacted the Seeds Act.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons enshrined in the Bill, which led to the enactment of the Seeds Act read as under:

""In the interest of increased agricultural production in the country, it is considered necessary to regulate the quality of certain seeds, such as seeds of food crops, cotton seeds, etc., to be sold for purpose of agriculture (including horticulture).

The method by which the Bill seeks to achieve this object are-

(a) Constitution of a Central Committee consisting of representatives of the Central Government and the State Government, the National Seeds Corporation and other interests, to advise  those Governments on all matters arising out of the proposed Legislation;

(b) fixing minimum standards of germination, purity and other quality factors;

(c) testing seeds for quality factors at the seed testing laboratories to be established by the Central Government and the State Governments;

(d) creating seed inspection and certification service in each State and grant of licences and certificates to dealers in seeds;

(e) compulsory labelling of seed containers to indicate the quality of seeds offered for sale, and

(f) restricting the export, import and inter-State movement of non-descript seeds.""",0,
J. Samuel and Others,"22.08.1985, the Retired Diocesan Treasurer and Property Secretary, Karimnagar, issued a publication in the paper to auction the land bearing Survey No. 43, admeasuring Ac. 3.31 gts. situated at Mission Compound, Dharmapuri Road, Jagtial and the last date to receive the tenders was fixed as 05.09.1985. On 13.09.1985, the sealed tenders were opened and Gattu Mahesh-Respondent No. 1 herein and Kotha Mohan-Respondent No. 2 herein, Managing Partners in M/s Jagath Swapna & Co. put tenders for an amount of Rs. 24,55,569/- along with a DD for an amount of Rs.2,45,556/- which is 10% of the EMD. They being the highest bidders, their tenders were accepted.

b) The contract for sale of property was entered into between the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein with Karimnagar Diocese on 27.09.1985. It was mentioned in the contract that Karimnagar Diocese agreed to receive Rs. 2,50,000/- on or before 08.11.1985 because the land under sale was under  dispute and the balance amount was to the paid by the respondents herein only after getting final dropping of the land acquisition proposal by the Municipality, Jagtial and sanction of layout by the Municipality, Jagtial. On 03.04.2003, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein issued a legal notice to Karimnagar Diocese informing that the land acquisition proceedings were dropped on 05.05.1986 and the sanction of layout by the Municipality, Jagtial was completed on 28.12.1989 and to execute and register the sale deed in their favour as per the agreement dated 27.09.1985.

c) In the absence of adequate response from Karimnagar Diocese, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed O.S. No. 9 of 2004 in the Court of II Additional District Judge, Karimnagar at Jagtial for specific performance of the contract of sale and for perpetual injunction. During the pendency of the suit, Karimnagar Diocese filed written statement pointing out the inherent defects, namely, absence of mandatory requirements of Section 16(c) of Specific Relief Act and Form 47, Appendix `A' of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. On 24.09.2010, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein filed I.A. No. 1078 of 2010 in  O.S. No. 9 of 2004 under Order VI, Rule 17 of the Code seeking amendment of the plaint to incorporate specific pleading in compliance of the above section of the Specific Relief Act and the Code on the ground that the same was missed due to typographical error. On 04.10.2010, Karimnagar Diocese filed counter affidavit resisting the application.

d) By order dated 20.10.2010, the II Additional District Judge dismissed the application for amendment filed by the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein. Aggrieved by the order, the Respondents herein approached the High Court by filing Civil Revision Petition being No. 5162 of 2010. The High Court, by impugned order dated 08.02.2011, allowed the amendment sought for by the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein.

e) Aggrieved by the said decision, the respondents have preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this Court.

4) Heard Mr. A. Subba Rao, learned counsel for the appellants and Mr. K. Swami, learned counsel for the respondents.

5) The only point for consideration in this appeal is whether the High Court is right in allowing the application filed under Order VI Rule 17 CPC for amendment of the plaint which was filed after conclusion of trial and reserving the matter for orders.

6) Based on the agreement dated 27.07.1985 which relates to sale of 3 acres and 31 gunthas of land in Survey No. 43 situate in Mission Compound, Dharmapuri Road at Jagtial for a consideration of Rs.24,55,569/-, the respondents/plaintiffs filed the said suit for specific performance. Since we have already mentioned factual details, there is no need to refer the same excepting the details relating to the petition filed under Order VI Rule 17. After filing written statement by the contesting defendants, the trial of the suit commenced and admittedly both parties adduced the evidence on their behalf and arguments on behalf of both the sides were heard and completed on 22.09.2010. On that day, the Court reserved the matter for orders. Meanwhile, on 24.09.2010, the respondents herein filed a petition praying for amendment of the plaint. In support of the said application, plaintiff No.2  has filed an affidavit stating that in para 11of the plaint he has stated about the legal notice issued on 03.04.2003 to defendant Nos. 1 to 7 for specific performance of agreement of sale dated 27.09.1985 and there was no reply for it. In para 3 of the affidavit, the deponent has stated that by type mistake, the following sentences have missed. After para 11 of the plaint, the following para 12 may be added. ""We are and has been and still is ready and willing specifically to perform the agreement of sale dated 27.09.1985 on our part of which the defendants have, had noticed. I am ready with the balance amount as per agreement of sale dated 27.09.1985. I submit the para nos. 12-18 of the plaint may be changed as 13 to 19.""

The only reason given by the plaintiffs praying for amendment and inclusion of the above averment in the plaint is ""type mistake"". It is also stated that it happened in spite of their due diligence.

7) The above claim was resisted by the appellants herein by filing detailed counter affidavit. Apart from disputing the merits of the claim of the plaintiffs, with regard to the petition under Order VI Rule 17 they specifically stated that after  passing several stages in the protracted trial, the final arguments of the plaintiff in the suit were heard on 20.09.2010. The defendants have also filed their written arguments on 22.09.2010 wherein the inherent defect of plaintiff i.e. absence of averments of mandatory requirements of Section 16(c) Explanation (ii) and Form 47 Appendix A of CPC was pointed out. Even after this, further argument was made by both the parties and the counsel for the plaintiff informed the court that no further time is required and the matter may be posted for judgment. In view of the same, the learned trial Judge posted the matter to 04.10.2010 for judgment. Only at this juncture i.e. on 24.09.2010, plaintiffs came up with the present petition seeking amendment to incorporate specific pleading in compliance with Section 16 (c) of the Specific Relief Act and Form 47 of Appendix A CPC on the ground that the same was missed due to ""type mistake"" in spite of due diligence. Though the said claim was not acceptable by the trial Court, the High Court allowed the plaintiff to amend the plaint as prayed for.

8) Before considering the acceptability or otherwise of the reasoning of the High Court, it is useful to refer Order VI Rule 17 CPC.

""17. Amendment of pleadings.- The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.
Provided that no application for amendment shall be allowed after the trial has commenced, unless the Court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial.""
The said provision was omitted by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999. Section 16 of the Amendment Act reads as under:

""16. Amendment of Order 6 - In the First Schedule, in Order 6,--
***
(iii) Rules 17 and 18 shall be omitted.""
After stiff resistance by the litigants and the members of the bar, again Order VI Rule 17 was re-introduced with proviso appended therein. As per the said proviso, no application for amendment shall be allowed after the trial has commenced.

However, there is an exception to the said rule, i.e., if the court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the  party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of the trial, such application for amendment may be allowed.

9) Before proceeding further, it is also useful to refer Section 16(c) of Specific Relief Act which reads as under:

""16. Personal bars to relief.- Specific performance of a contract cannot be enforced in favour of a person-
(a) xxx
(b) xxx
(c) who fails to aver and prove that he has performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract which are to be performed by him, other than terms the performance of which has been prevented or waived by the defendant.
Explanation.- For the purposes of clause (c),-
(i) where a contract involves the payment of money, it is not essential for the plaintiff to actually tender to the defendant or to deposit in Court any money except when so directed by the Court;
(ii) the plaintiff must aver performance of, or readiness and willingness to perform, the contract according to its true construction.""
It is clear that in a suit for specific performance of a contract, unless there is a specific averment that he has performed or has always been ready and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract, the suit filed by him is liable to be dismissed. In other words, in the absence of the above said  claim that he is always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, the decree for specific performance cannot be granted by the Court.

10) In this legal background, we have to once again recapitulate the factual details. In the case on hand, Suit O.S.

No. 9 of 2004 after prolonged trial came to an end in September, 2010. The application for amendment under Order VI Rule 17 CPC was filed on 24.09.2010 that is after the arguments were concluded on 22.09.2010 and the matter was posted for judgment on 04.10.2010. We have already mentioned that Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act contemplates that specific averments have to be made in the plaint that he has performed and has always been willing to perform the essential terms of the Act which have to be performed by him. This is an essential ingredient of Section 16(c) and the form prescribes for the due performance. The proviso inserted in Rule 17 clearly states that no amendment shall be allowed after the trial has commenced except when the court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due  diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of the trial.

11) As stated earlier, in the present case, the amendment application itself was filed only on 24.09.2010 after the arguments were completed and the matter was posted for judgment on 04.10.2010. On proper interpretation of proviso to Rule 17 of Order VI, the party has to satisfy the Court that he could not have discovered that ground which was pleaded by amendment, in spite of due diligence. No doubt, Rule 17 confers power on the court to amend the pleadings at any stage of the proceedings. However, proviso restricts that power once the trial has commenced. Unless the Court satisfies that there is a reasonable cause for allowing the amendment normally the court has to reject such request. An argument was advanced that since in the legal notice sent before filing of the suit, there is reference to readiness and willingness and the plaintiff has also led in evidence, nothing precluded the court from entertaining the said application with which we are unable to accept in the light of Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act as well as proviso to Order VI Rule 17.

The only reason stated so in the form of an affidavit is omission by ""type mistake"". Admittedly, it is not an omission to mention a word or an arithmetical number. The omission is with reference to specific plea which is mandated in terms of Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act.

12) The primary aim of the court is to try the case on its merits and ensure that the rule of justice prevails. For this the need is for the true facts of the case to be placed before the court so that the court has access to all the relevant information in coming to its decision. Therefore, at times it is required to permit parties to amend their plaints. The Court's discretion to grant permission for a party to amend his pleading lies on two conditions, firstly, no injustice must be done to the other side and secondly, the amendment must be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties. However to balance the interests of the parties in pursuit of doing justice, the proviso has been added which clearly states that: no application for amendment shall be allowed after the trial has commenced, unless the court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due  diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial.

13) Due diligence is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of relief are requested. Duly diligent efforts are a requirement for a party seeking to use the adjudicatory mechanism to attain an anticipated relief. An advocate representing someone must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made are factually accurate and sufficient. The term `Due diligence' is specifically used in the Code so as to provide a test for determining whether to exercise the discretion in situations of requested amendment after the commencement of trial.

14) A party requesting a relief stemming out of a claim is required to exercise due diligence and is a requirement which cannot be dispensed with. The term ""due diligence"" determines the scope of a party's constructive knowledge, claim and is very critical to the outcome of the suit.

15) In the given facts, there is a clear lack of `due diligence' and the mistake committed certainly does not come within the preview of a typographical error. The term typographical error  is defined as a mistake made in the printed/typed material during a printing/typing process. The term includes errors due to mechanical failure or slips of the hand or finger, but usually excludes errors of ignorance. Therefore the act of neglecting to perform an action which one has an obligation to do cannot be called as a typographical error. As a consequence the plea of typographical error cannot be entertained in this regard since the situation is of lack of due diligence wherein such amendment is impliedly barred under the Code.

16) The claim of typographical error/mistake is baseless and cannot be accepted. In fact, had the person who prepared the plaint, signed and verified the plaint showed some attention, this omission could have been noticed and rectified there itself. In such circumstances, it cannot be construed that due diligence was adhered to and in any event, omission of mandatory requirement running into 3 to 4 sentences cannot be a typographical error as claimed by the plaintiffs. All these aspects have been rightly considered and concluded by the trial court and the High Court has committed an error in accepting the explanation that it was a typographical error to  mention and it was an accidental slip. Though the counsel for the appellants have cited many decisions, on perusal, we are of the view that some of those cases have been decided prior to the insertion of Order VI Rule 17 with proviso or on the peculiar facts of that case. This Court in various decisions upheld the power that in deserving cases, the Court can allow delayed amendment by compensating the other side by awarding costs. The entire object of the amendment to Order VI Rule 17 as introduced in 2002 is to stall filing of application for amending a pleading subsequent to the commencement of trial, to avoid surprises and that the parties had sufficient knowledge of other's case. It also helps checking the delays in filing the applications. [vide Aniglase Yohannan vs. Ramlatha and Others, (2005) 7 SCC 534, Ajendraprasadji N. Pandey and Another vs. Swami Keshavprakeshdasji N.

17) In the light of the above discussion, we are in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived by the Trial Court and unable to accept the reasoning of the High Court. Accordingly, the order dated 08.02.2011 passed in Civil Revision Petition No. 5162 is set aside.

WEST U.P. SUGAR MILLS ASSOCIATION & ORS.,"Dalveer Bhandari, J.

1. The crucial issue involved in this group of matters is whether the State of Uttar Pradesh has the authority to fix the State Advised Price (for short, `SAP'), which is required to be  paid over and above the minimum price fixed by the Central Government?

2. It is submitted by the appellants that the power to regulate distribution, sale or purchase of cane under Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the `U.P. Sugarcane Act') does not include the power to fix a price. According to the appellants, this aspect has been comprehensively dealt with by the Constitution Bench judgment of this court in Ch. Tika Ramji and others etc. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others (1956) SCR 393. In this case this Court enumerated the legislative history of laws relating to sugar and sugarcane of both Centre and States. This Court came to the specific conclusion that the power reserved to the State Government to fix the minimum price of sugarcane which existed in U.P. Act 1 of 1938 was deleted from the U.P. Sugarcane Act since that power was being exercised by the Centre under Clause 3 of the Sugar and Gur Control Order, 1950. The relevant paragraphs from pages 422, 433 and 434 of the Tika Ramji's case are reproduced as under:

""... ... ...Even the power reserved to the State Government to fix minimum prices of sugarcane under Chapter V of U.P. Act I of 1938 was deleted from the impugned Act the same being exercised by the Centre under clause 3 of Sugar and Gur Control Order, 1950, issued by it in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 3 of Act XXIV of 1946. The prices fixed by the Centre were adopted by the State Government required under rule 94 was that the occupier of a factory or the purchasing agent should cause to be put up at each purchasing centre a notice showing the minimum price of cane fixed by the Government meaning thereby the Centre. The State Government also incorporated these prices which were notified by the Centre from time to time in the forms of the agreements which were to be entered between the cane growers, the cane growers cooperative societies... ... ...""

... ... ... ...

""... ... ...As we have noted above, the U.P. State Government did not at all provide for the fixation of minimum prices for sugarcane nor did it provide for the regulation of movement of sugarcane as was done by the Central Government in clauses (3) and (4) of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1955. The impugned Act did not make any provision for the same and the only provision in regard to the price of sugarcane which was to be found in the U.P.

Sugarcane Rules, 1954, was contained in Rule 94 which provided that a notice of suitable size in clear bold lines showing the minimum price of cane fixed by the Government and the rates at which the cane is being purchased by the centre was to be put up by an occupier of a factory or the purchasing agent as the case may be at each purchasing centre. The price of cane fixed by Government here only meant the price fixed by the appropriate Government which would be the Central Government, under clause 3 of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1955, because in fact  the U.P. State Government never fixed the price of sugarcane to be purchased by the factories. Even the provisions in behalf of the agreements contained in clauses 3 and 4 of the U.P. Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order, 1954, provided that the price was to be the minimum price to be notified by the Government subject to such deductions, if any, as may be notified by the Government from time to time meaning thereby the Central Government, the State Government not having made any provision in that behalf at any time whatever. ... ... ...""

3. It has been specifically held in Tika Ramji's case that there was no power to fix a price for sugarcane under the U.P.

Sugarcane Act or rules and orders made thereunder.

4. It is also submitted by the appellants that even if such a power had existed under Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane Act, even then such power would be totally repugnant to the power of the Central Government to fix the minimum price under clause 3 of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1955. This Court in Tika Ramji's case has not commented on whether such a power with the State Government would be repugnant to the Central legislation, since it found no such power with the State Government, however, the majority judgment in the later Constitution Bench judgment of 2004 in U.P. Cooperative  Cane Unions Federations v. West U.P. Sugar Mills Association and others (2004) 5 SCC 430 held as under:

""The inconsistency or repugnancy will arise if the State Government fixed a price which is lower than that fixed by the Central Government. But, if the price fixed by the State Government is higher than that fixed by the Central Government, there will be no occasion for any inconsistency or repugnancy as it is possible for both the orders to operate simultaneously and to comply with both of them. A higher price fixed by the State Government would automatically comply with the provisions of sub clause (2) of clause 3 of the 1966 Order. Therefore, any price fixed by the State Government which is higher than that fixed by the Central Government cannot lead to any kind of repugnancy.""
5. According to the appellants, the aforementioned conclusion of the U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations is contrary to Tika Ramji's case.

6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length.

We have also carefully perused and analysed both the aforementioned judgments delivered by the two Constitution Benches of this Court in Tika Ramji and U.P. Cooperative Cane Unions Federations's cases.

7. In our considered view, there is a clear conflict in the aforementioned judgments of the Constitution Benches. It  may be pertinent to mention that almost every year a spate of petitions are filed before the Allahabad High Court and thereafter before this Court on similar issues and questions of law. Therefore, in the interest of justice, it is imperative that the conflict between these judgments be resolved or decided by an authoritative judgment of a larger Bench of this Court.

8. The learned counsel for the appellants in one voice asserted that these cases be referred to a larger Bench so that at least in future the parties would have benefit of a clearer enunciation of law by an authoritative judgment of a larger Bench.

9. Following questions of law may be considered by a larger Bench of this Court:

1) Whether by virtue of Article 246 read with Entry 33 of List III to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution the field is occupied by the Central legislation and hence the Central Government has the exclusive power to fix the price of sugarcane?
2) Whether Section 16 or any other provision of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 confers any power upon the State Government to fix the price at which sugarcane can be bought or sold?

3) If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, then whether Section 16 or the said provision of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 is repugnant to Section 3(2)(c) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Clause 3 of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966? and if so, the provisions of the Central enactments will prevail over the provisions of the State enactment and the State enactment to that extent would be void under Article 254 of the Constitution of India.

4) Whether the SAP fixed by the State Government in exercise of powers under Section 16 of the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation  of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 is arbitrary, without any application of mind or rational basis and is therefore, invalid and illegal?

5) Does the State Advisory Price (for short `SAP') constitute a statutory fixation of price? If so, is it within the legislative competence for the State?

6) Whether the power to fix the price of sugarcane is without any guidelines and suffers from conferment of arbitrary and uncanalised power which is violative of Articles 14 and 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India?

10. We are conscious of the fact that ordinarily a Bench of three Judges should refer the matter to a Bench of five Judges, but, in the instant case since both the aforementioned conflicting judgments have been delivered by the Constitution Benches of five Judges of this Court and hence this controversy can be finally resolved only by a larger Bench of at least seven Judges of this Court.

11. Recently, a three-Judge Bench of this court in Mineral Area Development Authority and others v. Steel Authority of India and others (2011) 4 SCC 450 dealt with somewhat similar situation and this Court in para 2 of the said judgment observed as under:

""Before concluding, we may clarify that normally the Bench of five learned Judges in case of doubt has to invite the attention of the Chief Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing before a Bench of larger coram than the Bench whose decision has come up for consideration (see Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharashtra (2005) 2 SCC 673). However, in the present case, since prima facie there appears to be some conflict between the decision of this Court in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004) 10 SCC 201 which decision has been delivered by a Bench of five Judges of this Court and the decision delivered by a seven-Judge Bench of this Court in India Cement Ltd. v. State of T.N. (1990) 1 SCC 12, reference to the Bench of nine Judges is requested. The office is directed to place the matter on the administrative side before the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.""
12. Reference of these matters to a larger Bench is made so that the controversy which arises almost every year is settled by an authoritative judgment of a larger Bench of this Court.

13. However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases, we direct the sugar factories to pay the balance  outstanding principal amount to the cane growers or to the cooperative societies according to the SAP of the relevant crushing seasons. In other words, in all those cases where the sugar factories and other buyers have not paid the balance outstanding principal amount to the cane growers or to the cooperative societies because of the stay orders obtained by them from this Court or from the High Court, they are now directed to pay the balance outstanding principal amount according to the SAP as fixed by the State Government from time to time. All the stay orders granted by this court or by the High Court are modified/vacated in the aforesaid terms.

Let the balance outstanding principal amount be paid by the sugar factories within three months from the date of this judgment.

14. In case the balance outstanding principal amount, as directed by this Court, is not paid within three months from the date of this judgment then the sugar factories/buyers would be liable to pay interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the delayed payment to the cane growers or to the cooperative societies, as the case may be.

15. It is made clear that the payment of the balance outstanding principal amount by the sugar factories is of course without prejudice to the main submissions advanced by them (sugar factories) that the State Government lack legislative competence to impose the SAP.

16. It may be pertinent to mention that all these cases are covered by separate individual agreements where the sugar factories had undertaken to pay the SAP to the cane growers.

We are not examining the veracity of these agreements.

17. It may be relevant to note that the SAP has been continuously increasing every year. In all those cases, where for any reason, the SAP was not fixed in a particular year, then, the sugar factories/buyers would be liable to pay the balance outstanding principal amount to the cane growers at the rate of the SAP of the previous year. On consideration of all the facts and circumstances of these cases, we request Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India to refer these matters to a larger Bench, preferably to a Bench consisting of seven Judges.

18. All these Civil Appeals and other petitions are accordingly referred to a larger Bench.",0,
Alister Anthony Pareira,"R.M. LODHA, J.

On the South-North Road at the East side of Carter Road, Bandra (West), Mumbai in the early hours of November 12, 2006 between 3.45 - 4.00 a.m., a car ran into the pavement killing seven persons and causing injuries to eight persons. The appellant - Alister  Anthony Pareira - was at the wheels. He has been convicted by the High Court for the offences punishable under Sections 304 Part II, 338 and 337 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).

2. The prosecution case against the appellant is this: the repair and construction work of the Carter Road, Bandra (West) at the relevant time was being carried out by New India Construction Company. The labourers were engaged by the construction company for executing the works. The temporary sheds (huts) were put up for the residence of labourers on the pavement.

In the night of November 11, 2006 and November 12, 2006, the labourers were asleep in front of their huts on the pavement. Between 3.45 to 4.00 a.m., that night, the appellant while driving the car (corolla) bearing Registration No. MH-01-R-580 rashly and negligently with knowledge that people were asleep on footpath rammed the car over the pavement; caused death of seven persons and injuries to eight persons. At the time  of incident, the appellant was found to have consumed alcohol. A liquor bottle was recovered from the appellant's car. On his medical examination, he was found to have 0.112% w/v liquor (ethyl alcohol) in his blood. The appellant was fully familiar with the area being the resident of Carter Road.

3. The contractor--Panchanadan Paramalai Harijan (PW-2) - who had engaged the labourers and witnessed the incident reported the matter immediately to the Khar Police Station. His statement (Ex. 13) was recorded and based on that a first information report (No. 838) was registered under Section 304, 279, 336, 337, 338 and 427 IPC; Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Section 66 (1)(b) of Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949.

4. On completion of investigation, the charge sheet was submitted against the appellant by the Investigating Officer in the court of Magistrate having jurisdiction. The appellant was committed to the Court  of Sessions and was tried by 2nd Adhoc Additional Sessions Judge, Sewree, Mumbai.

5. The indictment of the appellant was on two charges. The two charges read:-

""(i) that on November 12, 2006 between 3.45 to 4.00 a.m. you have driven the car bearing No. MH-01-R-580 rashly and negligently with knowledge that people are sleeping on footpath and likely to cause death of those persons slept over footpath and thereby caused the death of seven persons who were sleeping on footpath on Carter Road and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC.
(ii) on above date, time and place you have driven the vehicle in rashly and negligent manner and thereby caused grievous injury to seven persons who were sleeping on footpath and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338 IPC.""
6. The prosecution, to prove the above charges against the appellant, tendered oral as well as documentary evidence. In all, 18 witnesses, namely, Dr. Nitin Vishnu Barve (PW-1), Panchanadan Paramalai  Harijan (PW-2), Ramchandra Chakrawarti (PW-3), Pindi Ramu (PW-4), Sriniwas Raman Pindi (PW-5), Smt. Mariamma Shingamana (PW-6), Smt. Prema Chingaram (PW-7), Jagan Singaram (PW-8), Sigamani Shankar Pani (PW-9), Mallikarjun Bajappa Motermallappa (PW-10), J.C. Cell Mendosa (PW-11), Praveen Sajjan Mohite (PW-

12), Limbaji Samadhan Ingle (PW-13), Dr. Sharad Maniklal Ruia (PW-14), Rajendra Nilkanth Sawant (PW-

15), Basraj Sanjeev Mehetri (PW-16), Meenakshi Anant Gondapatil (PW-17) and Somnath Baburam Phulsunder (PW-18) were examined. The complaint, spot panchnama along with sketch map, C.A. Reports and other documents were also proved.

7. The statement of the appellant under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for short, `the Code') was recorded. He admitted that he was driving the car no. MH-01-R-580 at the relevant time and the accident did occur but his explanation was that it happened on account of failure of engine and  mechanical defect in the car and there was no negligence or rashness on his part.

8. The 2nd Adhoc Additional Sessions Judge, Sewree, Mumbai, on April 13, 2007 convicted the appellant for the offences punishable under Sections 304A and 337 IPC. The court sentenced him to suffer simple imprisonment of six months with fine of Rs. 5 lakhs for the offence under Section 304A IPC and in default further suffer simple imprisonment of one month and simple imprisonment of 15 days for the offence under Section 337 IPC. Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

9. On April 19, 2007, the Bombay High Court took suo motu cognizance of the judgment and order dated April 13, 2007 passed by the 2nd Adhoc Additional Sessions Judge, Sewree and issued notice to the State of Maharashtra, the appellant and to the heirs of the deceased and also to the injured persons.

10. The State of Maharashtra preferred criminal appeal (No. 566 of 2007) under Section 378(3) of the Code challenging the acquittal of the appellant under Sections 304 Part II and 338 IPC. Another criminal appeal (No. 430 of 2007) was also preferred by the State of Maharashtra seeking enhancement of sentence awarded to the appellant for the offence under Section 304A and Section 337 IPC by the trial court.

11. The appellant also preferred criminal appeal (No. 475/2007) for setting aside the judgment and order dated April 13, 2007 passed by the trial court convicting him under Section 304A and Section 337 IPC and the sentence awarded to him by the trial court.

12. All these matters were heard together by the High Court and have been disposed of by the common judgment on September 6, 2007. The High Court set aside the acquittal of the appellant under Section 304 IPC and convicted him for the offences under Section 304 Part II, Section 338 and Section 337 IPC. The High  Court sentenced the appellant to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years for the offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC with a fine of Rs. 5 lakhs.

On account of offence under Section 338 IPC, the appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year and for the offence under Section 337 IPC rigorous imprisonment for six months. The High Court noted that fine amount as per the order of the trial court had already been distributed to the families of victims.

13. It is from the above judgment of the High Court that the present appeals have been preferred by the appellant.

14. A great deal of argument in the hearing of the appeals turned on the indictment of the appellant on the two charges, namely, the offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC and the offence punishable under Section 338 IPC and his conviction for the above offences and also under Section 337 IPC. Mr. U.U. Lalit, learned  senior counsel for the appellant argued that this was legally impermissible as the charges under Section 304 Part II IPC and Section 338 IPC were mutually destructive and the two charges under these Sections cannot co-exist. His submission was that the appellant was charged for the above offences for committing a single act i.e., rash or negligent for causing injuries to eight persons and at the same time committed with knowledge resulting in death of seven persons which is irreconcilable and moreover that has caused grave prejudice to the appellant resulting in failure of justice.

15. Mr. U.U. Lalit, learned senior counsel also argued that no question was put to the appellant in his statement under Section 313 of the Code about his drunken condition or that he was under the influence of alcohol and, thus, had knowledge that his act was likely to result in causing death. CA Report (Ex. 49) that blood and urine of the appellant had alcohol content and the evidence of PW-1 that he found the appellant in drunken  condition and his blood sample was taken were also not put to the appellant. These incriminating evidences, learned senior counsel submitted, cannot form basis of conviction. The conclusion arrived at by the Investigating Officers (PW-17 and PW-18) regarding drunken condition of the appellant which was put to the appellant in his statement under Section 313 of the Code was of no legal use. Moreover, PW-17 and PW-18 have not deposed before the court that the appellant was found in drunken condition much less under the influence of liquor.

Learned senior counsel would thus submit that the sole basis of the appellant's conviction under Section 304 Part-II IPC that the appellant had knowledge that his reckless and negligent driving in a drunken condition could result in serious consequences of causing a fatal accident cannot be held to have been established. In this regard, learned senior counsel relied upon two decisions of this Court, namely, (i) Ghulam Din Buch & Ors. v. State of J & K1 and (ii) Kuldip Singh & Ors. v. State of Delhi2.

1 1996 (9) SCC 239 2 2003 (12) SCC 528
16. Mr. U.U. Lalit vehemently contended that no charge was framed that the appellant had consumed alcohol. Moreover, he submited that no reliance could be placed on C.A. Report (Ex. 49) as the evidence does not satisfactorily establish that the samples were kept in safe custody until they reached the CFSL. Moreover, no charge was framed by the court against the appellant under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Section 66(1)(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949.

17. Learned senior counsel argued that appellant's conviction under Section 304A, 338 and 337 IPC was not legally sustainable for more than one reason.

First, no charge under Section 304A IPC was framed against the appellant as he was charged only under Section 304 Part II IPC and Section 338 IPC which are not the offences of the same category. In the absence of charge under Section 304A IPC, the appellant cannot be convicted for the said offence being not a minor offence of Section 304 Part II IPC. The charge under Section 338  IPC does not help the prosecution as by virtue of that charge the appellant cannot be convicted under Section 304A IPC being graver offence than Section 338 IPC.

Secondly, the accident had occurred not on account of rash or negligent act of the appellant but on account of failure of the engine. He referred to the evidence of Rajendra Nilkanth Sawant (PW-15) who deposed that he could not state if the accident took place due to dislodging of right side wheel and dislodging of the engine from the foundation. In the absence of any firm opinion by an expert as regards the cause of accident, the possibility of the accident having occurred on account of mechanical failure cannot be ruled out. Thirdly, in the absence of medical certificate that the persons injured received grievous injuries, charge under Section 338 IPC was not established.

18. Learned senior counsel lastly submitted that in case the charges against appellant are held to be proved, having regard to the facts, namely, the age of the  appellant at the time of the accident; the appellant being the only member to support his family - mother and unmarried sister - having lost his father during the pendency of the present appeals; the fine and compensation of Rs. 8.5 lakhs having been paid and the sentence of two months already undergone, the appellant may be released on probation of good conduct and behavior or, in the alternative, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone by the appellant.",0,

1. Leave granted.

2. Whether a complaint can be filed by a citizen for prosecuting a public servant for an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short, `the 1988 Act') and whether the authority competent to sanction prosecution of a public servant for offences under the 1988 Act is required to take an appropriate decision within the time specified in clause I(15) of the directions contained in paragraph 58 of the judgment of this Court in Vineet Narain v.

Union of India (1998) 1 SCC 226 and the guidelines issued by the  Central Government, Department of Personnel and Training and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) are the question which require consideration in this appeal.

3. For the last more than three years, the appellant has been vigorously pursuing, in public interest, the cases allegedly involving loss of thousands of crores of rupees to the Public Exchequer due to arbitrary and illegal grant of licences at the behest of Mr. A. Raja (respondent No. 2) who was appointed as Minister for Communication and Information Technology on 16.5.2007 by the President on the advice of Dr. Manmohan Singh (respondent No. 1). After collecting information about the grant of licences, the appellant made detailed representation dated 29.11.2008 to respondent No. 1 to accord sanction for prosecution of respondent No. 2 for offences under the 1988 Act.

In his representation, the appellant pointed out that respondent No. 2 had allotted new licences in 2G mobile services on `first come, first served' basis to novice telecom companies, viz., Swan Telecom and Unitech, which was in clear violation of Clause 8 of the Guidelines for United Access Services Licence issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology vide letter No.10-21/2005-BS.I(Vol.II)/49 dated 14.12.2005 and,  thereby, caused loss of over Rs. 50,000 crores to the Government.

The appellant gave details of the violation of Clause 8 and pointed out that the two officers, viz., R.J.S. Kushwaha and D. Jha of the Department of Telecom, who had opposed the showing of undue favour to Swan Telecom, were transferred just before the grant of licences and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) which had never entered into a roaming agreement with any operator, was forced to enter into such an agreement with Swan Telecom. The appellant further pointed out that immediately after acquiring 2G spectrum licences, Swan Telecom and Unitech sold their stakes to foreign companies, i.e., Etisalat, a telecom operator from UAE and Telenor of Norway respectively and, thereby, made huge profits at the expense of public revenue. He claimed that by 2G spectrum allocation under respondent No. 2, the Government received only one-sixth of what it would have received if it had opted for an auction. The appellant pointed out how respondent No. 2 ignored the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and gave totally unwarranted benefits to the two companies and thereby caused loss to the Public Exchequer. Some of the portions of the appellant's representation are extracted below:

""Clause 8 has been violated as follows: While Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), the promoters of Reliance Communications (R Com), had more than 10 per cent stake in Swan Telecom, the figures were manipulated and showed as 9.99 per cent holding to beat the said Clause. The documents available disclose that on March 2, 2007, when Swan Telecom applied for United Access Services Licences, it was owned 100 per cent by Reliance Communications and its associates viz. Reliance Telecom, and by Tiger Trustees Limited, Swan Infonet Services Private Limited, and Swan Advisory Services Private Limited (see Annexure I). At one or the other point of time, employees of ADAG (Himanshu Agarwal, Ashish Karyekar, Paresh Rathod) or its associate companies have been acquiring the shares of Swan Telecom itself. But still the ADAG manipulated the holdings in Swan to reduce it to only 9.99 per cent. Ambani has now quietly sold his shares in Swan to Delphi Investments, a Mauritius based company owned by Ahmed O. Alfi, specializing in automobile spare parts. In turn, Swan has sold 45% of its shares to UAE's Emirates Telecom Corporation (Etisalat) for Rs.9000 crores! All this is highly suspicious and not normal business transactions.

Swan company got 60% of the 22 Telecom licenced areas at a throw away price of Rs.1650 crores, when it was worth Rs.60,000 crores total.

Room has operations in the same circles where the application for Swan Telecom was filed. Therefore, under Clause 8 of the Guidelines, Swan should not have been allotted spectrum by the Telecommunication Ministry. But the company did get it on Minister's direction, which is an undue favour from him (Raja).

There was obviously a quid pro quo which only a CBI enquiry can reveal, after an FIR is registered. There is no need for a P/E, because the CVC has already done the preliminary enquiry.

Quite surprisingly, the 2G spectrum licences were priced at 2001 levels to benefit these private players.

That was when there were only 4 million cellphone  subscribers; now it is 350 million. Hence 2001 price is not applicable today.

Immediately after acquiring 2G spectrum licences both Swan and Unitech sold their stakes to foreign companies at a huge profits. While Swan Telecom sold its stakes to UAE telecom operator Etisalat, Unitech signed a deal with Telenor of Norway for selling its share at huge premiums.

In the process of this 2G spectrum allocation, the government received only one-sixth of what it would have got had it gone through a fresh auction route.

The total loss to the exchequer of giving away 2G GSM spectrum in this way - including to the CDMA operators - is over Rs.50,000 crores and is said to be one of the biggest financial scams of all times in the country.

While approving the 2G licences, Minister Raja turned a blind eye to the fact that these two companies do not have any infrastructure to launch their services.

Falsely claiming that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had approved the first-cum-first served rule, Raja went ahead with the 2G spectrum allocation to two debutants in the Telecom sector. In fact earlier TRAI had discussed the spectrum allocation issue with existing services providers and suggested to the Telecom Ministry that spectrum allocation be made through a transparent tender and auction process.

This is confirmed by what the TRAI Chairman N. Misra told the CII organized conference on November 28, 2008 (Annexure 2). But Raja did not bother to listen to the TRAI either and pursued the process on `first come, first served' basis, benefiting those who had inside information, causing a loss of Rs.50,000 crores to the Government. His dubious move has been to ensure benefit to others at the cost of the national exchequer.""

The request made in the representation, which was relied upon by the learned Attorney General for showing that the  appellant had himself asked for an investigation, is also extracted below:

""According to an uncontradicted report in CNN-IBN news channel of November 26, 2008, you are said to be ""very upset with A. Raja over the spectrum allocation issue"". This confirms that an investigation is necessary, for which I may be given sanction so that the process of law can be initiated.
I, therefore, writ to demand the grant of sanction to prosecute Mr. A. Raja, Minister for Telecom of the Union of India for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The charges in brief are annexed herewith (Annexure 3).""
4. Since the appellant did not receive any response from respondent No.1, he sent letters dated 30.5.2009, 23.10.2009, 31.10.2009, 8.3.2010 and 13.3.2010 and reiterated his request/demand for grant of sanction to prosecute respondent No.2. In his letter dated 31.10.2009, the appellant referred to the fact that on being directed by the CVC, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a first information report, and claimed that prima facie case is established against respondent No. 2 for his prosecution under Sections 11 and 13(1)(d) of the 1988 Act. The appellant also claimed that according to various Supreme Court judgments it was not necessary to carry out a detailed inquiry, and he had produced sufficient evidence for  grant of sanction to initiate criminal prosecution against respondent No. 2 for the misuse of authority and pecuniary gains from corrupt practices. In his subsequent letters, the appellant again asserted that the nation had suffered loss of nearly Rs.65,000 crores due to arbitrary, unreasonable and mala fide action of respondent No.2. In letter dated 13.3.2010, the appellant referred to the proceedings of the case in which this Court refused to interfere with the order of the Delhi High Court declaring that the decision of respondent No.2 to change the cut off date fixed for consideration of applications made for grant of licences was arbitrary and mala fide.

5. After 1 year and 4-1/2 months of the first letter written by him, Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training, Ministry of Personnel sent letter dated 19.3.2010 to the appellant mentioning therein that the CBI had registered a case on 21.10.2009 against unknown officers of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), unknown private persons/companies and others and that the issue of grant of sanction for prosecution would arise only after perusal of the evidence collected by the investigating agency and other material provided to the Competent Authority and that it  would be premature to consider sanction for prosecution at that stage.

6. On receipt of the aforesaid communication, the appellant filed Civil Writ Petition No. 2442/2010 in the Delhi High Court and prayed for issue of a mandamus to respondent No.1 to pass an order for grant of sanction for prosecution of respondent No. 2.

The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court referred to the submission of the learned Solicitor General that when respondent No. 1 has directed investigation by the CBI and the investigation is in progress, it is not permissible to take a decision on the application of the appellant either to grant or refuse the sanction because that may affect the investigation, and dismissed the writ petition by recording the following observations:

""The question that emanates for consideration is whether, at this stage, when the investigation by the CBI is in progress and this Court had earlier declined to monitor the same by order dated 25th May, 2010, which has been pressed into service by the learned Solicitor General of India, it would be appropriate to direct the respondent no. 1 to take a decision as regards the application submitted by the petitioner seeking sanction to prosecute.
In our considered opinion, when the matter is being investigated by the CBI, and the investigation is in progress, it would not be in fitness of things to issue a mandamus to the first respondent to take a decision on the application of the petitioner.""
7. The special leave petition filed by the appellant, out of which this appeal arises, was initially taken up for consideration along with SLP(C) No. 24873/2010 filed by the Center for Public Interest Litigation against order dated 25.5.2010 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3522/2010 to which reference had been made in the impugned order. During the course of hearing of the special leave petition filed by the appellant, the learned Solicitor General, who had appeared on behalf of respondent No. 1, made a statement that he has got the record and is prepared to place the same before the Court.

However, keeping in view the fact that the record sought to be produced by the learned Solicitor General may not be readily available to the appellant, the Court passed order dated 18.11.2010 requiring the filing of an affidavit on behalf of respondent No. 1. Thereafter, Shri V. Vidyavati, Director in the PMO filed affidavit dated 20.11.2010, which reveals the following facts:

""(i) On 1.12.2008, the Prime Minister perused the letter and noted ""Please examine and let me know the facts of this case"". This was marked to the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister who in turn marked it to the Secretary. The Secretary marked it to me as Director in the PMO. I prepared a note dated 5.12.2008 factually  summarizing the allegations and seeking approval to obtain the factual position from the sectoral side (in the PMO dealing with Telecommunications).
(ii) On 11.12.2008, a copy of appellant's letter dated 29.11.2008 was sent to the Secretary, Department of Telecommunication for submitting a factual report.

The Department of Telecommunication sent reply dated 13.02.2009 incorporating his comments.

(iii) In the meanwhile, letters dated 10.11.2008 and 22.11.2008 were received from Shri Gurudas Gupta and Shri Suravaran Sudhakar Reddy respectively (copies of these letters have not been produced before the Court). The same were forwarded to the Department of Telecommunication on 25.03.2009 for sending an appropriate reply to the appellant.

(iv) On 01.06.2009, letter dated 30.05.2009 received from the appellant was placed before respondent No.1, who recorded the following endorsement ""please examine and discuss"".

(v) On 19.06.2009, the Director of the concerned Sector in the PMO recorded that the Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology has sent D.O. letter dated 18.06.2009 to the appellant.

When letter dated 23.10.2009 of the appellant was placed before respondent No.1, he recorded an endorsement on 27.10.2009 ""please discuss"".

(vi) In response to letter dated 31.10.2009 of the appellant, respondent No.1 made an endorsement ""please examine"".

(vii) On 18.11.2009, respondent No.1 stated that Ministry of Law and Justice should examine and advice. The advice of Ministry of Law and Justice was received on 8.2.2010. Para 7 thereof was as follows:

""From the perusal of letter dated 23.10.2009 and 31.10.2009, it is noticed that Shri Swamy wants to rely upon the action and investigation of the CBI to collaborate and strengthen the said  allegation leveled by him against Shri A. Raja, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. It is specifically mentioned in Para 2 of the letter dated 31.10.2009 of Shri Swamy that the FIR was registered by the CBI and ""the substance of the allegation made by me in the above cited letters to you are already under investigation"". If it is so, then it may be stated that decision to accord of sanction of prosecution may be determined only after the perusal of the evidence (oral or documentary) collected by the investigation agency, i.e., CBI and other materials to be provided to the competent authority.""
(viii) On 05.03.2010, the deponent prepared a note that an appropriate reply be sent to the appellant in the light of the advice given by the Law Department and final reply was sent to the appellant after respondent No.1 had approved note dated 17.03.2010.""
8. The appellant filed rejoinder affidavit on 22.11.2010 along with a copy of letter dated 18.6.2009 written to him by respondent No. 2 in the context of representation dated 29.11.2008 submitted by him to respondent No.1.

9. Although, respondent No.2 resigned from the Council of Ministers on 14.11.2010, the appellant submitted that the issues relating to his right to file a complaint for prosecution of respondent No.2 and grant of sanction within the time specified in the judgment in Vineet Narain's case should be decided.

10. During the course of hearing, the learned Attorney General filed written submissions. After the hearing concluded, the learned Attorney General filed supplementary written submissions along with a compilation of 126 cases in which the sanction for prosecution is awaited for periods ranging from more than one year to few months

11. Final order in this case was deferred because it was felt that the directions given by this Court in Vineet Narain's case may require further elaboration in the light of the order passed in Civil Appeal No. 10660/2010 (arising out of SLP(C) No. 24873/2010) and the fact that decision on the question of grant of sanction under the 1988 Act and other statutes is pending for a sufficiently long time in 126 cases. However, as the investigation with regard to some of the facets of what has come to be termed as 2G case is yet to be completed, we have considered it appropriate to pass final order in the matter.

12. Appellant Dr. Subramanian Swamy argued that the embargo contained in Section 19(1) of the 1988 Act operates only against the taking of cognizance by the Court in respect of offences punishable under Sections 7, 10, 11, 13 and 15 committed by a public servant, but there is no bar to the filing of a private  complaint for prosecution of the concerned public servant and grant of sanction by the Competent Authority, and that respondent No. 1 was duty bound to take appropriate decision on his representation within the time specified in clause I(15) of the directions contained in paragraph 58 of Vineet Narain's case, more so because he had placed sufficient evidence to show that respondent No.2 had committed offences under the 1988 Act.

13. The learned Attorney General argued that the question of grant of sanction for prosecution of a public servant charged with any of the offences enumerated in Section 19(1) arises only at the stage when the Court decides to take cognizance and any request made prior to that is premature. He submitted that the embargo contained in Section 19(1) of the Act is applicable to the Court which is competent to take cognizance of an offence punishable under Sections 7, 10, 11, 13 and 15 alleged to have been committed by a public servant and there is no provision for grant of sanction at a stage before the competent Court applies its mind to the issue of taking cognizance. Learned Attorney General relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs v. Abani Kumar Banerjee AIR 1950 Cal. 437 as also the judgments of this Court in R.R. Chari v.",1,
Adarsh Shiksha Mahavidyalaya and others,"2. The importance of teachers and their training has been highlighted time and again by eminent educationists and leaders of society. The Courts have also laid considerable emphasis on the dire need of having qualified teachers in schools and colleges.

2.1 In Ahmedabad St. Xavier's College Society v. State of Gujarat (1974) 1 SCC 717, A.N. Ray, C.J., observed:

""Educational institutions are temples of learning. The virtues of human intelligence are mastered and harmonised by education. Where there is complete harmony between the teacher and the taught, where the teacher imparts and the student receives, where there is complete dedication of the teacher and the taught in learning, where there is discipline between the teacher and the taught, where both are worshippers of learning, no discord or challenge will arise. An educational institution runs smoothly when the teacher and the taught are engaged in the common ideal of pursuit of knowledge. It is, therefore, manifest that the appointment of teachers is an important part in educational institutions. The qualifications and the character of the teachers are really important. The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions. This right implies the obligation and duty of the minority institutions to render the very best to the students. In the right of administration, checks and balances in the shape of regulatory measures are required to ensure the  4 4 appointment of good teachers and their conditions of service. The right to administer is to be tempered with regulatory measures to facilitate smooth administration. The best administration will reveal no trace or colour of minority. A minority institution should shine in exemplary eclectism in the administration of the institution. The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on or proclaim its minority character. Regulations which will serve the interests of the students, regulations which will serve the interests of the teachers are of paramount importance in good administration. Regulations in the interest of efficiency of teachers, discipline and fairness in administration are necessary for preserving harmony among affiliated institutions. Education should be a great cohesive force in developing integrity of the nation. Education develops the ethos of the nation. Regulations are, therefore, necessary to see that there are no divisive or disintegrating forces in administration.""
2.2 In Andhra Kesari Education Society v. Director of School Education (1989) 1 SCC 392, this Court observed:

""Though teaching is the last choice in the job market, the role of teachers is central to all processes of formal education. The teacher alone could bring out the skills and intellectual capabilities of students. He is the `engine' of the educational system. He is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values. He needs to be endowed and energised with needed potential to deliver enlightened service expected of him. His quality should be such as would  5 5 inspire and motivate into action the benefiter. He must keep himself abreast of ever-changing conditions. He is not to perform in a wooden and unimaginative way. He must eliminate fissiparous tendencies and attitudes and infuse nobler and national ideas in younger minds. His involvement in national integration is more important, indeed indispensable. It is, therefore, needless to state that teachers should be subjected to rigorous training with rigid scrutiny of efficiency. It has greater relevance to the needs of the day. The ill-trained or sub-standard teachers would be detrimental to our educational system; if not a punishment on our children. The government and the University must, therefore, take care to see that inadequacy in the training of teachers is not compounded by any extraneous consideration.""
2.3 In State of Maharashtra v. Vikas Sahebrao Roundale (1992) 4 SCC 435, the Court said:

""The teacher plays pivotal role in moulding the career, character and moral fibres and aptitude for educational excellence in impressive young children. Formal education needs proper equipping of the teachers to meet the challenges of the day to impart lessons with latest techniques to the students on secular, scientific and rational outlook. A well-equipped teacher could bring the needed skills and intellectual capabilities to the students in their pursuits. The teacher is adorned as Gurudevobhava, next after parents, as he is a principal instrument to awakening the child to the cultural ethos, intellectual excellence and discipline. The teachers, therefore, must keep abreast of ever- changing techniques, the needs of the society and to cope up with the psychological approach to the aptitudes of the children to perform that pivotal role. In short teachers need to be  6 6 endowed and energised with needed potential to serve the needs of the society. The qualitative training in the training colleges or schools would inspire and motivate them into action to the benefit of the students. For equipping such trainee students in a school or a college, all facilities and equipments are absolutely necessary and institutions bereft thereof have no place to exist nor entitled to recognition. In that behalf compliance of the statutory requirements is insisted upon. Slackening the standard and judicial fiat to control the mode of education and examining system are detrimental to the efficient management of the education.""
2.4 In St. Johns' Teachers Training Institute (for Women), Madurai v. State of Tamil Nadu (1993) 3 SCC 595, the Court observed:

""The teacher-education programme has to be redesigned to bring in a system of education which can prepare the student-teacher to shoulder the responsibility of imparting education with a living dynamism. Education being closely interrelated to life the well trained teacher can instil an aesthetic excellence in the life of his pupil. The traditional, stereotyped, lifeless and dull pattern of ""chalk, talk and teach"" method has to be replaced by a more vibrant system with improved methods of teaching, to achieve qualitative excellence in teacher- education.""
2.5 In N.M. Nageshwaramma v. State of Andhra Pradesh 1986 (Supp.) SCC 166, the Court observed:

""The Teachers Training Institutes are meant to teach children of impressionable age and we  7 7 cannot let loose on the innocent and unwary children, teachers who have not received proper and adequate training. True they will be required to pass the examination but that may not be enough. Training for a certain minimum period in a properly organised and equipped Training Institute is probably essential before a teacher may be duly launched.""
3. We have prefaced disposal of these appeals, which are directed against interlocutory order dated 17.12.2008 and final order dated 13.03.2009 passed by the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 6146 of 2008 and connected matters by highlighting the need for well-equipped and trained teachers because in the last three decades private institutions engaged in conducting teacher training courses / programmes have indulged in brazen and bizarre exploitation of the aspirants for admission to teacher training courses and ranked commercialisation and the regulatory bodies constituted under the laws enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures have failed to stem the rot. The cases filed by these institutions, many of whom have not been granted recognition due to non- fulfilment of the conditions specified in the National Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993 (for short, `the 1993 Act') and the Regulations framed thereunder and by the students who have taken admission in such institutions with the hope that at the  8 8 end of the day they will be able to get favourable order by invoking sympathy of the Court, have choked the dockets of various High Courts and even this Court. The enormity of litigation in this field gives an impression that implementation of the provisions contained in the 1993 Act and the Regulations framed thereunder has been acutely deficient and the objects sought to be achieved by enacting the special legislation, namely, planned and coordinated development of the teacher education system throughout the country, the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the teacher education system have not been fulfilled so far.

4. Before adverting to the appellants' grievance against the orders passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 6146 of 2008 Subhash Rahangdale and connected cases, we consider it necessary to notice the scheme of the 1993 Act and the Regulations framed thereunder.

THE SCHEME OF THE 1993 ACT AND THE REGULATIONS 5.1 With a view to achieve the object of planned and coordinated development for the teacher education system throughout the country and for regulation and proper maintenance of  9 9 norms and standards in the teacher education system and for matters connected therewith, Parliament enacted the 1993 Act. The 1993 Act provides for the establishment of a Council to be called the National Council for Teacher Education (for short ""the NCTE"") with multifarious functions, powers and duties. Section 2(c) of the Act defines the term ""council"" to mean a council established under sub-section (1) of Section 3. Section 2(i) defines the term ""recognised institution"" to mean an institution recognised under Section

14. Section 2(j) defines the term ""Regional Committee"" to mean a committee established under Section 20. Section 3 provides for establishment of the Council which comprises of a Chairperson, a Vice-Chairperson, a Member-Secretary, various functionaries of the Government, thirteen persons possessing experience and knowledge in the field of education or teaching, nine members representing the States and the Union Territories administration, three members of Parliament, three members to be appointed from amongst teachers of primary and secondary education and teachers of recognised institutions. Section 12 of the Act enumerates functions of the Council. Section 14 provides for recognition  10 1 of institutions offering course or training in teacher education. Section 15 lays down the procedure for obtaining permission by an existing institution for starting a new course or training. Section 16 contains a non obstante clause and lays down that an examining body shall not grant affiliation to any institution or hold examination for a course or training conducted by a recognised institution unless it has obtained recognition from the Regional Committee concerned under Section 14 or permission for starting a new course or training under Section 15. The mechanism for dealing with the cases involving violation of the provisions of the Act or the Rules, Regulations, Orders made or issued thereunder or the conditions of recognition by a recognised institution finds place in Section 17. By an amendment made in July 2006, Section 17-A was added to the Act. It lays down that no institution shall admit any student to a course or training in teacher education unless it has obtained recognition under Section 14 or permission under Section

15. Section 31(1) empowers the Central Government to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 31(2) specifies the matters in respect of which the Central  11 1 Government can make rules. Under Section 32(1) the Council can make regulations for implementation of the provisions of the Act subject to the rider that the regulations shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder. Section 32(2) specifies the matters on which the Council can frame regulations. In terms of Section 33, the Rules framed under Section 31 and the Regulations framed under Section 32 are required to be laid before Parliament. By virtue of Section 34(1), the Central Government has been clothed with the power to issue an order to remove any difficulty arising in the implementation of the provisions of the Act.

5.2 The relevant portions of Sections 12, 14 to 16, 17, 17-A, 18, 20, 29 and 32 of the Act which have bearing on the decision of these appeals are reproduced below:

Mohd. Hussain @ Julfikar Ali,"1) A convict, who is facing the threat of death gallows, is before us in this appeal. He is an illiterate foreign national and unable to engage a counsel to defend himself. He is tried, convicted and sentenced to death by the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi in Sessions Case No.122 of 1998 dated 03.11.2004 without assignment of counsel for his defence. Such a result is confirmed by the High Court on a reference made by the Trial Court for confirmation of death sentence and has dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant vide its order dated 04.08.2006.
2) The convict, (hereinafter referred to as ""appellant"") is charged, convicted and sentenced under Sections 302/307 of Indian Penal Code (in short, ""IPC"") and also under Section 3 of The Explosive Substances Act, 1908. The case of the prosecution, as noticed by the High Court, which appears to be accurate statement of facts, proceeds on these lines :

"" 2. On 30-12-1997 at about 6.20 p.m. one blueline bus No.DL-IP-3088 carrying passengers on its route to Nangloi from Ajmeri Gate stopped at the Ram Pura Bus Stand on Rohtak Road for passengers to get down. The moment that bus stopped there an explosion took place inside the bus because of which its floor got ripped apart. Four passengers of that bus, namely, Ms. Tapoti, Taj Mohd. Narain Jha and Rajiv Verma died and twenty four passengers including the conductor of that bus were injured due to that explosion. Two policemen (PWs 41 &
52) were on checking duty at that but stop at the time of blast. On their informing the local police station police team reached the spot. Crime team and bomb disposal squad were also called and the damaged bus was inspected and from the spot debris etc. were lifted and sealed.
3. On the basis of the statement of Head Constable Suresh (PW-41), who was one of the two policemen on duty at the bus stop of Rampura, a case under Section 307 IPC and Section 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substances Act was registered at Punjabi Bagh police station. Investigation commenced immediately. With the death of some of the injured persons on the day of the incident itself Section 302 IPC was also added. Hunt for the culprits responsible for that macabre incident also  started. However, for over two months nobody could be nabbed.

4. It appears that as a result of different incidents of bomb blasts in Delhi including the present one the intelligence agencies became more active and started gathering information about the incidents of bomb blasts in the city. It came to light that some persons belonging to terrorist organizations were actively operating in the city of Delhi for causing terror by killing innocent people and causing damage to public property by exploding bombs. On the basis of secret information the police raided some houses in different parts of Delhi on 27.02.1998 and from those houses hand grenades and material used for making bombs was recovered in large quantity. The chemicals recovered were sent to CFSL, which confirmed that the same were potassium chlorate and sulphuric acid and were opined to be constituents of low explosives. Some persons were arrested also and during interrogation they had disclosed to the police that they were members of a terrorist organization and their aim was to create terror and panic in different parts of the country by exploding bombs to take revenge for the killings of innocent muslims (sic.) in India and further that they had come to India for Jehad. On 27.02.1998 itself the police had registered a case vide FIR No.49 of 1998 under Sections 121/121-A IPC and Sections 3, 4 & 5 of the Explosive Substances Act as well under Section 25 of the Arms Act at Main Delhi Railway Station. On the basis of information provided by the apprehended terrorists the police made more arrests including that of one Mohd. Hussain (who now is the appellant before us in Crl. A. No.41 of 2005 and reference to him will now onwards be made as `the appellant'). The appellant was apprehended when his house in Lajpat Nagar was raided pursuant to the information given by other apprehended terrorists. As per the prosecution case the appellant himself had opened the door on being knocked by the police and on seeing the police party he had tried to fire at the policemen from the pistol which he was having in  his hand at that time but could not succeed and was apprehended. His pistol was seized. It appears that during the interrogation by the police the appellant and three more persons, namely, Abdul Rehman, Mohd. Ezaz Ahmed and Mohd. Maqsood confessed about their involvement in the present incident of bomb blast in the bus on 30.12.1997. That information was then passed over to Punjabi Bagh police station on 18.03.1998 by the Crime Branch and accordingly all these four persons were formally arrested for the present case also on 21.3.1998 for which date the investigating officer of the present case had sought their production in court by getting issued production warrants from the court seized of the above referred case of FIR No.49/1998. The investigating officer moved an application before the concerned court on the same day for holding of Test Identification Parade (TIP) in respect of the appellant in view of the suspicion expressed by PW-1 Darshan Kumar, the conductor of the bus involved in the blast regarding one passenger who had boarded his bus from Paharganj bus stop along with a rexine bag for going to Nangloi but instead of going upto Nangloi he had got down from the bus at Karol Bagh leaving his rexine bag underneath the seat which he had taken and which was near the seat of the conductor. The conductor had given the description of that passenger. As per the prosecution case the explosion had taken place below that seat which that passenger had occupied and underneath which he had kept his rexine bag. Although on 21-03-98 the appellant did not object to holding of identification parade but he refused to joint test identification parade which was fixed for 23-03-98 stating that police had taken his photographs.

5. During the investigation of the present case the debris collected from the place of bomb blast and some damaged pieces of the bus etc. were sent to Central Forensic Laboratory (CFSL) and after examination it was revealed that in the seized material contained explosive mixture of chlorate, Nitrate, Sulphate and  sugar were detected. Mixture of these chemicals, as per CFSL, report Ex. PW-34/A, is used for making explosives/bombs and the mixture could have been initiated by the action of sulphuric acid and the mixture was ""explosive substance"".

6. On completion of investigation of the present case the police filed a charge-sheet in Court against four accused persons for the commission of offences under Sections 302/307/120-B IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Explosive Substances Act. In due course the four persons were committed to Sessions Court. The learned Additional Sessions Judge vide order dated 18.2.1999 discharged three accused persons namely, Abdul Rehman, Mohd. Maqsood and Ezaz Ahmed while against fourth accused Mohd. Hussain @ Julfikar (the appellant herein) charges under Sections 302/307 IPC and Section 3 and in the alternative u/s 4(b) of the Explosive Substances Act were framed. The appellant had pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him and claimed to be tried.""

3) The prosecution had examined as many as 65 witnesses and on conclusion of prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short, ""Cr.P.C""), who had denied his guilt and pleaded false implication. The Trial Court, upon appreciation of evidence of the prosecution witnesses, held the appellant guilty of the charges and accordingly, imposed death penalty. The conviction and sentence is affirmed by the High Court. At this stage itself, it is relevant to notice that the appellant had pleaded, both before the Trial Court and the  High Court, that he was not given a fair and impartial trial and he was denied the right of a counsel. The High Court has noticed this contention and has answered against the appellant. In the words of the High Court :

"" 45. Faced with this situation Mr. Luthra came out with an arguments that this case, in fact, needs to be remanded back to the trial back for a fresh trial because the trial court record would reveal that the accused did not have a fair trial inasmuch as on most of the hearing when material witnesses were examined he was unrepresented and the trial court did not bother to provide him legal aid at State expense and by not doing that the Trial Court, in fact, failed to discharge its pious duty of ensuring that the accused was defended properly and effectively at all stages of the trial either by his private counsel or in the absence of private counsel by an experienced and responsible amicus curiae. Mr. Luthra also submitted that, in fact, the learned Additional Sessions Judge himself should have taken active part at the time of recording of evidence of prosecution witnesses by putting questions to the witnesses who had been examined in the absence of counsel for the accused. It was contended that the right of the accused ensured to him under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India for a fair trial has been, thus, violated. In support of this argument which, in fact, appears to us to be the sheet anchor for the appellant, Mr. Siddharth Lutha cited some judgments also of the Hon'ble Supreme Court which are reproduced as AIR 1997 SC 1023, 1994 Supp. (3) SCC 321, AIR 1986 SC 991 and 1983 (III) SCC 307. One judgment of Gauhati High Court reported as 1987 (1) Crimes 133, ""Arjun Karmakar Vs. State of Assam"" was also relied upon by Mr. Luthra.
46. There can be no dispute about the legal proposition put forward by the learned counsel for the appellant that it is the duty of the Court to see and ensure that an accused in a criminal trial is represented with diligence by a defence counsel and in case an accused during the trial remains unrepresented because of poverty etc., it becomes the duty of the Court to provide him legal aid at State expense. We find from the judgment of the trial Court that this point was raised on behalf of the accused during the trial also by the amicus curiae provided to the accused when his private counsel stopped appearing for him. The learned trial Court dealt with this arguments in para no.101 of the judgment which is as under:- ""It is next submitted that material witnesses have not been cross examined by the accused and as such, their testimony cannot be read against him. I may add that from the very beginning of the trial, the accused has been represented by a counsel Sh. Riaz Mohd. and he had cross-examined some of the witnesses. Later on, when Sh. Riaz Mohd. did not appear in the Court on some dates, Mrs. Sadhna Bhatia was appointed as Amicus- Curiae to defend the accused at State expenses. If the accused did not choose to cross examine some witnesses, he cannot be forced to do so. Moreover, later one accused prayed for cross-examination of PW-1 Sh. Darshan Kumar, which was allowed though it was filed at a belated stage after a long period of time. The accused did not desire any other witness to be cross examined. Not only this, statement of PW-1 Sh. Darshan Kumar was recorded on 18-05-1999 and he was also present on 3-6-1999 and 13-08-1999, but on all three dates, the cross-examination of this witness was deferred at the request of the accused, who was ultimately discharged with nil cross-examination. This shows that accused himself was not interested in cross-examining the witnesses. As such, this submission is also without merit.""

47. We have ourselves also perused the trial court record and we are convinced that it is not a case where it can be said that the accused did not have a fair trial or that he had been denied legal aid. We are in full agreement with the above quoted views of the learned Additional Sessions Judge on this objection of the accused and we refuse to accept the plea of the appellant that this case should be remanded back for a re-trial. ""
4) I have heard learned counsel Mr. Mobin Akhtar for the appellant and Mr. J.S. Atri, learned senior counsel for the State.

5) In this Court, the judgments are assailed, apart from the merits, that the appellant is denied due process of law and the conduct of the trial is contrary to procedure prescribed under the provisions of Cr. P.C. and, in particular, that he was not given a fair and impartial trial and was denied the right of a counsel. Since the aforesaid issue is of vital importance, I have thought it fit to answer that issue before I discuss the merits of the appeal. Therefore, firstly, I will consider the issue; whether the appellant was given a fair and impartial trial and, whether he was denied the right of a counsel. To answer this issue, it may not be necessary to discuss the facts of the case or the circumstances surrounding the prosecution case except so far they reflect upon the aforesaid issue.",1,
MOHD. AYUB & ANR.,"1. This appeal, by grant of special leave, is directed against the judgment and order dated 12.9.2005 passed by the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital partly allowing the Writ Petition No. 296 of 2004 filed by the appellants.

2. The appellants/landlords filed an application under Section 21 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 (for short, `the U.P Act') for eviction of the respondent/tenant on the ground  that they bona fide required the premises occupied by the respondent to start business for their sons.

3. According to the appellants when the house in question was purchased by them the respondent was occupying two shops facing the road and two rooms situate at the rear of the said shops as a tenant of the previous landlord at the rent of Rs.35/- per month. These rooms are situated on the ground floor of the said building. The respondent continued to occupy the said rooms as tenant at the same rent. It is the case of the appellants that the first appellant is carrying on business in three small stalls situated in a shop of the Cantonment Council, the rent of which keeps increasing.

The three sons of the appellants aged 23, 28 and 19 years are unemployed. Two sons want to start general merchant business in one shop and the third son wants to start wholesale egg business in the other shop. The appellants' family consists of 13 members. Their one son is married and has three children and the two other sons are of a marriageable age. The married son wants to live in the  room behind the shop. Presently, the appellants' family is living in three rooms and a verandah with great difficulty.

On these grounds the appellants filed the application for release of the rooms in occupation of the respondent.

4. In response, the respondent inter alia contended that he is conducting photography business from the said shops for many years; that he is enjoying goodwill in the area;

that he will find it difficult to get premises in the same area;

that appellants are financially well off as compared to him;

that they own other properties and that greater hardship would be caused to the respondent if the decree of eviction is passed than that would be caused to the appellants if it is not passed.

5. The Prescribed Authority dismissed the application holding inter alia that the appellants are financially sound and other properties were available to them whereas except the suit shops the respondent does not have any place for residence and business and hence, if he is evicted from the  shops in his occupation, he will experience more difficulty.

The appeal carried from the said judgment was dismissed by the District Court holding inter alia that financial position of the appellants is far better than that of the respondent.

They could have purchased a vacant bungalow and started business for their sons. Learned District Judge held that the appellants have purchased the building to make profit and then filed the application for eviction. According to learned District Judge, the respondent was doing business from the said shops for many years and it would be difficult for him to find a place for business. Hardship caused to the respondent would be more.

6. While disposing of the petition filed by the appellants the High Court rightly held that the landlord cannot be dictated by the tenant what business his sons should do and the observations made by the courts below to that effect and the findings reached by the courts below on bona fide requirement of the landlord are perverse. However, without going into the aspect of comparative hardship, the High  Court directed that only one room out of the four rooms should be handed over to the appellants by the respondent as from the affidavit it appears that the respondent was using it as a passage. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellants have approached this Court.

7. Shri Vijay Hansaria, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants submitted that having come to the conclusion that the need of the appellants was genuine, the High Court erred in directing the respondent to only handover one room to the appellants. The High Court has wrongly granted only partial relief to the appellants without going into the aspect of comparative hardship. In support of his submissions, learned counsel relied on Raghunath G",,1
A.V. Padma & Ors.,"1. Leave granted.

2. The appellants were the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 10405/2008 which was dismissed by the High Court of Karnataka as per order dated 5.8.2008 which is impugned in this appeal.

Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein were respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 4 in the writ petition.

3. One T.S. Subrahmanyam met with a motor accident on 12.11.1991 and died on 21.7.1993 due to injuries sustained in the accident. Appellant No. 1 is the widow and appellant Nos.2 and 3 are the daughters of the said T.S. Subrahmanyam. In the claim petition  filed by the appellants who are the legal heirs of T.S. Subrahmanyam, the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal-I, Mysore (for short, ""the Tribunal"") passed an award granting Rs.60,000/- as compensation.

In appeal, the High Court of Karnataka vide its order dated 6.7.2006 enhanced the amount of compensation to Rs.4,25,000/-. Respondent No. 3 - United India Insurance Co. Ltd. deposited in the Tribunal an amount of Rs.6,33,038/- on 7.1.2008. On 31.1.2008, the appellants filed an application before the Tribunal praying for release of the amount in deposit in favour of appellant No. 1, A.V. Padma.

Appellants Nos. 2 and 3 filed affidavits stating that they had no objection to the payment of the amount to their mother A.V. Padma.

However, the Tribunal directed to invest Rs.1,00,000/- each in long term deposits in favour of appellant Nos. 2 and 3 and to disburse only the balance amount to the appellants. The appellants filed a further application dated 19.6.2008 praying to disburse the entire amount to the decree-holders without insisting on deposit of any portion of the amount in any nationalized bank. However, by an order dated 28.6.2008, the Tribunal rejected the prayer for release of the amount of Rs.2,00,000/- deposited in the nationalized bank. Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the appellants filed Writ Petition No. 10405 of 2008 in the High Court of Karnataka. The High Court dismissed the writ petition observing that the Tribunal had passed the impugned order keeping in mind the law declared by the Supreme Court in General Manger, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas and Others, AIR 1994 SC 1631.

According to the High Court, the Tribunal only followed the judgment of the Supreme Court in letter and spirit. Challenging the order of the High Court this appeal has been filed.

4. In the case of Susamma Thomas (supra), this Court issued certain guidelines in order to ""safeguard the feed from being frittered away by the beneficiaries due to ignorance, illiteracy and susceptibility to exploitation"". Even as per the guidelines issued by this Court Court, long term fixed deposit of amount of compensation is mandatory only in the case of minors, illiterate claimants and widows. In the case of illiterate claimants, the Tribunal is allowed to consider the request for lumpsum payment for effecting purchase of any movable property such as agricultural implements, rickshaws etc. to earn a living. However, in such cases, the Tribunal shall make sure that the amount is actually spent for the purpose and the demand is not a ruse to withdraw money. In the case of semi-illiterate claimants, the Tribunal should ordinarily invest the amount of compensation in long term fixed deposit. But if the Tribunal is satisfied for reasons to be stated in writing that the whole or part of the amount is required for expanding an existing business or for purchasing some property for earning a livelihood, the Tribunal can release the whole or part of the amount of compensation to the claimant provided the Tribunal will ensure that the amount is invested for the purpose for which it is demanded and paid. In the case of literate persons, it is not mandatory to invest the amount of compensation in long term fixed  deposit. The expression used in guideline No. (iv) issued by this Court is that in the case of literate persons also the Tribunal may resort to the procedure indicated in guideline No. (i), whereas in the guideline Nos. (i), (ii), (iii) and (v), the expression used is that the Tribunal should. Moreover, in the case of literate persons, the Tribunal may resort to the procedure indicated in guideline No. (i) only if, having regard to the age, fiscal background and strata of the society to which the claimant belongs and such other considerations, the Tribunal thinks that in the larger interest of the claimant and with a view to ensure the safety of the compensation awarded, it is necessary to invest the amount of compensation in long term fixed deposit.

5. Thus, sufficient discretion has been given to the Tribunal not to insist on investment of the compensation amount in long term fixed deposit and to release even the whole amount in the case of literate persons. However, the Tribunals are often taking a very rigid stand and are mechanically ordering in almost all cases that the amount of compensation shall be invested in long term fixed deposit. They are taking such a rigid and mechanical approach without understanding and appreciating the distinction drawn by this Court in the case of minors, illiterate claimants and widows and in the case of semi-

literate and literate persons. It needs to be clarified that the above guidelines were issued by this Court only to safeguard the interests of the claimants, particularly the minors, illiterates and others whose amounts are sought to be withdrawn on some fictitious grounds. The  guidelines were not to be understood to mean that the Tribunals were to take a rigid stand while considering an application seeking release of the money. The guidelines cast a responsibility on the Tribunals to pass appropriate orders after examining each case on its own merits.

However, it is seen that even in cases when there is no possibility or chance of the feed being frittered away by the beneficiary owing to ignorance, illiteracy or susceptibility to exploitation, investment of the amount of compensation in long term fixed deposit is directed by the Tribunals as a matter of course and in a routine manner, ignoring the object and the spirit of the guidelines issued by this Court and the genuine requirements of the claimants. Even in the case of literate persons, the Tribunals are automatically ordering investment of the amount of compensation in long term fixed deposit without recording that having regard to the age or fiscal background or the strata of the society to which the claimant belongs or such other considerations, the Tribunal thinks it necessary to direct such investment in the larger interests of the claimant and with a view to ensure the safety of the compensation awarded to him. The Tribunals very often dispose of the claimant's application for withdrawal of the amount of compensation in a mechanical manner and without proper application of mind. This has resulted in serious injustice and hardship to the claimants. The Tribunals appear to think that in view of the guidelines issued by this Court, in every case the amount of compensation should be invested in long term fixed deposit and under no circumstances the Tribunal can release the entire amount of  compensation to the claimant even if it is required by him. Hence a change of attitude and approach on the part of the Tribunals is necessary in the interest of justice.

6. In this case, the victim of the accident died on 21.7.1993. The award was passed by the Tribunal on 15.2.2002. The amount of compensation was enhanced by the High Court on 6.7.2006. Neither the Tribunal in its award nor the High Court in its order enhancing compensation had directed to invest the amount of compensation in long term fixed deposit. The Insurance Company deposited the compensation amount in the Tribunal on 7.1.2008. In the application filed by the appellants on 19.6.2008 seeking withdrawal of the amount without insisting on investment of any portion of the amount in long term deposit, it was specifically stated that the first appellant is an educated lady who retired as a Superintendent of the Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, Bangalore. It was also stated that the second appellant Poornachandrika is a M.Sc. degree holder and the third appellant Shalini was holding Master Degree both in Commerce and in Philosophy. It was stated that they were well versed in managing their lives and finances. The first appellant was already aged 71 years and her health was not very good. She required money for maintenance and also to put up construction on the existing house to provide dwelling house for her second daughter who was a co-

owner along with her. The second daughter was stated to be residing in a rented house paying exorbitant rent which she could not afford in  view of the spiralling costs. It was further stated in the application that the first appellant was obliged to provide a shelter to the first daughter Poornachandrika. It was pointed out that if the money was locked up in a nationalised bank, only the bank would be benefited by the deposit as they give a paltry interest which could not be equated to the costs of materials which were ever increasing. It was further stated that the delay in payment of compensation amount exposed the appellants to serious prejudice and economic ruin. Along with the application, the second and third appellants had filed separate affidavits supporting the prayer in the application and stating that they had no objection to the amount being paid to the first appellant.

7. While rejecting the application of the appellants, the Tribunal did not consider any of the above-mentioned aspects mentioned in the application. Unfortunately, the High Court lost sight of the said aspects and failed to properly consider whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there was any need for keeping the compensation amount in long term fixed deposit.

8. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the uncontroverted averments in the application of the appellants referred to above, we are of the view that the Tribunal ought to have allowed the prayer of the appellants. Hence the impugned orders of the Tribunal and the High Court are set aside.

The prayer in the application of the appellants for release of the  amount invested in long term deposits stands allowed. The entire amount of compensation shall be withdrawn and paid to the appellants without any further delay. The appeal is allowed in the above terms. There will be no order as to costs.",1,
Darshan Lal Nagpal (dead) by L.Rs.,"1. The questions which arise for consideration in this appeal are whether the Government of NCT of Delhi could have invoked Section 17(1) and (4) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, `the Act') and dispensed with the rule of hearing embodied in Section 5A(2) thereof for the purpose of acquiring land measuring 80 bighas 15 biswas including 21 bighas 3 biswas belonging to the appellants for a public purpose, namely, establishment of electric sub-station by Delhi Transco Limited (for short, `DTL') at village Mandoli and whether the Division Bench of the Delhi  High Court had rightly negatived the appellants' challenge to the acquisition of their land.

2. For deciding the aforesaid questions, it will be useful to notice the events which led to the issue of notification dated 13.10.2009 under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) and (4) of the Act and declaration dated 9.11.2009 under Section 6(1) of the Act.

2.1 It is not clear from the pleadings of the parties and the record produced before the High Court and this Court as to when the decision was taken to establish 400/220 KV sub-station at East of Loni Road but this much is evident that by a communication sent in August, 2004, the DTL requested the Delhi Development Authority (for short, `the DDA') for allotment of land. For the next about 10 months nothing appears to have happened. Between June and October, 2005 different functionaries of DTL made some correspondence inter- se in the matter of establishment of the sub-station. On 5/6.12.2005, Manager (400/220 KV SS&L) sent a communication to the Commissioner (Planning), DDA wherein he emphasized that establishment of the sub-station was necessary to meet the power demand of East Delhi and particularly the upcoming Commonwealth Games. In his reply dated 8.2.2006, Joint Director (MP), DDA informed the DTL that allotment of sites suggested by it is not  feasible because site `A' was developed as a park and site `B' was earmarked as a community centre.

2.2 Between January, 2006 and July, 2008, the officers of the DTL, the DDA and the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi exchanged letters on the issue of allotment of land for the sub-station. While the officers of DTL stressed the need for early allotment of land, the officers of the DDA repeatedly expressed their inability to allot the particular site by pointing out that the same was reserved for other purpose. On 28.07.2008, Secretary (Power), Government of NCT of Delhi-cum-CMD, DTL requested the DDA to change the land use of the particular site and inform the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi so that action could be taken for the acquisition of land under Section 17 of the Act. In that letter, it was also mentioned that due to paucity of land, the DTL has proposed to establish a GIS indoor type sub-station which could be accommodated in a space of about 200 x 125 meters as against the original requirement of 700 x 500 meters. The relevant portions of that letter are extracted below:

""In pursuance of above, a meeting was held with Vice- Chairman, DDA on 06.05.2008 wherein a request was made for the allotment of land in East Delhi. Officers of Delhi Transco Limited, State Transmission Utility, along with Officers of DDA and the concerned ADM of the area had identified the land in their joint inspection held on 30th June, 2008. Copy of Khasra Nos. and their Report is enclosed as Annexure-I. However, in the meantime DDA informed that  the land in question is not acquired by DDA. It was further informed that as per Master Plan, Agriculture/Green area can be utilized for Utilities. Copy of the letter No. F.6(4)2004/MP/D-127 dated 19.5.2008 is enclosed as Annexure-II. Since the establishment of the Grid Station is of paramount importance for strengthening the power supply in East Delhi, DDA is requested to change the land use and to inform GNCTD so that action be taken for acquisition of the same under Section 17, i.e., for the public utility. Earlier it was proposed to construct an outdoor 400/200 KV Grid Station but keeping in view the paucity and availability of land DTL has now proposed to establish a GIS indoor type sub-station which could be accommodated in a space of about 200 x 125 meters. It shall be appreciated if appropriate directions are issued to the concerned officers for doing the needful expeditiously.""
(underlining is ours) 2.3 After about one month, Joint Secretary (Power) sent communication dated 9.9.2008 to the Principal Secretary, Land and Building Department with the request that action may be initiated for the acquisition of the identified piece of land by invoking Section 17 of the Act. The relevant portions of that letter are extracted below:
""Hon'ble Prime Minister of India has laid the foundation for 1500 KV gas based power plant at Bawana on 24.03.2008 being constructed by Pragati Power Corporation Limited, a company owned by Govt, of NCT of Delhi in order to evacuate and utilize the generation from this plant for the benefit of Delhi, a study was conducted by Central Electricity Authority which has recommended the establishment of a 220 KV substation in East Delhi for evacuation of power.
Officers of Delhi Transco Limited along with officers of DDA and concerned ADM have identified the land measuring 200 M x 150 M in East Delhi for the proposed grid. Copy of Khasra Nos. and their report is enclosed at Annexure-1. Sketch showing broad location of the plot proposed to be acquired with Khasra Nos. of the proposed location is at Annexure-II. DDA has informed that the land in question is not acquired by DDA. However, as per Master Plan 2021, public utilities are permitted in all use zones. In this regard, a copy of Director (Planning) DDA letter dated 19.05.2008 is enclosed as Annexure-III. The proposed site has already been taken up with VC, DDA for change of land use (Annexure-IV).
The commissioning of 155 MW power plant at Bawana is scheduled before the Commonwealth Games in October-2010. Therefore, keeping in view the urgency involved, kindly initiate the process for acquisition of identified peace of land in East Delhi in favour of Department of Power, GNCTD as provided under section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act at the very earliest.""
(underlining is ours) Soon thereafter, the Land and Building Department sent letter dated 30.9.2008 to Additional District Magistrate-cum-Land Acquisition Collector (North-East) to send the following information/documents:
""1. Draft notification u/s 4, 6 and 17 along with the copy of Aks Sizra, field book etc.
2. Report after conducting Joint Survey.
3. 80% estimated compensation amount with Calculation Sheet."" 
2.4 After about six months, Deputy General Manager (Planning-I), DTL sent letter dated 6.3.2009 to Deputy Secretary (Land Acquisition) and informed him that land measuring 250 x 200 sq. mts. with approach road will be required to accommodate the proposed three voltage level equipment as against the requirement of 200 x 125 sq. mts. indicated in the earlier communications. The concerned officer also requested that the acquisition of 80 bighas 15 biswas land may be finalized as per the joint site inspection carried out on 12.01.2009.
2.5 On its part, the DDA sent letter dated 8.5.2009 to the Deputy Secretary (Land Acquisition) that a joint site inspection be carried out for finalization of the site. However, the latter sent communication dated 16.6.2009 to the DDA to issue NOC required for initiation of the acquisition proceedings. 2.6 In September, 2009, the Land and Building Department of the Government of NCT of Delhi prepared proposal for the acquisition of land measuring 200 x 125 sq. mts. by invoking Sections 4 and 6 read with Section 17(1) and (4) of the Act. This is evident from the notings recorded in paragraphs 56 to 61 and 63 to 65 of file bearing No. F.S(11)/08/L&B/LA, which are extracted below:

""56. A requisition was received from Joint Secretary (Power) Department of Power for acquisition of land measuring 200 x 125 Sq. m. identified in East Delhi for construction of 400 x 200 KV grid station (Village Mandoli) vide their letter No.  F.11(88)/2008/Power/2186 dated 09.09.2009 (P-6/C).
Accordingly, the ADM/LAC (NE) was requested for draft notifications and other revenue records vide letter dated 30.09.2008 (P-7/C).

57. The ADM/LC (NE) vide his letter dated 31.01.2009 (P- 28/C) forwarded draft notification u/s 4 & 6 (P-26 & 27/C) for acquisition of land measuring 80 Bigha 15 Biswa. Copy of Joint Survey Report (P-23/C), copy of Field Book (P-20/C), copy of Asks Sizra (P-19/C) and Calculation Sheet for estimated compensation amount (P-25/C).

58. The revenue staff scrutinized the draft notification and some discrepancies have been found. The report of revenue branch may be seen at page (P-5 & 6/N).

59. Accordingly, LAC (NE) was requested for clarification vide letter dated 2/3/09 (page-29/C). A clarification was given by LAC (NE) in aforesaid context and may be seen at P-32 to 39/C. Report of revenue branch may be seen at page 11 & 12/N. Letter dated 30/7/08 and 6/3/09 received from Delhi Transco Ltd. regarding change of proposal may be seen at P.30 and 31/C. Delhi Transco Ltd. has given the justification for the change of proposal regarding requirement of land, i.e., 80 Bigha 15 Biswa instead of 200 x 125 Sq.m.

60. Vide letter No.F.6(4)2004-MP/265 dated 7/9/09 Jt. Director (MP) DD has informed that DDA has no objection with respect to proposed location of land for establishing 400/200 KV ESS subject to compliance of the following conditions:-

a. Submission of a layout plan/location plan with description of the land under reference be submitted to ascertain the boundaries of the site.

b. Justification for an area of 6.8 hact. against 2.96 hact.

c. This is a Master Plan level utility for which change of land use will be processed after land is acquired.  d. Submission of transmission route alignment plan as the surrounding area is thickly populated.

e. The site shall not be used for any other purpose other than ESS.

61. As the matter is urgent and related to Commonwealth Games, if approved Hon'ble L.G. may be requested to kindly approve acquisition of land measuring 80 Bigha 15 Biswa as per the draft notifications placed opposite for acquisition of land for establishment of 400 x 200 KV sub-station in village- Mandoli and issuance of notification u/s 4 read with 17(4) and section 6 along with 17(1) of Land Acquisition Act, 1894.

63. May kindly see the proposal at page 21/N regarding acquisition of land measuring 80 Bigha 15 Biswa for construction of 400 x 200 KV grid station in village Mandoli. The proposal has been received from Power Department, Govt., of NCT of Delhi, which is available at page 6/C. It has been mentioned in the proposal that Hon'ble Prime Minister of India has laid the foundation stone for 155 MW gas based power plant at Bawana on 24-3-2008 which is being constructed by Pragati Power Corporation Limited, a company owned by Govt., of NCT of Delhi. It has been also mentioned in the proposal that to evacuate and utilize the generation from this plant for the benefit of Delhi, a study was conducted by Central Electricity Authority which has recommended the establishment of a 220 KV sub-station in East Delhi for evacuation of power. The Power Department has requested that the acquisition of the above said land may be proceeded with under the emergency provisions of the Land Acquisition Act because 1500 MW power at Bawana is scheduled to be commissioned before the Commonwealth Games, 2010.

64. The Land Acquisition Collector (N/E) has prepared a draft notification under section 4 & 6 (page 26 & 27/C) after conduction the Joint survey report along with concerned department and copy of the same is available at page 23/C along with relevant records. As per the joint survey available at page 22/C and 23/C it appears that entire land is laying vacant except to Bhattas (Brick Kiln) and boundary walls in 3 Khasras. 
The DDA has also provided no objection for acquisition subject to certain conditions as mentioned in letter dated 07-09-09, which is available at page 64/C.

65. From the proposal of the Power Department it is clear that land is required for valid public purpose and urgent need for acquisition of the land has also been justified by the Power Department. Therefore, if approved, Hon'ble Lt. Governor may kindly be requested to approve acquisition of land measuring 80 Bigha 15 Biswa as per the draft notification placed opposite for the public purpose namely for establishing 400 x 200 KV grid sub-station for Power Department in Village-Mandoli and issuance of notification u/s 4 read with 17(4) and section 6 along with 17(1) of Land Acquisition Act, 1894.""

2.7 The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi accorded his approval on 26.9.2009 in the following terms:

""I have gone through the records and requirement of Delhi Transco Ltd. for acquisition of land for Establishment of 400x200 kv station at village Mandoli and the draft notifications prepared by LAC (North-East). I am fully satisfied that the land measuring 80 Bigha 15 Biswa is urgently required for above purpose. In view of the urgency of the scheme, I order that the provisions of section 5A shall not apply and notifications under section 4 read with 17(4), 6 & 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 be issued immediately. Sd/-
Tejendra Khanna Lt. Governor Delhi 26.09.2009.""
3. In compliance of the direction given by the Lieutenant Governor, the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi issued notification dated 13.10.2009  under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) and (4) for the acquisition of 80 bighas 15 biswas land. The declaration issued under Section 6(1) was published vide notification dated 9.11.2009. By another notification of the same date, Land Acquisition Collector (North-East), Delhi was authorised to take possession of the land on the expiry of 15 days.

4. When the appellants learnt about the proposed acquisition of their land, they made a representation to the Member of the Legislative Assembly that as per Master Plan of Delhi-2021 only 29.6 bigha land was required for the sub-station and that barren land available in the area could be utilized for that purpose leaving out their land. The concerned Member of the Legislative Assembly forwarded the representation to the Government of NCT of Delhi on 28.4.2009 but the same did not yield the desired result and the notifications were issued under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) and (4) and Section 6(1) of the Act. Thereupon, the appellants filed Writ Petition No. 13376 of 2009 for quashing of notifications dated 13.10.2009 and 9.11.2009. The main plank of their challenge was that there was no urgency for the acquisition of land which could justify invoking of Section 17(1) and (4) of the Act. They pleaded that more than 4 years time spent in the correspondence exchanged between the DTL, the State Government and the DDA clearly shows that  there was no urgency in the establishment of the sub-station and the cause put forward by the DTL in 2008-2009, namely, the requirement of power for Commonwealth Games did not warrant invoking of Section 17(1) and (4) which resulted in depriving them of their property without being heard. The appellants further pleaded that the Lieutenant Governor had not applied mind on the issue of urgency and approved the proposal prepared by the Land and Building Department, Government of NCT of Delhi without satisfying himself that there was emergent need for the acquisition of land for the purpose for which the proposal had been initiated prior to August, 2004. The appellants also claimed that other parcels of land including waste land belonging to the public authorities and the Gaon Sabha were available, which could be utilized for establishing the sub-station but, without examining the feasibility of acquiring an alternative piece of land, the respondents arbitrarily deprived them of their property.

5. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi it was averred that with a view to provide power to the city of Delhi, 1500 MW gas based power plant was being constructed at Bawana by a Government owned company, viz., Pragati Power Corporation Limited; that the plant is  scheduled to be commissioned in a time-bound manner in October, 2010 before the commencement of the Commonwealth Games; that in order to evacuate and utilize the power generated from the new plant for the benefit of Delhi, the Central Electricity Authority recommended establishment of 220 KV sub-station in East Delhi; that after identifying the land in question the Power Department of Government of NCT of Delhi made a request for initiation of the acquisition proceedings on urgent basis; that on receipt of letter dated 9.9.2008, instructions were issued to the Land Acquisition Collector to conduct a joint survey, prepare a draft notification and also make calculation of 80 per cent of the estimated compensation and that after taking all the necessary steps, a note was put up before the Lieutenant Governor, who approved the proposal for the acquisition of land under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) and (4) and also to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section 5A of the Act. It was also pleaded that the beneficiary of the acquisition deposited a sum of Rs.9,27,11,840/- towards 80 per cent of the estimated compensation as required by Section 17(3A) of the Act, which was remitted to the Land Acquisition Collector for payment. In Para 11 of the counter affidavit it was averred that there is an urgent need  of the land for the purpose of construction of sub-station by the DTL in the larger public interest.

6. In a separate written statement filed on behalf of the DTL it was pleaded that decision was taken by the Government to establish 400 / 220 KV grid sub-station to meet the growing demand of power in Delhi and the establishment of the sub-station was approved by Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission vide order dated 16.6.2009. In paragraphs 5 to 7 of the counter affidavit of the DTL reference was made to the decision taken by the Government to construct 1500 MW Pragati III Power Plant at Bawana IPGCL; 2 x 490 MW Thermal Power Stations at Dadri and 1500 MW Thermal Station at Jhajjar and also to establish grid sub- stations for evacuation of power from different plants. According to the DTL, as per the Master Plan of Delhi-2021, the minimum land required for establishment of a conventional outdoor 400/220/66 KV sub-station is 60 acres but because of scarcity of land, it was decided to establish an indoor GIS sub-station and for that purpose 80 bighas land was required. It was also the pleaded case of the DTL that the appellants' land was identified after inspections carried out by the officers of the DDA, Land and Building Department, Land Acquisition Collector, Government of  NCT of Delhi and its own officers. In paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 of the counter affidavit of the DTL, the following averments were made:

""13. That proposed 400KV sub-station cannot be established in the 30 bighas of Gram Sabha land. The said Gram Sabha land does not fulfill the complete purpose of the answering respondent because 80 bighas are required for the establishment of the proposed sub- station. Further, the said Gram Sabha's land does not give any entrance / exit point towards State Highway. Therefore, the acquisition of the said Gram Sabha's land does not serve any purpose.
14. That Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission, which is a statutory body of Govt. of NCT of Delhi vide its letter No. F.17(51)/Engg./DERC/2009-10/1074 dated 16.6.2009 granted investment approval of scheme for supply testing and commissioning of 400/220/66KV GIS sub-station at East of Loni Road to the tune of Rs. 250.24 crores. The true copy of the letter dated 16.6.2009 is marked and annexed as Annexure - E.
15. Further the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. vide its letter dated 28.8.2009 addressed to the answering respondent emphasized on the urgency regarding the setting up and commission of the 400 KV sub-station East of Loni Road since the transmission line is being constructed for catering the additional load of Commonwealth Games, 2010 from 2 x 490 MW, NTPC Dadri Power Plant (under construction) and set the timeline of completion by June, 2010. It was further pointed out that location of Lone Road sub-station and coordinates of 400 KV switch yard gantry were urgently required for the completion of the survey work. the true copy of the letter dated 28.8.2009 is marked and annexed as Annexure - F. Therefore, it was a comprehensive scheme consisting of establishment of 400/220KV grid sub-station by the answering respondent whereas in feed i.e. 400 KV transmission line from Dadri Generating  Station upto the proposed grid sub-station at East of Loni Road.""
7. The Division Bench of the High Court noticed the correspondence exchanged between the DTL, the DDA and the Government of NCT of Delhi and proceeded to observe:

""The only argument made was that urgency was because of ensuing Common Wealth Games and since those have already concluded, the urgency as seized to exist. This is a myopic view of the requirement for such a project. No doubt, endeavour was to establish the sub-station before the Commonwealth Games, 2010 but that was not the only reason for urgency. The primary reason for urgency was, and continuous to be, that the substation in East Delhi is needed to evacuate and utilize the power generated from 1500 MW Gas based Plant at Bawana which is being constructed. The urgency was, and continuous to exist, i.e. the need for adequate power supply to the residents of this city. This is an urgent need keeping in view the wide gap between the demand and supply. No doubt, the plans were to commission it before Common Wealth Games. That has not happened also because of the reason that stay was granted in these proceedings. Be as it may, it cannot be argued that merely because Common Wealth Games are over, the respondent authorities can now set up the sub-station leisurely. These are the aspects which are to be gone into by the Competent Authority while exercising powers under Section 17 (4) of the Act. Once it is seen that all relevant factors were taken into consideration and the Competent Authority was not influenced by any irrelevant consideration or the power exercised was not the result of malafide, the subjective satisfaction of the Competent Authority, based on those objective considerations namely the purpose of invocation of urgency clause to acquire continued to exist the Court would be loathe to interfere with such discretion exercised by the Competent Authority dispensing  with the enquiry under Section 5A of the Act.""

8. The Division Bench of the High Court then referred to the judgments of this Court in First Land Acquisition Collector and Others v. Nirodhi Prakash Ganguli and Another, (2002) 4 SCC 160; Union of India & Others v. Praveen Gupta and Others (1997) 9 SCC 78; Nand Kishore Gupta and Others v. State of U.P. and Others (2010) 10 SCC 282 and of the High Court in Bijwasan Gram Vikas Samiti v. Lt. Governor and Others - WP(C) No. 1307/2010, decided on 5.10.2010 and negatived the appellants' challenge to the invoking of Section 17 of the Act. The Division Bench distinguished the judgments relied upon by the appellants' counsel by observing that those cases did not involve challenge to the acquisition of land for infrastructure projects meant for larger public interest. At the same time, the Division Bench referred to the judgments in Rajiv Joshi v. Union of India 2009 (159) DLT 214, Rajinder Kishan Gupta and another v. Lt. Governor, Government of NCT of Delhi 2010 (114) DLT 708, Sumit Import Services Ltd. and another v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and others 2008 (103) DRJ 263, M/s. A.B.Tools Ltd. and another v. Union of India WP (C) No.4611/1996, decided on 3.2.2010, Deepak Resorts v. Union of India 2008 (149) DLT 582, Ajay Kumar Sanghi v. Delhi Police 2009 (163)  DLT 74, Union of India and others v. Pramod Gupta (1997) 9 SCC 78, Sheikhar Hotels Gulmohar Enclave v. State of U.P. (2008) 14 SCC 716 and Jai Narain v. Union of India (1999) 1 SCC 9 in which the acquisition of land for Airport, construction of metro station/metro line, installation of LPG Bottling Plant, construction of sewage treatment plant, construction of police station, relocation of timber merchants outside the walled city and widening of National Highway by invoking the urgency provisions contained in Section 17 of the Act was upheld by the High Court and this Court.

9. Learned counsel for the parties reiterated the arguments made before the High Court. While Shri Dhruv Mehta relied upon the judgments of this Court in Anand Singh v. State of U.P. (2010) 11 SCC 242 and Radhy Shyam v. State of U.P. (2011) 5 SCC 553 to emphasize that the acquisition of land for establishment of 400/220 KV sub-station did not warrant invoking of the urgency provisions contained in the Act because the proposal for establishment of the sub-station was initiated more than five yeas prior to the issue of notification under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(1) and (4) of the Act and there was no justification to deprive the appellants of the right to be heard before being deprived of their property, Shri P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General argued  that the time consumed in the exchange of correspondence between the functionaries of the Government, the DTL and the DDA cannot be made a ground for nullifying the exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. In support of his argument, Shri Malhotra relied upon the judgments of Deepak Pahwa v. Lt. Governor of Delhi (1984) 4 SCC 308 and Chameli Singh v. State of U.P. (1996) 2 SCC 549. Shri Waziri, learned counsel for the DTL, supplemented the argument of learned Additional Solicitor General and submitted that the Court may not quash the acquisition of the appellants' land because the work for establishing the sub-station has been completed to a large extent. Learned counsel submitted that the appellants' land cannot be left out because the same is needed for construction of project road. Shri Waziri also submitted that the sub-station is required for evacuation of power which will be made available from the Dadri Power Plant and no other suitable land was available for the sub-station.",1,
Rameshbhai Dabhai Naika ,"1. Leave granted.

2. The question that once again arises before this Court is what would be the status of a person, one of whose parents belongs to the scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and the other comes from the upper castes, or more precisely does not come from scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and what would be the  entitlement of a person from such parents to the benefits of affirmative action sanctioned by the Constitution. The Gujarat High Court has proceeded on the basis that the issue is settled by the decisions of this Court in Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University and others, (1996) 3 SCC 545 followed by Punit Rai v. Dinesh Chaudhary, (2003) 8 SCC 204 and Anjan Kumar v. Union of India and others, (2006) 3 SCC 257. On the strength of those three decisions the High Court upheld the order passed by the Scrutiny Committee cancelling the tribal certificate earlier obtained by the appellant on the sole ground that his father was a non-tribal, belonging to the Hindu caste Kshatriya. The High Court did not advert to the fact that the mother of the appellant was undeniably a Nayak, one of the scheduled tribes and the appellant himself and his other siblings were also married to Nayaks. The High Court also did not refer to the evidences adduced by the appellant on the question of his upbringing as a member of the Nayak community and his acceptance in that community (or for that matter the contra evidence produced by the respondent  questioning his claim to be a member of the scheduled tribe). In view of the fact that his father was a non-tribal, the High Court deemed everything else as of no relevance and declined to record any finding on whether the appellant was, in fact, brought up as a tribal and, consequently, shared all the indignities and handicaps and deprivations normally suffered by the tribal communities.

3. The appellant, thus, lost his tribal certificate and the Fair Price shop that was allotted to him on that basis. He has now brought the matter to this Court making the grievance that the High Court order does not impact him alone but as a result of the order of the High Court his children too, though undisputedly born to a tribal mother, are bound to lose their tribal identity.

4. The High Court seems to have read the decisions in Valsamma Paul, Punit Rai and Anjan Kumar as laying down the rule that in all cases and regardless of other considerations the offspring of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal would take his/her caste from the father.  In the three decisions there are indeed observations (though by no means forming the ratio of the decisions) that may lend credence to such a view but the question is whether it can be said to flow from those decisions, as an inflexible rule of general application, that in every case of inter-caste marriage or marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, the offspring must take his/her caste from the father. The clear answer, to our mind, is in the negative. A careful examination of the three cases together with some other decisions of this Court would clearly show that what was said in Valsamma in a certain context has been rather mechanically and inappropriately extended and applied to different other fact situations as the law laid down in Valsamma.

5. Valsamma was a Syrian Catholic woman (forward caste) who married a Latin Catholic man (backward class) and the question arose whether by virtue of her marriage she was entitled to appointment to a post of lecturer that was reserved for Latin Catholics (Backward Class Fishermen). The full bench of the Kerala High Court held that though Valsamma was  married according to the Canon law, being a Syrian Christian by birth, she could not by marriage with a Latin Catholic become a member of that class nor could she claim the status of backward class by marriage. Dealing with the consequences of a woman marrying outside her caste the Court relied upon two old Privy Council decisions of the nineteenth century and came to hold that when a woman marries outside her caste, she becomes a member of the caste of the husband's family. In paragraph 31 of the judgment in Valsamma the Court said:

""It is well-settled law from Bhoobum Moyee Debia v. Ram Kishore Acharj Chowdhry (1865) 10 MIA 279: 3 WR 15 that judiciary recognized a century and a half ago that a husband and wife are one under Hindu law, and so long as the wife survives, she is half of the husband. She is `Sapinda' of her husband as held in Lulloobhoy Bappoobhoy Cassidass Moolchund v. Cassibai (1879-80) 7IA 212 . It would, therefore, be clear that be it either under the Canon law or the Hindu law, on marriage the wife becomes an integral part of husband's marital home entitled to equal status of husband as a member of the family. Therefore, the lady, on marriage, becomes a member of the family and thereby she becomes a member of the caste to which she moved. The caste rigidity breaks down and would stand no impediment to her becoming a member of the family to which the husband belongs and she gets herself transplanted.""
(emphasis added) 
6. Having said that in an inter-caste marriage the woman takes on the caste of her husband, the Court proceeded to consider the next question which was, ""whether a lady marrying a Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or OBC citizen, or one transplanted by adoption or any other voluntary act, ipso facto, becomes entitled to claim reservation under Article 15(4) or 16(4) as the case may be?"" This question the Court firmly answered in the negative and in paragraph 34 of the judgment observed and held as follows:-
""In Murlidhar Dayandeo Kesekar v. Vishwanath Pandu Barde 1995 supp. (2) SCC 549 and R. Chandevarappa v. State of Karnataka (1995) 6 SCC 309: JT (1995) 7 SC 93, this Court had held that economic empowerment is a fundamental right to the poor and the State is enjoined under Articles 15(3), 46 and 39 to provide them opportunities. Thus, education, employment and economic empowerment are some of the programmes the State has evolved and also provided reservation in admission into educational institutions, or in case of other economic benefits under Articles 15(4) and 46, or in appointment to an office or a post under the State under Article 16(4). Therefore, when a member is transplanted into the Dalits, Tribes and OBCs, he/she must of necessity also have had undergone the same handicaps, and must have been subjected to the same disabilities, disadvantages, indignities or sufferings so as to entitle the candidate to avail the facility of reservation. A candidate who had the advantageous start in life being born in Forward Caste and had march of advantageous life but is transplanted in Backward Caste by adoption or marriage or conversion, does not become eligible to the benefit of reservation either under Article 15(4) or 16(4),  as the case may be. Acquisition of the status of Scheduled Caste etc. by voluntary mobility into these categories would play fraud on the Constitution, and would frustrate the benign constitutional policy under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. ""
(emphasis added)
7. Proceeding further, in paragraph 35 of the judgment, the Court expressly held that acceptance by the community, a test that was earlier applied by the Court in cases of conversion and reconversion, would have no application to judge Valsamma's claim to the post reserved for Latin Catholics by virtue of her marriage in that caste.
8. The court, thus, gave two reasons for disallowing Valsamma, the benefit of reservation under Articles 15 & 16 of the Constitution; first, being born in a forward caste she had an advantageous start in life and she had not gone through the same disabilities, disadvantages, indignities or sufferings as other members of the backward class and secondly claiming the benefits of reservation by getting transplanted into a backward class by means of marriage, that is to say, through voluntary mobility would amount to a fraud on the Constitution. 

9. On a careful reading of the judgment it becomes clear that the ratio of the Valsamma decision lies in paragraph 34 of the judgment as quoted above. What was said earlier in paragraph 31 of the judgment was in the facts of that case and it would be an error to take it as the ratio of the decision. More importantly, it would be very wrong to take paragraph 31 of the Valsamma judgment as a premise for drawing the corollary or the deduction that the child born from an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal would invariably take his caste from the father. But before examining Valsamma in any greater detail it would be useful to see how it was used, applied and ""improved upon"" in later decisions of the Court.

10. Valsamma was a case of reservation under Articles 15 & 16 of the Constitution. A case of reservation of seats in the Legislative Assembly under Article 332 of the Constitution came to be considered by a three judge bench of the Court in Sobha Hymavathi Devi v. Setti Gangadhara Swamy & Others (2005) 2 SCC 244. The case of Sobha Hymavathi Devi, in certain aspects on facts, is very similar to Valsamma. The election of  Sobha to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from a constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes was challenged on the ground that she belonged to a forward community, Patnaik Sistu Karnam, and was, therefore, not qualified to contest the election from the constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes. Denying the allegations of the election petitioner Sobha raised three pleas; first, both her parents belonged to Scheduled Tribes; secondly, in case her father was held to come from a forward caste she was actually brought up by her mother, who undeniably belonged to a scheduled tribe, as a member of the tribal community and thirdly she married a Scheduled Tribe person and, therefore, became a member of the Scheduled Tribe. She had, therefore, the status of a Scheduled Tribe and was qualified to contest the election from the constituency reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. The Court examined Sobha's first and second pleas fully in light of the factual evidence and came to reject the two pleas on the basis of the findings of fact. Dealing with the second plea, in paragraph 8 of the judgment, the Court held and observed as follows:- 

""Elaborating her argument, learned counsel for the appellant contended that even though the appellant was born to Murahari Rao, a Sistu Karnam, she was still being treated as a member of the Bhagatha community to which her mother belonged and that she had married a person belonging to the Bhagatha community; that the Bhagatha community had always accepted her as belonging to that community and in such a situation, she must be considered to belong to the Bhagatha community, a Scheduled Tribe and hence eligible to contest from a constituency reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. That the appellant had married Appala Raju, her maternal uncle belonging to the Bhagatha community, is not in dispute. But the claim of the appellant that she was being brought up and was being recognised as a member belonging to the Bhagatha community, cannot be accepted in the face of the evidence discussed by the High Court including the documentary evidence relied on by it. The document Ext. 10 and the entry therein marked as Ext. X-11 relating to the appellant, show her caste as Sistu Karnam and not as Bhagatha. This entry was at an undisputed point of time. Moreover, the evidence also shows that she was always being educated at Vishakhapatnam and she was never living as a tribal in Bhimavaram village to which her mother's family belongs. There is no reason for us to differ from the conclusion of the High Court on this aspect.""
(emphasis added)
11. It was only then that the Court considered the third plea of Sobha that having married a person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe she had acquired membership of that community and consequently she must be treated as a member of the Scheduled Tribe. Dealing with this plea the Court referred to the decision in Valsamma and applied it to the case of reservation of a seat in the Legislative Assembly under Article 332 of the  Constitution. In Paragraph 10 of the judgment the Court held and observed as follows:-
""Even otherwise, we have difficulty in accepting the position that a non-tribal who marries a tribal could claim to contest a seat reserved for tribals. Article 332 of the Constitution speaks of reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Legislative Assemblies. The object is clearly to give representation in the Legislature to Scheduled Tribe candidates, considered to be deserving of such special protection. To permit a non-tribal under cover of a marriage to contest such a seat would tend to defeat the very object of such a reservation. The decision of this Court in Valsamma Paul v. Cochin University supports this view. Neither the fact that a non- backward female married a backward male nor the fact that she was recognised by the community thereafter as a member of the backward community, was held to enable a non-backward to claim reservation in terms of Article 15(4) or 16(4) of the Constitution. ...Thereafter, this Court noticed that recognition by the community was also important. Even then, this Court categorically laid down that the recognition of a lady as a member of a backward community in view of her marriage would not be relevant for the purpose of entitlement to reservation under Article 16(4) of the Constitution for the reason that she as a member of the forward caste, had an advantageous start in life and a marriage with a male belonging to a backward class would not entitle her to the facility of reservation given to a backward community. The High Court has applied this decision to a seat reserved in an election in terms of Article 332 of the Constitution. We see no reason why the principle relating to reservation under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) laid down by this Court should not be extended to the constitutional reservation of a seat for a Scheduled Tribe in the House of the People or under Article 332 in the Legislative Assembly.""
(emphasis added) 
12. What is of importance in Sobha Hymavathi Devi is that the Court did not take the fact that Sobha's father was a man of forward caste as conclusive of her caste status. The Court did not shut out the plea raised by Sobha that she must be considered as belonging to the scheduled tribe because her mother who was herself a tribal brought her up as a member of her community and raised her as a tribal even though her father might have come from a forward caste. On the contrary the Court examined the plea raised by Sobha in light of evidences adduced by the parties and negated it on the basis of a pure finding of fact. Though the Court referred to and approved Valsamma for rejecting Sobha's plea that she had acquired the status of a tribal by virtue of her marriage to a tribal man, it did not take Valsamma as an authority that in a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal, the caste of the father would be determinative of the caste of the child.
13. The third plea raised by Sobha in support of her being a tribal and the claim of Valsamma were both based on their voluntary action in marrying a tribal man. In both cases the  Court held that getting transplanted into the tribal community through voluntary mobility cannot be the basis for the Forward caste/non-tribal woman to avail of the benefits of reservation under Article 15 & 16 (in Valsamma) or under Article 332 of the Constitution (in Sobha Hymavathi Devi). But in neither of the two cases the question of a child born of an inter-caste marriage or a marriage between a tribal and a non-tribal was directly in issue.

14. This question came up directly for consideration in Punit Rai v. Dinesh Chaudhary (2003) 8 SCC 204. The election of Dinesh Chaudhary (the respondent in the appeal before this Court) to Bihar Legislative Assembly from a constituency reserved for scheduled castes was challenged on the ground that he was born to Kurmi parents and he did not belong to any scheduled castes. The respondent did not deny that his father Bhagwan Singh was a Kurmi and he was married to a Kurmi woman. He, however, set up the case that Bhagwan Singh had taken a second wife Deo Kumari Devi who was a Pasi (scheduled caste) and he was born to Deo Kumari Devi from  Bhagwan Singh and he was, thus, fully eligible to contest from the reserved constituency. He also relied upon a circular issued by the State of Bihar according to which a child born to a non- scheduled caste father and a scheduled caste mother would be counted in the category of scheduled caste. A three-judge bench of the Court before which the case came up for hearing handed down two separate, though concurring, judgments, one by Brijesh Kumar, J., speaking for himself and for V.N. Khare, CJ, and the other by Sinha, J. It is significant to note that the judgment by Brijesh Kumar,J. is based on the finding that the respondent failed to establish that Bhagwan Singh had taken a Pasi woman as the second wife and he was born to her from Bhagwan Singh. The Court held that the fact that Bhagwan Singh was a Kurmi and he was married to a Kurmi woman being admitted, the election petitioner had discharged the onus and the burden now lay upon the respondent to establish that Bhagwan Singh had married second time and his second wife was a Pasi who had given birth to the respondent and the respondent had completely failed to establish that. In paragraphs 14 and 15 of the judgment by the two judges it was  observed and held as follows:

""14. The case of the parties is clear from their pleadings and the evidence adduced by them as indicated above. The petitioner challenged the status of respondent Dinesh Chaudhary as a Scheduled Caste person belonging to the SC community. Precisely what was indicated in support of that case is that the father of Dinesh Chaudhary and Naresh Chaudhary is Bhagwan Singh who is Kurmi by caste married to Jago Devi, also a Kurmi lady. The High Court has also observed that a person born in a Kurmi family normally would be presumed that he is Kurmi by caste. In this background the initial burden of the petitioner would stand discharged and it would shift upon the respondent to prove his case which, in normal course of things, would be and is within his special knowledge. A case which has been set up by the respondent through his witnesses as well, that his father had taken a fancy to Deo Kumari Devi, a resident of Village Adai, who is Pasi by caste and married her, who gave birth to two children including the respondent, would normally be not in the knowledge of the people in general, particularly when according to the case of the respondent himself Jago Devi lived in another village and she was never brought from there by Bhagwan Singh. More so, when Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi by caste, is living with his wife Jago Devi, also a Kurmi, in their village Jehanabad. The best evidence, as also according to the High Court to prove the case of the respondent, was to produce Bhagwan Singh and Deo Kumari Devi but they have been withheld after being cited as witnesses for the respondent. These facts clearly make out a case for drawing an adverse inference that in case they had been produced they would not have supported the case of the respondent. Kundan Lal Rallaram v. Custodian, Evacuee Property AIR 1961 SC 1316, T.S. Murugesam Pillai v. M.D. Gnana Sambandha Pandara Sannadhi AIR 1917 PC 6 and Thiru John v. Returning Officer (1977) 3 SCC 540, may also be referred on the point.
15. ......Apart from the above, the appellant had also discharged his burden by proving the fact that the father of Respondent 1 is Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi by caste married to Jago Devi, also a Kurmi by caste. The natural inference in  such circumstances would be that the respondent would, in normal course of events, be a Kurmi by caste. If there is anything contrary to the normal course of events, as pleaded in this case, of another marriage of Bhagwan Singh in some other village, namely, Adai with Deo Kumari Devi who never came to live with Bhagwan Singh in his village nor Bhagwan Singh ever lived there. Such facts in the special knowledge of the respondent have to be proved by him alone. The respondent was under duty to prove his case both ways, namely, in view of the special knowledge of facts pleaded and again in view of the fact that the appellant had discharged his initial burden of showing that the respondent was Kurmi by caste being the son of Bhagwan Singh, a Kurmi married to Jago Devi, also a Kurmi. The other decision which has been referred to on behalf of the respondent is reported in Dolgobinda Paricha v. Nimai Charan Misra AIR 1959 SC

914. It in connection with the fact that the evidence of the brother of Deo Kumari Devi that Bhagwan Singh had married her, was relevant for the purposes of relationship of one person to another since the brother of Deo Kumari Devi, is a person who is a member of the family or otherwise has special means of knowledge of the particular relationship. The decision is in reference to Section 50 of the Evidence Act. It may be observed that the evidence of persons who belong to Village Adai including the brother of Deo Kumari Devi have been examined by the respondent to establish the allegation of marriage between Bhagwan Singh and Deo Kumari Devi. Undoubtedly, the evidence of the brother of Deo Kumari Devi would be relevant for the relationship between Bhagwan Singh and Deo Kumari Devi but his evidence would not be of any help, in view of the adverse inference drawn under Section 114(g) of the Evidence Act due to withholding of the best evidence available on the point. When the persons concerned are not coming forward to the Court to depose about the alleged relationship and an adverse inference has been drawn that if they had come to the Court to depose, their evidence would have gone against the respondent, in such circumstances, there is no occasion to act upon the statement of DW 5, the brother of Deo Kumari Devi or other witnesses.""

(emphasis added) 

15. Once again it is to be seen that the judgment by the two judges went into the facts of the case in detail and considered the effect of the evidences led (or rather not led!) by the respondent in support of his case. And again it was on a finding of fact that the Court held that the respondent failed to establish his scheduled caste status. The judgment by two judges, like the decision in Sobha Hymavathi Devi, did not proceed on the basis that the respondent would get his caste from his father and his father being admittedly Kurmi the respondent could not have a caste status other than Kurmi. The Court did not disallow the respondent from taking the plea that he was the child of a Pasi mother and, thus, belonged to a scheduled caste. But in that endeavour the respondent failed on a finding of fact.

16. It is equally important to note that the judgment by the two judges does not rule out the possibility of the child from an inter-caste marriage taking his/her caste status from the mother, if such a provision was made in a circular issued by the  Government and, in paragraph 7 of the judgment, made the following observations:-

""A person born in a Kurmi family, which details have been provided, would normally be taken to be a Kurmi by caste. But it is only in special circumstances, as may have been provided under a circular of the Government of Bihar, that the caste of the mother would be taken as the caste of the children, if she happens to be a Scheduled Caste, married to a non- Scheduled Caste.""
17. Sinha,J., the third member on the Bench wrote a separate, though concurring judgment. He applied the test of acceptance by the community for rejecting the respondent's claim that he qualified as a `Pasi' (scheduled caste). In paragraphs 33 and 34 of the judgment Sinha,J. observed as follows-

""33. In the instant case there is nothing on record to show that the respondent has ever been treated to be a member of the Scheduled Caste. In fact evidence suggests that he has not been so treated. He as well as his brothers and other members of his family are married to persons belonging to his own caste i.e. ""Kurmi"".
34.There was no attempt on the part of the respondent herein to bring on record any material to the effect that he was treated as a member of the ""Pasi"" community. Furthermore, no evidence has been brought on record to show that the family of the respondent had adopted and had been practicing the customary traits and tenets of the ""Pasi"" community."" 
Sinha, J., however, proceeded to make certain other observations and in paragraph 27 of the judgment he said as follows:-

""27. The caste system in India is ingrained in the Indian mind. A person, in the absence of any statutory law, would inherit his caste from his father and not his mother even in a case of inter-caste marriage.""
(emphasis added) And in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the judgment as under:-
""41. Determination of caste of a person is governed by the customary laws. A person under the customary Hindu law would be inheriting his caste from his father. In this case, it is not denied or disputed that the respondent's father belonged to a ""Kurmi"" caste. He was, therefore, not a member of the Scheduled Caste. The caste of the father, therefore, will be the determinative factor in absence of any law.""
Here there is no reference to Valsamma but the connection is obvious. It is only the next logical step to what was said in paragraph 31 of Valsamma. If as a result of inter-caste marriage the woman gets transplanted into the family of the husband and takes her husband's caste it would logically follow  that the child born from the marriage can take his/her caste only from the father. We shall presently consider the highly illogical consequences of this logical derivation but before that it needs to be noticed that Sinha, J. rejected the government circular also that provided that the caste of the mother might be taken as the caste of the child. In the same paragraph (41) Sinha,J. observed:
"" Reliance, however, has been placed upon a circular dated 3- 3-1978 said to have been issued by the State of Bihar which is in the following terms:
""Subject: Determination of the caste of a child born from a non-Scheduled Caste Hindu father and a Scheduled Caste mother.
Sir, In the aforesaid subject as per instruction I have to state for the determination of a child born from a non- Scheduled Caste father and a Scheduled Caste mother, upon deliberation it has been decided that the child born from such parents will be counted in the category of Scheduled Caste.
2. In such cases before the issue of caste certificate there will be a legible enquiry by the Block Development Officer, Circle Officer/Block Welfare Officer.""
42. The said circular letter has not been issued by the State in exercise of its power under Article 162 of the Constitution of India. It is not stated therein that the decision has been taken by the Cabinet or any authority authorized in this behalf in terms of Article 166(3) of the Constitution of India. It is trite that a circular letter being an administrative instruction is not a law within the meaning of Article 13 of the  Constitution of India. (See Dwarka Nath Tewari v. State of Bihar AIR 1959 SC 249).""
(emphasis added)
18. He, thus, rejected the circular issued by the State of Bihar as invalid and of no consequence. However, the judgment by the two judges, as seen above expressly acknowledged that in special circumstances, as may be provided in the Government Circular, the caste of the mother may be taken as the caste of the children. Therefore, the view taken by Sinha J. on the circular is clearly at variance with the judgment of the two Judges on that issue. On the question of the child inheriting the caste of the mother the judgment by the two judges is silent as the question did not arise for consideration in view of the finding of fact that the respondent's father, a kurmi, had not married the pasi woman. It is, therefore, difficult to clothe the observation by Sinha J. on this point with precedent value, especially in view of the fact that the question did not arise at all after the decision of the majority of two judges. Seervai in his Constitutional Law of India, Fourth Edition, pages 2669-2673  esp. Para 25.102 explains that a `decision' refers to the determination of each question of law which arose and was decided in that case. In Punit Rai's case, the question did not arise at all, and moreover, there was no majority concurrence on the question that a child inherits his caste from the father.
Thus, the concurring judgment of Sinha J. must be interpreted by reference to Paragraphs 33, 34 and 47 of the judgment, where the learned Judge concurs with the majority on the question of fact. The other observations in the concurring judgment cannot be said to constitute binding precedent.

19. The question of the status of a child born to a scheduled tribe mother from a forward caste father again came up before the Court in Anjan Kumar v. Union of India and others, (2006) 3 SCC 257. Anjan Kumar, was the son of a scheduled tribe mother and a Kayastha (forward caste) father. The question was whether he could be considered to belong to the scheduled tribe. On the facts of the case, the Court found that though the mother of the child indeed belonged to a scheduled tribe, the child was brought up in the environment of forward  caste community and he did not suffer any social disabilities or backwardness. In paragraph 6 and 7 of the judgment the Court observed as follows:-",1,
M.P.Rural Road Development Authority & Anr,"1. Leave granted.

2. The question which falls for consideration in this appeal is whether the provision of Madhya Pradesh Madhyasthan Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 (hereinafter, `M.P. Act') which statutorily provides for the parties to the Works Contract to refer all disputes  to the Arbitration Tribunal constituted under Section 7 of the Act will continue to operate in view of the provisions of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter `A.C. Act 1996') which is a Central Act, subsequently enacted.

3. The facts leading to the aforesaid controversy be noted first.

4. The appellant-Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority and Anr., impugning the judgment of the High Court dated 8.9.2010 in this appeal, entered into a `Works Contract' with the respondent for construction and maintenance of Rural Road Package No.1958, District Jhabua.

5. Clause 24 of the Contract contains the `Dispute Redress Mechanism' and Clause 24.1 of the same provides as under:

""24.1 If any dispute or difference of any kind what-so-ever shall arise in connection with or arising out of this Contract or the execution of work of maintenance of the Works thereunder, whether before its commencement or during the progress of Works or after the termination, abandonment or breach of the Contract, it shall, in the first instance, be referred for settlement to competent authority, described along with their powers in the Contract Data, above the rank of the Engineer. The competent authority shall, within a period of forty five days after being requested in writing by the Contractor to do so, convey his decision to the Contractor. Such decision in respect of every matter so referred shall, subject to review as hereinafter provided, be final and binding upon the Contract. In case the Works is already in progress, the Contractor shall proceed with the execution of the Works, including maintenance thereof, pending receipt of the decision of the competent authority as aforesaid, with all due diligence.""

6. Under the `M.P. Act' ""dispute"" has statutorily been defined under Section 2(d):

""2(d) ""dispute"" means claim of ascertained money valued at Rupees 50,000 or more relating to any difference arising out of the execution or non-execution of a works contract or part thereof""

7. ""Works Contract"" has also been defined under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act:

""2(i) works contract"" means an agreement in writing for the execution of any work relating to construction, repair or maintenance of any building or superstructure, dam, weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory, workshop, powerhouse, transformers or such other works of the State Government or Public Undertaking as the State Government may, by notification, specify in this behalf at any of its stages, entered into by the State Government or by an official of the State Government or Public Undertaking or its official for and on behalf of such Public Undertaking and includes an agreement for the supply of goods or material and all other matters relating to the execution of any of the said works""

8. ""Reference to Tribunal"" is statutorily provided under Section 7 of the M.P. Act:

""7. Reference to Tribunal - (1) either party to a works contract shall irrespective of the fact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause or not, refer in writing the dispute to the Tribunal.

(2) Such reference shall be drawn up in such form as may be prescribed and shall be supported by an affidavit verifying the averments.

(3) The reference shall be accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed.

(4) Every reference shall be accompanied by such documents or other evidence and by such other fees for service or execution of processes as may be prescribed.

(5) On receipt of the reference under sub-section (1), if the Tribunal is satisfied that the reference is a fit case for adjudication, it may admit the reference but where the Tribunal is not so satisfied it may summarily reject the reference after recording reasons therefor.""

9. From a perusal of Section 7, it is clear that the nature of the dispute between the parties in the instant case is covered by the definition under Section 2(d) read with Section 2(1). As such under Section 7 such a dispute has to be statutorily referred to Tribunal set up under the M.P. Act.

10. The case of the appellant is that in view of several breaches in Works Contract by the respondent, the appellant terminated the Works Contract and encashed the bank guarantee furnished by the respondent on 25.6.2008.

11. Thereafter, on 29.8.2008, the respondent submitted a representation to the appellant against the encashment of bank guarantee. Prior to that on 5.8.2008, respondent filed a Writ Petition No. 4491/2008 challenging the encashment of bank guarantee and the writ petition was disposed of with a direction that the bank guarantee may not be encashed till the disposal of the representation.

Thereafter, on 4.6.2009 the representation of the respondent was rejected after giving the appellant a personal hearing.

12. In the pending dispute, the respondent submitted additional claim on 24.2.2010 and requested the appellant to appoint an Arbitrator for adjudicating the dispute between the parties. On 24.4.2010, the appellant replied that Clause 25 of the Works Contract specifically provides for adjudication of disputes by the Arbitral Tribunal under the M.P. Act.

13. Then on 24.6.2010 respondent filed an application under Section 11 of A.C. Act 1996 for appointment of an Arbitrator before the High Court. On 8.9.2010, High Court allowed the application of the respondent and appointed an Arbitrator by placing reliance on a decision of this Court in Va Tech Escher Wyass Flovel Ltd. Vs. MPSE Board & another - Civil Appeal No. 3746 and 3747 of 2005.

14. In the case of Va Tech (supra), this Court after referring to both the M.P. Act and the A.C. Act 1996, held that the M.P. Act applies only where there is no arbitration clause and this Court further held that the M.P. Act stands impliedly repealed by the A.C. Act 1996 where there is an arbitration clause.

15. Facts in connection with the Va Tech (supra) were that Va Tech was awarded a works contract by the M.P. State Electricity Board and there was an arbitration clause in the agreement.

16. Va Tech filed an application under Section 9 of the A.C. Act 1996 which was rejected by the learned Additional District Judge and that order was also upheld by the High Court.

17. Then Va Tech filed a special leave petition before this Court. This Court noting the provision of Section 7 of the M.P. Act came to the aforesaid finding and ultimately held that the judgment of the High Court in Va Tech cannot be sustained and opined that application under Section 9 of A.C. Act 1996 is maintainable. The exact reasoning recorded by this Court in Va Tech is as follows:

""In our opinion, the 1983 Act and the 1996 Act can be harmonised by holding that the 1983 Act only applies where there is no arbitration clause but it stands impliedly repealed by the 1996 Act where there is an arbitration clause. We hold accordingly. Hence, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained and we hold that the application under Section 9 of the 1996 Act was maintainable.""
18. Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the Division Bench of this Court, while coming to the aforesaid finding, has not noticed the relevant provision of the M.P. Act as well as the relevant provisions of A.C. Act 1996 and as such the same judgment was rendered `per incuriam'.

19. Learned senior counsel further submitted that another Division Bench of this Court in a case in which the Presiding Judge was common with the Bench which rendered the Va Tech (supra) ruling almost in a situation identical with Va Tech issued notice and stayed the arbitration proceedings.

20. In another case a Division Bench of this Court presided over by the same learned Judge who gave the Va Tech ruling passed the following order:

""This petition has been filed against the judgment and order dated 11th March, 2011  passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior Bench in Arbitration Case No.4 of 2010.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on a decision of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 3746 of 2005 decided on 14th January, 2010.

We are of the opinion that the aforesaid decision is distinguishable because in the present case the arbitration clause itself mentions that the arbitration will be by the Madhya Pradesh Arbitration Tribunal. Hence, in this case arbitration has to be done by the Tribunal.

The Special leave petition is dismissed.""

21. Relying on these two subsequent orders in the instant case and in Ravikant Bansal vs. M.P. Rural Road Development Authority and Anr. - SLP(C) No.18867 of 2011, Mr. Venugopal, the learned senior counsel submitted that subsequent Division Bench presided over by the same learned Judge who gave the Va Tech ruling has not followed the ratio in the case of Va Tech.

22. The learned counsel said so to justify his contention that the decision in Va Tech (supra) was rendered per incuriam.

23. If this Court looks at Section 2(4) of A.C.

Act 1996, it will appear that Part-I of A.C. Act 1996, which is from Section 2 to Section 43, shall, except sub-section 1 of Sections 40, 41 and 43, apply to every arbitration under any other enactment for the time being in force where the arbitration was pursuant to an arbitration agreement except insofar as the provisions of this Part i.e. Part-I are inconsistent with the other enactment or with any other rule made thereunder.

24. Similar provision relating to statutory arbitration was also there in Section 46 of Arbitration Act, 1940. Section 46 is set out below:

""46. Application of Act to statutory arbitration - The provisions of this Act, except sub-section (1) of Sec. 6 and Secs.

7, 12, 36 and 37, shall apply to every  arbitration under any other enactment for the time being in force, as if the arbitration were pursuant to an arbitration agreement and as if that other enactment were an arbitration agreement, except in so far as this Act is inconsistent with that other enactment or with any rules made thereunder.

25. If this Court compares the provisions of the M.P. Act with A.C. Act 1996 then the Court finds that the provisions of M.P. Act are inconsistent with the provisions of A.C. Act 1996. The M.P. Act is a special law providing for statutory arbitration in the State of Madhya Pradesh even in the absence of arbitration agreement. Under the provisions of A.C. Act 1996 in the absence of an arbitration agreement, arbitration is not possible. There is also difference in the formation of arbitration tribunal as is clear from Section 2(1)(d) of A.C.

Act 1996. Again under A.C. Act 1996, arbitral tribunal is defined under Section 2(1)(d) as a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators. But under M.P.

Act such a tribunal is created under Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. And under the M.P. Act dispute has a special meaning as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of  the Act whereas dispute has not been defined under the A.C. Act 1996.

26. It is clear from its long title that the M.P.

Act provides for the establishment of a tribunal to arbitrate in disputes to which the State Government or a public undertaking [wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the State Government], is a party, and for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith. The structure of the tribunal under the M.P. Act is also different from the structure of a tribunal under the A.C. Act 1996. It is clear from Section 4 of the M.P. Act that the composition of tribunal and their qualification is statutorily provided which is set out below:

""4. Chairman and Members of Tribunal and their qualifications.-(1) Subject to sub-

section (2) and (3), the State Government may appoint a chairman and as many members to the Tribunal as it may consider necessary.

(1-a) The State Government may, in consultation with the Chairman, designate one of the Judicial Members as the Vice-Chairman who in the event of occurrence of any vacancy in the office of the Chairman  by reason of his death, resignation, leave or otherwise, shall during such vacancy, discharge the functions of the Chairman.

(2) No person shall be appointed as Chairman of the Tribunal, unless he is or has been a Judge of a High Court.

(3) No person shall be qualified for appointment as a member of the Tribunal, unless-

(i) he is or has been a District Judge of not less than seven years standing: or

(ii) he is or has been a Revenue Commissioner or has held a post equivalent to the rank of Revenue Commissioner for a total period of not less than five years, or

(iii)he is or has been:-




(a)    Chief   Engineer   in   the   service   of   the 

       State         Government          in         Public         Works, 

Irrigation or Public Health Engineering Department; or

(b) a Chief Engineer in the service of the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board; or

(c) a Senior Deputy Accountant General of the Office of the Accountant General, Madhya Pradesh, for a period of not less than five years.

Provided that in the case of clause

(iii), in exceptional circumstances, the State Government may, relax the prescribed minimum period of five years to three years.""

27. The term of office and salaries and allowances are also statutorily provided under Sections 5 and 6 of the M.P. Act. Section 8 provides for the procedure to be followed by the tribunal on receipt of reference and Section 9 provides for the Constitution of Benches and Chairman's power of distribution of business. Under Section 16(2) of the M.P. Act there is a time limit for giving the Award which is absent in A.C. Act 1996. Section 17-A of the M.P. Act confers inherent power on the Arbitral tribunal to make orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the tribunal. Section 17-B also provides for power conferred on the tribunal for correction of clerical or arithmetical mistakes. No such power is given to an arbitral tribunal under A.C. Act 1996.

Section 19 of the M.P. Act gives High Court the suo motu power of revision. The High Court has also been given the power of revision to be exercised on an application made by an aggrieved party within three months of the award. While doing so, the High Court  is to act like a revisional court under Section 115 of the CPC.

28. It is clear from the aforesaid enumeration of the statutory provision that under the M.P. Act the parties' autonomy in the choice of arbitral tribunal is not there.

29. In State of Madhya Pradesh and another vs. Anshuman Shukla - (2008) 7 SCC 487, this Court while referring to the M.P. Act and dealing with the nature of the arbitral tribunal constituted under the said Act held that the said Act is a special Act and provides for compulsory arbitration. It provides for a reference and the tribunal has been given the power of rejecting the reference at the threshold.

It also held that the M.P. Act provides for a special limitation and fixes a time limit for passing an award. It has also been held that Section 14 of the M.P. Act provides that the award can be challenged under special circumstances and Section  17 provides for finality of the award, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law relating to arbitration. All these features of the Act were pointed by this Court in Anshuman Shukla (supra) to show that there is inconsistency between the provisions of A.C. Act 1996 and those of the M.P. Act. In para 28 of the judgment, this Court while referring to the provisions of M.P. Act held:

""The provisions of the Act referred to hereinbefore clearly postulate that the State of Madhya Pradesh has created a separate forum for the purpose of determination of disputes arising inter alia out of the works contract. The Tribunal is not one which can be said to be a domestic tribunal. The Members of the Tribunal are not nominated by the parties. The disputants do not have any control over their appointment. The Tribunal may reject a reference at the threshold. It has the power to summon records. It has the power to record evidence. Its functions are not limited to one Bench. The Chairman of the Tribunal can refer the disputes to another Bench. Its decision is final. It can award costs. It can award interests. The finality of the decision is fortified by a legal fiction created by making an award a decree of a civil court. It is executable as a decree of a civil court. The award of the Arbitral Tribunal is not subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  The provisions of the said Acts have no application.""
(para 28, page 497 of the report)
30. It is clear, therefore, that in view of the aforesaid finding of a co-ordinate Bench of this Court on the distinct feature of an arbitral tribunal under the said M.P. Act the provisions of M.P. Act are saved under Section 2(4) of A.C. Act 1996. This Court while rendering the decision in Va Tech (supra) has not either noticed the previous decision of a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Anshuman Shukla (supra) or the provisions of Section 2(4) of A.C. Act 1996. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that the decision of this Court in Va Tech (supra) was rendered per incuriam.
31. This was the only point argued before us by the learned counsel for the appellant.

32. The principle of per incuriam has been very succinctly formulated by the Court of Appeal in  Young vs. Bristol Aeroplane Company, Limited reported in 1944 (1) K.B. 718.

33. Lord Greene, Master of Rolls formulated the principles on the basis of which a decision can be said to have been rendered `per incuriam'. The principles are:

""Where the court has construed a statute or a rule having the force of a statute its decision stands on the same footing as any other decision on a question of law, but where the court is satisfied that an earlier decision was given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or a rule having the force of a statute the position is very different. It cannot, in our opinion, be right to say that in such a case the court is entitled to disregard the statutory provision and is bound to follow a decision of its own given when that provision was not present to its mind. Cases of this description are examples of decisions given per incuriam.""
(Page 729)
34. The decision in Young (supra) was subsequently approved by the House of Lords in Young vs. Bristol Aeroplane Company, Limited reported in 1946 Appeal Cases 163 at page 169 of the report.
35. Lord Viscount Simon in the House of Lords expressed His Lordship's agreement with the views expressed by the Lord Greene, the Master of Rolls in the Court of Appeal on the principle of per incuriam (see the speech of Lord Viscount Simon at page 169 of the report).

36. Those principles have been followed by the Constitution Bench of this Court in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited vs. The State of Bihar and others reported in 1955 (2) SCR 603 [See the discussion in pages 622 and 623 of the report].

37. The same principle has been reiterated by Lord Evershed, Master of Rolls, in Morelle Ld. vs. Wakeling & another [(1955) 2 QB 379 at page 406].

The principle has been stated as followed:

""...As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per incuriam are those of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some  inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned; so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that account, to be demonstrably wrong.......""
(page 406)
38. In the case of State of U.P. and another vs. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and another reported in (1991) 4 SCC 139, this Court held the doctrine of `per incuriam' in practice means `per ignoratium' and noted that English Courts have developed this principle in relaxation of the rule of stare decisis and referred to the decision in the case of Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. (supra). The learned Judges also made it clear that the same principle has been approved and adopted by this Court while interpreting Article 141 of the Constitution (see para 41).
39. In the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur reported in (1989) 1 SCC 101, a three-

Judge Bench of this Court explained this principle  of per incuriam very elaborately in paragraph 11 at page 110 of the report and in explaining the principle of per incuriam the learned Judges held:

""......A decision should be treated as given per incuriam when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute or of a rule having the force of a statute.......""
40. In paragraph 12 the learned Judges observed as follows:

""......One of the chief reasons for the doctrine of precedent is that a matter that has once been fully argued and decided should not be allowed to be reopened. The weight accorded to dicta varies with the type of dictum. Mere casual expressions carry no weight at all. Not every passing expression of a judge, however eminent, can be treated as an ex cathedra statement, having the weight of authority.""
41. Following the aforesaid principles, this Court is constrained to hold that the decision in Va Tech (supra), having been rendered in per incuriam, cannot be accepted as a precedent to decide the controversy in this case.

42. In reply the learned counsel for the respondent only submitted that the M.P. Act is repugnant to A.C. Act 1996 since the same is a later Act made by Parliament. The learned counsel referred to the provisions of Article 254 of the Constitution. The learned counsel also urged that in view of the provision of Section 85 of A.C. Act 1996, the M.P. Act stands impliedly repealed.

43. The said argument cannot be accepted. The provision for repeal under Section 85 of A.C. Act 1996 does not show that there is any express repeal of the M.P. Act. Apart from that the provision of Section 2(4) of A.C. Act clearly militates against the aforesaid submissions.

44. The argument of repugnancy is also not tenable. Entry 13 of the Concurrent List in the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution runs as follows:

""13. Civil procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the commencement of this Constitution, limitation and arbitration.""
45. In view of the aforesaid Entry, the State Government is competent to enact laws in relation to arbitration. The M.P. Act of 1983 was made when the previous Arbitration Act of 1940 was in the field.

That Act of 1940 was a Central Law. Both the Acts operated in view of Section 46 of 1940 Act.

46. The M.P. Act 1983 was reserved for the assent of the President and admittedly received the same on 17.10.1983 which was published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette Extraordinary dated 12.10.1983. Therefore, the requirement of Article 254(2) of the Constitution was satisfied. Thus, M.P. Act of 1983 prevails in the State of Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, A.C. Act 1996 was enacted by Parliament repealing the earlier laws of arbitration of 1940. It has also been noted that A.C. Act 1996 saves the provisions  of M.P. Act 1983 under sub-sections 2(4) and 2(5) thereof. Therefore, there cannot be any repugnancy.

(See the judgment of this Court in T. Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe and another reported in AIR 1983 SC

150). In this connection the observations made by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of M. Karunanidhi vs. Union of India and another reported in (1979) 3 SCC 431 are very pertinent and the following observations are excerpted:

""......It is, therefore, clear that in view of this clear intention of the legislature there can be no room for any argument that the State Act was in any way repugnant to the Central Acts. We have already pointed out from the decisions of the Federal Court and this Court that one of the important tests to find out as to whether or not there is repugnancy is to ascertain the intention of the legislature regarding the fact that the dominant legislature allowed the subordinate legislature to operate in the same field pari passu the State Act.""
(para 37, page 450)
47. It is clear from the aforesaid observation that in instant case the latter Act made by the Parliament i.e. A.C. Act 1996 clearly showed an  intention to the effect that the State Law of Arbitration i.e. the M.P. Act should operate in the State of Madhya Pradesh in respect of certain specified types of arbitrations which are under the M.P. Act 1983. This is clear from Sections 2(4) and 2(5) of A.C. Act 1996. Therefore, there is no substance in the argument of repugnancy and is accordingly rejected.
48. Therefore, appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court which is based on the reasoning of Va Tech (supra) is set aside. This Court holds the decision in Va Tech (supra) has been rendered in per incuriam. In that view of the matter the arbitration proceeding may proceed under M.P. Act of 1983 and not under A.C. Act 1996.

49. There will be no order as to costs.

(ASOK KUMAR GANGULY) New Delhi  January 24, 2012  REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.974 OF 2012 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.907/2011) M.P.Rural Road Development Authority & Anr. ...Appellant(s)

- Versus -

M/s. L.G. Chaudhary Engineers & Cont. ...Respondent(s) J U D G E M E N T Gyan Sudha Misra, J.

Leave granted.

2. While concurring and endorsing the reasonings assigned in the judgement of learned Justice Ganguly, I propose to add and thus partly dissent on certain aspects involved in the instant appeal which would have a bearing on the relief granted to the respondent by the High Court which appointed an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for adjudication of the dispute in regard to cancellation of the works contract between the contesting parties therein.

3. In this context, Section 7 of the Madhya Pradesh Madhyasthan Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 (hereinafter referred to as the `M.P. Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1983') needs to be reiterated which itself lays down as follows:

""Reference to Tribunal"" - (1) either party to a works contract shall irrespective of the fact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause or not, refer in writing the dispute to the Tribunal.""
4. On perusal of the aforesaid provision enumerated under Section 7, it is explicitly clear that the matter in the event of existence of a dispute between the parties in certain categories of cases where the State of Madhya Pradesh is a contracting party, the dispute shall be referred in writing to the tribunal irrespective of the fact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause or not. From this provision it is clearly apparent that reference of any dispute to the tribunal postulates an existence of a works contract and the definition of `works contract' under Section 2 (i) of the M.P. Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1983, it has clearly and unequivocally been specified as to what is a `works contract' in relation to which the dispute is required to be referred in writing to the tribunal. We may therefore meticulously recollect the definition of `works contract' which lays down as follows:-

""works contract"" means an agreement in writing for the execution of any work relating to construction, repair or  maintenance of any building or superstructure, dam, weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory workshop, powerhouse, transformers or such other works of the State Government or Public Undertaking as the State Government may, by notification, specify in this behalf at any of its stages, entered into by the State Government or by an official of the State Government or Public Undertaking or its official for and on behalf of such Public Undertaking and includes an agreement for the supply of goods or material and all other matters relating to the execution of any of the said works.""
5. Thus on a perusal of the definition of `works contract', it is manifestly clear that while the `works contract' means an agreement pertaining to matters relating to the execution of any of the work enumerated in the definition of `works contract', the same does not include the dispute pertaining to termination, cancellation or repudiation of works contract and the entire nature of transaction laid down therein relates to disputes which arise out of execution of the nature of work specified in the `works contract'. However, the question whether the `works contract' has been legally repudiated and rightly cancelled or not is the question or dispute pertaining to termination of works contract has not been incorporated even remotely within the definition of `works contract'. In view of this, the legal and logical consequence which can be reasonably drawn from the definition of `works contract' would be, that if there is a dispute between the contracting parties for any reason relating to works contract which include execution of any work, relating to construction, repair or maintenance of any building or super-structure,  dam, weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory, workshop, power house, transformers or such other works of the State Government or Public Undertaking including an agreement for the supply of goods or material and all other matters relating to the execution of any of the said works, the same would fall within the ambit of the definition of `works contract' and hence all disputes pertaining or arising out of execution of the works contract will have to be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal as envisaged under Section 7 of the Act of 1983. Hence, in addition to the reasons assigned in the judgment and order of learned Brother Justice Ganguly, disputes arising out of execution of works contract has to be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal and not under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

6. But in so far as the instant matter is concerned, the facts disclose that the appellant M.P. Rural Road Development Authority cancelled the works contract itself which was executed in favour of the respondent. In that event, the works contract between the parties was not in existence at all which would operate as a statutory mandate for reference of the dispute to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal.

7. It is no doubt true that if the matter were before an Arbitrator appointed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for adjudication of any dispute including the question regarding the justification and  legality as to whether the cancellation of works contract was legal or illegal, then the said Arbitrator in view of the ratio of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Maharshi Dayanand University & Anr. Vs. Anand Co-op L(C) Society, 2007 (5) SCC 295, as also in view of the persuasive reasoning assigned in the judgment and order reported in Heyman & Anr.

Vs. Darwins, Limited, 1942 (1) All E.R. 337 would have had the jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute regarding the justification and legality of cancellation of works contract also. But the same cannot be allowed to be raised under the M.P. Act of 1983 since the definition of `works contract' unambiguously lays down in explicit terms as to what is the nature and scope of `works contract' and further enumerates the specific nature of disputes arising out of the execution of works contract which would come within the definition of a `works contract'.

8. However, the same does not even vaguely include the issue or dispute arising out of cancellation and termination of contract due to which this question, in my considered opinion, would not fall within the jurisdiction of M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal so as to be referred for adjudication arising out of its termination. As already stated, fall out certainly would be otherwise if the matter were to be adjudicated by an Arbitrator appointed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and that would be in view of the ratio of the decisions of the Supreme Court  referred to hereinbefore which has held it permissible for the Arbitrator to adjudicate even the dispute arising out of cancellation or termination of an agreement or contract. This however, cannot be allowed to broaden or expand the ambit and scope of the M.P. Act of 1983 where the State Legislature has passed a specific legislation in respect of certain specified types of arbitration determining as to what are the nature of disputes to be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal and that specifically permits the reference of dispute arising out of execution of contract but clearly leaves out any dispute arising out of termination, cancellation or repudiation of `works contract'. In order to clarify the point further, what needs to be emphasized is that if the nature of dispute referred to the Arbitrator like the instant matter, related to a dispute pertaining to construction, repair, maintenance of any building super-

structure, dam or for the reasons stated within the definition of `works contract', the matter may be referred to the M.P. Tribunal in view of the fact that if there is a dispute in relation to execution of a works contract, then irrespective of the fact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause or not, the dispute is required to be referred to the M.P.

State Arbitration Tribunal for adjudication. But when the contract itself has been terminated, cancelled or repudiated as it has happened in the instant case, then the nature of dispute does not fall within the definition of `works contract' for the sole reason that it does not include any dispute  pertaining to cancellation of a works contract implying that when the works contract itself is not in existence by virtue of its cancellation, the dispute cannot be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal but may have to be decided by an Arbitrator appointed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

9. Hence, the nature of the dispute which falls within the definition of `works contract' under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act, 1983 and one of the contracting parties to the agreement is the State of M.P., then irrespective of an arbitration agreement the dispute will have to be referred to the Tribunal in terms of Section 7 of the Act of 1983. But if the works contract itself has been repudiated and hence not in existence at all by virtue of its cancellation/termination, then in my considered view, the dispute will have to be referred to an independent arbitrator to be appointed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 since the M.P.

Act 1983 envisages reference of a dispute to the State Tribunal only in respect of certain specified types of arbitration enumerated under Section 2 (i) of the M.P. Act, 1983.

10. As a consequence and fall out of the aforesaid discussion, the impugned order of the High Court by which the dispute relating to termination of works contract by the M.P. Rural Road Development Authority itself was referred to an independent arbitrator appointed by the  High Court under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 needs to be sustained and there is no need for a de novo reference of the dispute to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal. In the alternative, the consequence would have been otherwise and the matter could have been referred to the State Arbitration Tribunal if the dispute between the parties related to any dispute emerging out of execution of works contract which could fall within the definition of `works contract' given out within the definition of `works contract' under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act of 1983. In order to avoid any ambiguity, it is reiterated that in view of cancellation of the works contract itself which is the position in the instant case, the proceedings before the Arbitrator appointed by the High Court cannot be treated as non-est so as to refer the same once again to the tribunal for adjudication as the dispute does not emerge or pertain to execution of works contract but relates to non-existence of works contract by virtue of its cancellation.

11. Thus the sum and substance of what I wish to emphasize is that the question as to whether the dispute would be referred to the M.P.

Tribunal in terms of Section 7 of the M.P. Act of 1983 or to an independent arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 will depend upon the factum whether the works contract is existing between the parties or not out of which the dispute has arisen. In case, the works  contract itself has been repudiated/cancelled, then, in view of its non-

existence, Section 7 of the M.P. Act pertaining to reference of dispute to tribunal would not come into play at all by virtue of the fact that the dispute relating to execution of works contract alone can be referred to the tribunal in view of the specific nature of works contract enumerated within the definition of works contract under the Act of 1983. However, when the works contract itself becomes non-existent as a consequence of its cancellation, the matter will have to be referred to an independent arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and not to M.P.

State Arbitration Tribunal.

12. Thus, while holding that the M.P. Act 1983 should operate in the State of M.P. in respect of certain specified types of arbitration, the appointment of an independent arbitrator by the High Court under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 needs to be sustained since the works contract itself is not in existence by virtue of its cancellation and hence this part of the dispute could not have been referred to the M.P.

State Tribunal.",5,
Madhu ,"1. The appellant herein, Madhu Kalikutty Panicker (hereinafter referred to as ""Madhu"") was charged along with Sibi Bhaskaran (hereinafter referred to as ""Sibi"") for offences punishable under Section 302 and 392 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, for having robbed Padmini Devi alias Omana of her gold ornaments and thereafter having murdered her on 8.5.1998 at her residence, i.e., Kalathil House situated in Ward No.IV of Veliyanad Village. Both Madhu (accused no.1) and Sibi (accused no.2) were also residing in the neighbourhood of the deceased in the same ward and village.

2. The Sessions Judge, Alappuzha convicted the accused and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/- under Section 392 of the Indian Penal Code. The accused were sentenced to imprisonment for life under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.  The Sessions Judge directed that the aforesaid sentences would be suffered successively, i.e., one after the other. In case of default of payment of fine, the accused were to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years. The Sessions Judge also directed that the accused would be entitled to set off equivalent to the period of their detention during the course of trial, under Section 428 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

3. On appeal, the High Court of Kerala maintained the conviction of the two accused. On the question of sentence, the High Court modified the order passed by the Sessions Judge to the extent that the sentences would run concurrently. Subject to the aforesaid modification, even the sentences awarded by the Sessions Court were maintained.

4. The conviction of the accused at the hands of the Sessions Judge as also the High Court was based on circumstantial evidence. Principally, the conviction was ordered as a consequence of recovery of ornaments worn by the deceased, pursuant to the information furnished by the accused. Based on the aforesaid recovery, the High Court, relying on Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act inferred that the accused had committed the murder of Padmini Devi, and thereupon, robbed her off the ornaments worn by her. The only other material evidence taken into consideration by the courts below, to return the conviction of the appellant herein (as also his co-accused Sibi) was the factum of their having been sighted close to the place of occurrence at or around the time of occurrence.

5. The care and caution with which circumstantial evidence has to be evaluated stands recognized by judicial precedent. Only circumstantial evidence of a very high order can satisfy the test of proof in a criminal prosecution. In a case resting on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution must establish a complete unbroken chain of events leading to the determination that the inference being drawn from the evidence is the only inescapable conclusion. In the absence of convincing circumstantial evidence, an accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt. During the course of deliberations of the present controversy, we shall endeavour to evaluate the worthiness of circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. But more importantly, our endeavour would be to evaluate the admissibility of the statements made by the accused to the police, during the course of their detention by the police, resulting in the discovery of the gold ornaments, belonging to Padmini Devi, after having committed her murder. This piece of evidence has been relied upon to connect the accused with the crime.

6. The prosecution case as is revealed from the charge-sheet, notices that the accused with the deliberate intention of committing the murder of Padmini Devi with the motive of robbing her of the ornaments worn by her, proceeded to Kalathil House where the deceased was residing. Padmini Devi was found alone, sitting on the ghat (place leading into water) steps leading to the paddy field, washing utensils. The ghat was situated at about 3 meters (2 meters and 75 cms.) from the last door step of the kitchen's eastern door of Padmini Devi's house (Kalathil House). It is alleged that Madhu - accused no.1, caught hold of  the plated hair and neck of Padmini Devi and Sibi-accused no.2, held her by her feet, and the two together forcibly dragged her into the water. Thereupon, they suffocated her. The act of drowning of Padmini Devi is alleged to have been committed by the accused at a place 29 meters from the south-east of the steps of the ghat. The accused are stated to have dragged Padmini Devi to the spot from where her body was eventually recovered, at a distance of 7 meters north- west of the foundation of the Snake God Shrine, which is to the south of the paddy field in question. Madhu-accused no.1, is alleged to have removed six gold bangles worn by Padmini Devi (on her left arm), whereas, Sibi-accused no.2, is alleged to have removed a gold chain worn by Padmini Devi (around her neck). The accused were thus alleged to have committed the murder of Padmini Devi, and the theft of her ornaments jointly.

7. The son of the deceased Asuthosh PW3 is stated to have received a phone call from his sister Ambily PW4 at 9.45 p.m. on 8.5.1998. Since Ashutosh's sister Ambily informed him that she would like to speak to her mother Padmini Devi, Ashutosh PW3 who was sleeping at the time when the call was received, got up to call his mother. He found his mother missing. He accordingly, approached his relations and neighbours. A joint search was carried out. The husband of the deceased, i.e., Ayyappa Kurup PW2 who, at that point of time, was attending to his night duty in the Telephone Exchange at Changanacherry was summoned. Ayyappa Kurup PW2 reached Kalathil House at around 11.30 p.m. The body of the deceased was found at about 11.45 p.m., from under the water in the field on the eastern side of Kalathil House. Ayyappa  Kurup PW2 asked Purushottama Kurup PW1 to make a complaint to the police. This decision was in fact, that the death of Padmini Devi was shrouded in suspicious circumstances. The aforesaid suspicion emerged on account of absence of her golden necklace (worn by the deceased on her neck), as also, six bangles (worn by the deceased around her left arm) when her body was recovered. Accordingly, Purushothama Kurup PW1 reported the matter to the police, disclosing the aforesaid factual position on the following morning i.e. on 9.5.1998 at 8.30 a.m..

8. On the registration of the FIR, PJ Thomas PW21, Circle Inspector of Police, reached the place of occurrence, and prepared the inquest report (Exhibit P-3). As per the inquest report. the deceased Padmini Devi alias Omana was aged 47 years. She was found by Karthikeyan Nair PW16, a neighbour and a resident of Thundiyil House in Ward No.IV, Veliyanad Village at 11.45 p.m. from the paddy field on the eastern side of his house. As per the inquest report, Padmini Devi was last seen alive at her residence by her son Aushutosh at 9.15 p.m. on 8.5.1998. As per the inquest report, apart from the dress worn by her she was wearing a gold chain around her neck of ""thara"" fashion weighing about 5-1/2 sovereigns, besides 4-5 golden bangles in her left hand and golden earrings in her ears, when Aushutosh saw her for the last time. The inquest report further depicts, that blood and water was oozing out from her nostrils on both sides, and her tongue was protruding out by = inch, with the mouth slightly open. Water weeds were found sticking to her hair. Ears had earrings of ""claver"" design. The stomach was found to be slightly bloated. The inquest report  records, that at a distance of 2 meter 27 cm. of the first foot-step of the kitchen door, there is a ghat (place leading into water) with three steps. The lower step of the ghat is immersed in water. At a distance of 50 cms., from the lowest foot- step the water is 75 cms. deep. The spot in the field from where the dead body of Padmini Devi was recovered, was 29 meters from the lowest foot-step. The depth of the water at the place from where the dead body was recovered is stated to be 82 cms. deep (32.28 inches, i.e., about 3 feet). The inquest report also noted, that ornaments worn around the neck and in the left arm by Padmini Devi were missing. According to the statement of Aushutosh PW3, his mother must have gone to the ghat, fallen into the water and somehow died. Yet, consequent upon the discovery of the missing golden ornaments, those present at the spot at the time of preparation of the inquest report, expressed doubts about the death of Padmini Devi. Accordingly, even though at Serial no.XI of the inquest report, it stands recorded that Padmini Devi alias Omana had died due to drowning, at Serial no.XVI it was mentioned that since the ornaments worn by her were missing, the persons present had unanimously raised a doubt about the cause of her death.

9. The contents of the First Information Report, as also, the Inquest Report constituted the first factual depiction of an occurrence. These are of utmost importance. The evidence produced by the prosecution during the course of trial, will accordingly have to be evaluated along with the aforesaid reports conjointly to substantiate the credibility of the charges levelled against the accused. During the course of hearing, some salient facts which constituted the foundation for  establishing the prosecution version emerged. The first and the foremost in the sequence of events, is the fact that Padmini Devi is alleged to have gone to the steps of the ghat after having taken supper, for washing utensils. The second important feature of the prosecution story is the absence of a gold necklace from around the neck of Padmini Devi, and six gold bangles worn by her on her left arm. Gold earrings worn by the deceased Padmini Devi were found intact on her ears. The third facet is the factum of the state of body of deceased Padmini Devi. The prosecution version is that Padmini Devi was first smothered and thereafter drowned. Thereby inferring murder, as against death by accidental drowning. The fourth component of the prosecution case was the presence of Madhu-accused no.1 and Sibi-accused no.2 in the vicinity of the place of occurrence at or around the time of occurrence on the fateful day i.e., on 8.5.1998. The final and the clinching basis for establishing the guilt of the accused were the confessional statements made by Madhu-accused no.1, i.e., the appellant herein, on 13.5.1998 (Exhibit P-10) to P.J. Thomas PW21, Circle Inspector of Police that he had wrapped six gold bangles belonging to Padmini Devi, in an old plastic paper, and had hidden them under the earth near the field on the southern side of his house. He offered that if he was taken to his house, he could produce the bangles. Likewise, is the confessional statement of Sibi- accused no.2 (Exhibit P-9) recorded on 13.5.1998 by PJ Thomas PW21, Circle Inspector of Police, that he had wrapped the gold chain of Padmini Devi, in a plastic paper, and had kept the same inside a ""chadjan leaf"" of a coconut tree, standing on the eastern side of his house. He further stated, that he could show the coconut tree and produce the chain. Consequent upon the aforesaid  confessional statements, (Exhibits P-10 and P-9 respectively), the police recovered the gold chain as also the six gold bangles on 13.5.1998 at the instance of the accused. These ornaments came to be identified as the necklace and bangles worn by the deceased Padmini Devi.

10. The evidence produced by the prosecution also falls in different compartments. One set of witnesses were produced to establish the search conducted for the recovery of the body of the deceased Padmini Devi on 8.5.1998. The same set of witnesses deposed about the presence of utensils on the steps of the ghat. The second set of witnesses was produced by the prosecution to establish the presence of Madhu-accused no.1 and Sibi-accused no.2, near the place of occurrence, at or around the time of occurrence on the fateful day i.e., on 8.5.1998. The third set of witnesses deposed about the recovery of the missing gold ornaments, at the instance of the accused. Besides the aforesaid three sets of witnesses, the prosecution examined Dr.Radhakrishnan, Principal, Medical College, Alappuzha as PW20. Dr.Radhakrishnan had conducted the post mortem examination of the body of the deceased. The only other witness whose statement was recorded was PJ Thomas PW21, the then Circle Inspector of Police, whose statement was recorded to show the course and process of investigation.

11. Since the prosecution endeavoured to establish the crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, it shall be necessary for us to record a bird's eye view of the statements of witnesses produced by the prosecution.  First and foremost the prosecution produced Purushothama Kurup as PW1. Purushothama Kurup, deposed that he had recorded the First Information Report. He also asserted, that he had called the husband of the deceased Ayyappa Kurup (PW2) on telephone, to inform him that Padmini Devi was missing. Purushothama Kurup PW1 also deposed, that on being informed that Padmini Devi was missing, he had reached the house of the deceased and participated in her search. PW1 in his cross-examination deposed, that he had seen utensils, some of which were washed, and some were unwashed, at the upper step leading to the field, even though it was acknowledged, that he had not made any statement to the aforesaid effect to the police. Purushothama Kurup PW1 in his deposition also narrated the fact, that a gold chain of ""thara"" fashion weighing about 5-1/2 sovereigns and six gold bangles were missing when the dead body of Padamini Devi was recovered. In his cross-examination he affirmed that he had made the aforesaid assertion, on the basis of the statement made by the deceased's husband Ayyappa Kurup (PW2), after the dead body of the deceased was recovered.

The statement of the husband of the deceased Ayyappa Kurup ( PW2) recorded before the Sessions Court reveals, that both the accused Madhu and Sibi were known to him as they were his neighbours. He affirmed that on 13.5.1998, P.J. Thomas PW21, Circle Inspector of Police, brought the accused to his residence at about 6 p.m. The police party showed him six gold bangles, five of which were hand-cut whereas one was machine made. The police also showed him the recovered gold necklace. Ayyappa Kurup PW2 identified the recovered gold ornaments, as the ones which were worn by the deceased Padmini Devi around  her neck and left arm. PW2 did not depose about the gold earrings worn by the deceased Padmini Devi, which were found on her ears at the time of recovery of her dead body. Ayyappa Kurup asserted during the course of his cross examination, that he had seen the utensils at the ghat, and that, the same had been taken and restored to the house, and were available at his residence. Aushutosh, son of the deceased Padmini Devi was examined as PW3. He asserted, that the accused Madhu and Sibi were known to him. He confirmed that utensils were found lying on the eastern ghat when the search for his mother Padmini Devi was carried out. Like his father, he also identified the recovered ornaments on 13.5.1998, when the police party produced the same along with the accused at their residence.

Ambily, the daughter of the deceased Padmini Devi deposed as PW4. She confirmed having spoken to her brother over the telephone, whereupon, her brother Aushuthosh PW3 who had been sleeping, went out in search of his mother Padmini Devi, and found her missing. PW4 asserted that she had reached her parents house, after she had received a call informing her that her mother was missing. She also asserted that as usual, her mother had gone to wash utensils at the field. She also deposed that her mother's gold chain and six bangles were missing when her dead body was recovered.

Vijayalakshmi was produced by the prosecution as PW5. Vijayalakshmi deposed that the deceased Padmini Devi, as also, both the accused Madhu and Sibi were known to her, as they were residing in her neighbourhood. Vijayalakshmi had joined the search party when Padmini Devi was found missing. In her statement she deposed that she had gone to the ghat on the fateful day, where she had  seen two/three utensils. She asserted that the utensils were lying on the steps of the ghat. She further asserted that some of the utensils were washed while some were still unwashed. She asserted that the deceased was her aunt, and that, the golden necklace and the golden bangles worn by her aunt were missing when her body was recovered. She however acknowledged, that her aunt was still wearing the golden earrings when her body was recovered. It would be relevant to indicate here, that all the aforesaid witnesses (PW1 to PW5) were primarily associated with the search and recovery of the body of deceased Padmini Devi as also, to support the prosecution version that Padmini Devi had gone out of the house to wash utensils at the ghat, on the fateful day. All these witnesses also deposed about the missing gold ornaments, namely, a gold chain and six gold bangles.

12. The next set of witnesses produced by the prosecution was to establish the presence of accused Madhu and Sibi close to the scene of occurrence at or around the time of occurrence on 8.5.1998, as well as, matters associated therewith.

The first witness produced for the aforesaid purpose was Kamalama PW6. Kamalama in her deposition asserted, that the accused Madhu and Sibi had come to her residence at about 8.30 p.m. on 8.5.1998 as it was raining heavily at that time. She asserted that she had served two plantains each to the accused. As per the statement of Kamalama PW6, the accused had come to her house to borrow an umbrella. In her statement she also deposed, that both the accused  were intoxicated and were smelling of liquor. She stated that the accused left her house when the rain subsided.

Madhu, a labourer appeared as PW7. Relevant part of the statement of Madhu PW7 needs to be extracted herein. The same is therefore reproduced hereunder:

""I swam from the eastern bank of the boat jetty to its northern bank. It should have been 9.30 p.m. then. I swam by taking out by shirt and keeping it aloft. A person was seen walking from the Western side and turning to the North. I identified him as A-2 in the light of my torch. I asked whether he is Sibi. Saying that he is Sibi, he walked towards South. While I walked away and reached on the West of the shutter of Kuttachi's chira, a person was seen coming flashing torch-light towards East. On reaching near me, I identified him as A-1. I asked him whether he was swimming. A-1 told me that it is so. He also added that he is a little intoxicated and that he swam and got into the Karumuppathu ghat. A-1 was wearing a kyli mundu (dhothi). The dhoti was wet. There was a country-boat in the Karumuppathu ghat. A-1 told me that if I am to proceed to that jetty, I can cross to the other side. Witness identified both the accused persons. A-1 proceeded towards East and I went to my house.""
Besides the aforesaid, Madhu PW7 also deposed about the recovery of gold ornaments at the instance of accused Madhu and Sibi. He asserted that a golden necklace was recovered from a palm tree at the instance of Sibi-accused no.2, from the compound of his residence, whereas, six gold bangles were recovered from under the earth at the instance of Madhu-accused no.1 from the compound of his residence. In his cross examination he asserted that the death of the deceased Padmini Devi was not natural as the gold ornaments worn by her were missing. It was however clarified by him, that the fact that ornaments worn by the deceased Padmini Devi were missing came to his notice on account of an assertion made to the aforesaid effect by Ayyappa Kurup PW2. His  statement relating to his having seen the accused close to the place of occurrence on 8.5.1998, emerges from his cross-examination which is being extracted hereunder:

""When it was found that ornaments were missing, it was suspected that it should have been a case of murder. I realized that the ornaments were missing when PW.2 told about it. I did not tell them that I had seen the accused persons (on 8.5.1998). I was summoned to appear before the Police Station on 12.5.1998 at 8.00 a.m. A constable came to my house on the 11 th and asked me to come to the Police Station.... I am speaking about this for the first time in Court. Raju is staying just near my house. I swam ashore. At that time, it should have been 9.30 p.m. which fact I did not tell the Police. I had also not told the Police that I had removed my dress and kept it aloft while swimming.
Q. Are you not speaking about this also for the first time in Court?
A. Yes.
The person whom I saw first, proceeded to the West and then turned to the South. I had not stated during the chief-examination that he turned to the North.""
It is also important to extract herein the cross-examination of Madhu PW7 on his incidental presence, which led to his having sighted the accused Madhu and Sibi, close to the place of occurrence:

""To swam ashore some 4/5 minutes are enough. Until I swam ashore and saw the 2nd accused I did not meet anybody else. I was walking by flashing the torch-light. When I got down after the turning, and flashed the torch, I identified the person. The turning is on the East of the Shutter, which is on the East of Kuttachi Chira, and on the West of the Narayanan Achari. A-2 came from the West and turned to the South. I saw him come 15 feet away. I had seen very clearly. I did not notice the colour of the dress of A-2. He was wearing a kyli mundu (dhothi), is what I remember. I did not care to notice whether his dress was wet. I asked him whether he is Sibi. He was walking.
        Q.        Did he try to run away?


        A.        No.  He walked speedily.





I had not told the Police that he had walked speedily. I had not told the Police how I was able to identify Sibi. There are inmates in the house of Narayanan Achari. Sibi did not stand there talking to me. After answering me that he is Sibi, he proceeded towards South. Within two/three minutes I saw A-1. I saw A-1, some 20 feet on the West of the shutter. Both had not come there together. One was proceeding from behind and the other was walking in front. I saw A-1 some 30 feet away from the place where I saw A-2. My dress was not wet. I was walking along by wearing dhoti and shirt. A-1 asked me whether I was swimming. I told I was swimming. It seems that the dhoti worn by A-1 was of blue colour. I had not told the Police about the colour of that dhoti.""
It would be relevant to mention that Madhu PW7 also deposed the presence of utensils on the steps of the ghat. In his statement he affirmed, that he had seen one utensil on the upper step and one utensil on the lower step of the ghat. In response to cross-examination he stated, that he had not made a statement in connection with the utensils on the ghat, because he was not questioned in connection therewith by the police. His presence, at the time of recovery of the gold ornaments at the instance of accused Madhu and Sibi, is also relevant. The same is also accordingly being extracted hereunder:

""I went for work on 13th at 7.30 a.m. In the afternoon, I reached my house at about 2.30 p.m. I had gone back home on coming to learn that the accused will be brought there around 4.00 p.m. I do not remember who told me so. A lot of people had gone to the Jetty. Seeing this, I too proceeded there.
Q. Did the people know that the accused will be brought there and there will be recovery or seizure of ornaments?
A. I do not know about it.
I had not told the Police that as people were seen proceeding to the Jetty, I too proceeded there. I had told the Police that I heard it said by Sibi to the Police that the ornaments are hidden under the cadjan leaf.""
Madhu PW7 also deposed that he remained present when the recovery of the gold necklace was made at the behest of Sibi-accused no.2, and also thereafter, when the recovery of six gold bangles were made at the behest of Madhu- accused no.1.

Rajankutty was produced by the prosecution as PW8. He deposed that he was the Manager of the Toddy Shop from where Madhu-accused no.1 and Sibi- accused no.2, had purchased one bottle of toddy each at 8.00 p.m. on the fateful day, i.e., 8.5.1998.

Sasseendran Nair was produced by the prosecution as PW9. He deposed that he had seen the accused close to the place of occurrence on the fateful day. He also deposed that he had left the house of Chandrasekhara Kurup PW10 at 9 p.m. on 8.5.1998, when the electricity was restored after the power cut. He stated that when he reached near the bridge on the western side of the house of Ayyappa Kurup PW2, he had seen a person ascending the bridge, and then proceeding to the eastern bank. He had also seen another person following him and going towards the east. The first person he had noticed was Sibi-accused no.2, whereas the person who followed Sibi was Madhu-accused no.1. The cross-examination of PW9, in connection with his having sighted the accused is significant, relevant extract thereof is accordingly reproduced hereunder:

""I first met Sibi. I saw Sibi standing under the bridge. Each of the accused persons were seen crossing the bridge from the Western bank to the Eastern bank. I had told the Police that I saw (these persons) crossing the bridge from Western bank to the Eastern bank.",1,
SUDEVANAND,"1. Leave granted.

2. On March 20, 1975, at about 4.15 p.m. when the car in which Mr. Justice A.N. Ray, holding the office of the Chief Justice of India at that time, was travelling, along with his son Shri Ajoy Nath Ray and a Jamadar Jai Nand and the driver Inder Singh, stopped at the intersection of Tilak Marg and Bhagwan Dass road, at a stone throw distance from the Supreme Court of India, two live hand grenades were lobbed inside the car. Fortunately, the grenades did not explode and the occupants of the car, including the Chief Justice of India, escaped unharmed.

3. A case was registered and investigation was started by the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police. But, as the police investigation did not make much headway, on June 30, 1975 the case was handed over to the CBI. On the same day, one Santoshanand Avadhoot (appellant in Criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) 6625 of 2006) was arrested followed by the arrest of an advocate, namely, Ranjan Dwivedi (appellant in criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.6800/2006) on July 6, 1975. 
4. Here, it may be noted that about two and a half months before the attempt on the life of the Chief Justice of India, Shri L.N. Mishra, the Minister of Railways in the Union Cabinet was killed in a bomb blast taking place during a function on the platform of Samastipur Railway Station. In connection with that case, Sudevanand Avadhoot (appellant in criminal appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.6489/2006) and one Vikram alias Jaladhar Das were arrested at Bhagalpur. On July 27, 1975 they were also arrested in the present case relating to the attempt on the life of the Chief Justice and were brought to Delhi where they were sent on police remand from July 31, 1975 to August 14, 1975. While on remand, Vikram made a confessional statement and requested to be allowed to become an Approver. He was produced before a Magistrate on August 14, 1975, before whom he made a statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in short ""Cr.P.C."") giving the details of the conspiracy to kill the Chief Justice of India. He was again produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate on August 22, 1975 before whom he made a similar statement for grant of pardon under Section 306 Cr.P.C.

5. The CBI completed investigation of the case and submitted charge- sheet against the three accused, namely, Sudevanand, Santoshanand and Ranjan Dwivedi and they were put on trial in Sessions Case No.9/1976.  Sudevanand and Santoshanand were charged under Section 307 read with Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4(b) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. So far as Ranjan Dwivedi is concerned, he was charged jointly with the other two accused under Section 120 B of the Penal Code only. At the conclusion of the trial, the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi vide his judgment and order dated October 28, 1976 convicted Sudevanand and Santoshanand under Sections 115, 307/120B of the Penal Code and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 7 years under Section 115 read with 120-B(1), 10 years for attempting to kill Chief Justice A. N. Ray and three other occupants of the car and 7 years under Section 4(b) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908. Ranjan Dwivedi was convicted under Section 115/120 B(1) of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 4 years rigorous imprisonment.

6. It may be noted here that Vikram, the Approver was examined by the prosecution as PW.1 and according to the appellants their conviction is mainly based on his evidence.

7. Against the judgment and order passed by the trial court, Ranjan Dwivedi filed appeal before the High Court on December 6, 1976 which is  registered as Criminal Appeal No.436/1976. Sudevanand and Santoshanand jointly filed a separate appeal which is registered as 443/1976.

8. After the appellants' trial was over, and they were convicted and sentenced by the trial court, as noted above, and after they had filed their appeals before the High Court against the judgment and order passed by the trial court, certain developments took place in the L. N. Mishra murder case. That case was also investigated by the CBI and in that case too Sudevanand and Santoshanand (along with others) were accused and in that case also Vikram was granted pardon on becoming an Approver. According to his statements made before the Magistrates both the killing of L. N. Mishra and the attempt on the life of Chief Justice of India were parts of a larger conspiracy, at the instance of the same organisation and a common group of persons.

9. On August 30, 1978, the Chief Minister of Bihar wrote a highly confidential letter to the Prime Minister of India, a copy of which was endorsed to the DIG (CID) Bihar. In pursuance of the Chief Minister's letter, the DIG (CID) is said to have made an inquiry into the circumstances in which Vikram @ Jaladhar Das had made the confessional statement and was tendered pardon to become Approver. Following the enquiry, on  September 30, 1978 the statement of Vikram was recorded at Danapur jail where he was lodged at that time. The statement was taken in the question and answer form and it was recorded in the presence of Dr. D. Ram, Superintendent; Danapur Hospital, (Ex-officio Jail Superintendent) and Haider Ali, the Jailor. The statement was also recorded on a tape recorder. In this statement Vikram retracted from his earlier statements incriminating himself and the other accused in the case. He said that his earlier statements were obtained by the CBI by subjecting him to great mental and physical torture. He was beaten up and tortured to such an extent that he agreed to make whatever statement CBI wanted him to make. The retraction made by Vikram was placed before the Chief Minister who requested Mr. Tarkunde, a former judge of the Bombay High Court to give a report in light of the statement made by Vikram in jail on September 30, 1978. Mr. Tarkunde is said to have given his opinion that the conviction of all the accused in the Chief Justice's case was based on fabricated evidence of the Approver and, therefore, the High Court should be requested to consider the appeals of the three accused keeping aside the Approver's evidence. We need not go any further in this matter, as all this was plainly outside the legal frame-work.",1,
A.V.M. SALES CORPORATION,"1. On 23rd December, 1988, the parties to the Special Leave Petition entered into an Agreement at Calcutta  for supply of chemicals manufactured by the Respondent to the Petitioner. In continuation of the aforesaid Agreement, the parties arrived at a Mutual Understanding on 15th May, 1989, whereby the Respondent would adjust the advance lying with it and would exclusively supply to the Petitioner its two products, namely, Sodium Chromate and Sodium Dichromate in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam. The Understanding between the parties included other terms and conditions as well. The terms of the Understanding entered into between the parties were reduced into writing in an agreement and the same was executed at Calcutta on 5th August, 1989, reiterating the terms of the Understanding and containing an additional clause indicating that ""Any dispute arising out of this agreement will be subject to Calcutta jurisdiction only."" [Emphasis supplied].

2. Since certain differences arose between the parties relating to the supply of goods in question, the  Petitioner herein filed Original Suit No.588 of 1991 in the Calcutta High Court on 27th August, 1991, for recovery of its alleged dues from the Respondent, after giving due adjustment of the amount of the Invoices raised by the Respondent and filed its claim only for the balance amount, along with penalties etc. Upon receiving summons of the suit filed by the Petitioner, the Respondent on 12th September, 1991, filed a separate suit against the Petitioner at Vijayawada for recovery of a sum of 3,86,453.05, treating the Purchase Order dated 12th February, 1990, to be independent of the Agreement and also sought recovery of supplies made under the Invoices raised by the Respondent upon the Petitioner.

3. The Petitioner duly contested the Suit filed by the Respondent by filing Written Statement, along with relevant documents, in support of its case. Out of the several issues raised by the Petitioner, one was the issue relating to the jurisdiction of the Vijayawada  Court to entertain the Suit on account of the exclusion clause by which all actions arising out of the Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding were to be subject to the Calcutta jurisdiction only. The other issue of importance was with regard to adjustment, inasmuch as, the Purchase Order dated 12th February, 1990, was treated as independent of the Understanding and Agreement arrived at between the parties. Rejecting the objection relating to jurisdiction, the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Vijayawada, by his judgment and decree dated 5th March, 1999, decreed the Respondent's Suit (Original Suit No.519 of 1991) with costs for a sum of 3,86,453.05, together with interest at the rate of 12% per annum, from the date of the Suit till realisation of the principal amount of 2,98,267.50. The Petitioner filed First Appeal No.1352 of 1999 before the Andhra Pradesh High Court against the aforesaid judgment and decree dated 5th March, 1999. By judgment and order dated 18th January, 2007, the learned Single Judge of the High  Court dismissed the Appeal filed by the Petitioner. It is against the aforesaid judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the First Appeal preferred by the Petitioner that the present Special Leave Petition has been filed.

4. Apart from the other grounds taken with regard to factual aspect of the matter, grounds have also been taken regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts at Calcutta agreed to by the parties in the Agreement and whether the same was not binding upon the parties. A further ground has also been taken as to whether in breach of the Agreement, the Respondent was entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of a Court at Vijayawada, whose jurisdiction stood ousted by the Agreement entered into between the parties.

5. On the strength of the pleadings of the parties, five issues were framed by the Trial Court, of which the first issue was whether the Court at Vijayawada had  territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit. By his judgment and decree dated 5th March, 1999, in O.S.

No.519 of 1991, the learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Vijayawada, held that the Court at Vijayawada had jurisdiction to entertain the Suit as part of the cause of action for the suit arose within its jurisdiction. The learned Trial Judge, accordingly, decreed the Suit, as indicated hereinabove. In the First Appeal, being F.A. No.1352 of 1992, the learned Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court observed that the main contention of the Appellant before the High Court, who is the Petitioner herein, was that the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Vijayawada, had no jurisdiction to entertain the Suit as no part of the cause of action had arisen at Vijayawada. According to the Petitioner, its place of business was at Calcutta and the Agreement for the supply of the goods in question was also entered into at Calcutta. The goods were to be delivered at Calcutta and payment in respect thereof was to be made at Calcutta and, accordingly,  the Court at Vijayawada had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the Suit under Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure as no part of the cause of action had arisen within its jurisdiction. It was also emphasised that in the Agreement which was made Exh.D-5, it has been stipulated in Column 13 that any dispute arising out of the Agreement would be subject to the Calcutta jurisdiction only.

6. The question involved in this Special Leave Petition has several dimensions, including the question as to whether the parties to an agreement can contract in violation of Sections 23 and 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Obviously, the parties cannot contract against the statutory provisions. A connected question would arise as to whether the parties to an agreement can confer jurisdiction on a Court which has no territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain a matter? The answer to the second question is also in the negative. However, in this case a slightly  different question arises, namely, as to whether if two Courts have jurisdiction to try a suit, can the parties to an agreement mutually agree to exclude the jurisdiction of one Court in preference to the other and as to whether the same would amount to violation of the provisions of Sections 23 and 28 of the Indian Contract Act? The said question has been answered in the affirmative by the Trial Court and has been upheld by the High Court.

7. The question which has been raised in this Special Leave Petition is not new and has been considered by this Court earlier in several decisions. We are, therefore, required to consider as to whether the cause of action for the Suit filed by the Respondent in Vijayawada arose within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Principal Senior Civil Judge at Vijayawada, exclusively, or whether such cause of action arose both in Vijayawada and also in Calcutta? As has been mentioned hereinbefore on behalf of the Petitioner, it  had been urged that the entire cause of action for the Suit had arisen within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Courts and the Courts at Vijayawada had no jurisdiction whatsoever to entertain a suit pertaining to the Understanding and Agreement arrived at between the parties. However, it was contended on behalf of the Respondent that its Registered Office was situate at Vijayawada, the Invoices for the goods were raised at Vijayawada, the goods were dispatched from Vijayawada and the money was payable to the Plaintiff or its nominee at Vijayawada, by way of Demand Drafts and, accordingly, the Courts at Vijayawada had jurisdiction to entertain the Suit.

8. It has often been stated by this Court that cause of action comprises a bundle of facts which are relevant for the determination of the lis between the parties. In the instant case, since the invoices for the goods in question were raised at Vijayawada, the goods were dispatched from Vijayawada and the money was  payable to the Respondent or its nominee at Vijayawada, in our view, the same comprised part of the bundle of facts giving rise to the cause of action for the Suit.

At the same time, since the Petitioner/ Defendant in the Suit had its place of business at Calcutta and the Agreement for supply of the goods was entered into at Calcutta and the goods were to be delivered at Calcutta, a part of the cause of action also arose within the jurisdiction of the Courts at Calcutta for the purposes of the suit. Accordingly, both the Courts within the jurisdiction of Calcutta and Vijayawada had jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure to try the Suit, as part of the cause of action of the Suit had arisen within the jurisdiction of both the said Courts.

9. This leads us to the next question as to whether, if two Courts have jurisdiction to entertain a Suit, whether the parties may by mutual agreement exclude the jurisdiction of one of the Courts, having regard to the  provisions of Sections 23 and 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Section 23 of the aforesaid Act indicates what considerations and objects are lawful and what are not, including the considerations or objects of an agreement, if forbidden by law. Section 28 of the Act, which has a direct bearing on the facts of this case, clearly spells out that any agreement in restraint of legal proceedings is void. For the sake of reference, the same is extracted hereinbelow :

""28. Agreements in restrain of legal proceedings, void - [Every agreement,

(a) by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights, or

(b) which extinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any party thereto from any liability, under or in respect of any contract on the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any party from enforcing his rights, is void to the extent.] Exception 1 : Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that may arise.- This  section shall not render illegal contract, by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred.

Exception 2 : Saving of contract to refer question that have already arisen. - Nor shall this section render illegal any contract in writing, by which two or more persons agree to refer to arbitration any question between them which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time being as to reference to arbitration.""

10. Basically, what Section 28 read with Section 23 does, is to make it very clear that if any mutual agreement is intended to restrict or extinguish the right of a party from enforcing his/her right under or in respect of a contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary Tribunals, such an agreement would to that extent be void. In other words, parties cannot contract against a statute.

11. One of the earlier cases in which this question had arisen, was the case of A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. A.P. Agencies, Salem [AIR 1989 SC 1239 = (1989) 2 SCC 163]. In the said case, the cause of action for the suit had arisen both within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court at Salem in Andhra Pradesh and in the Civil Court of Kaira in the State of Gujarat. The question arose as to whether since by mutual agreement the jurisdiction had been confined only to the Courts within Kaira jurisdiction, the suit filed at Salem was at all maintainable? This Court, inter alia, held that there could be no doubt that an agreement to oust absolutely the jurisdiction of the Court will be unlawful and void, being against public policy. However, such a result would ensue if it is shown that the jurisdiction to which the parties had agreed to submit had nothing to do with the contract.

If, on the other hand, it is found that the jurisdiction agreed would also be a proper jurisdiction in the matter of the contract, it could not be said  that it ousted the jurisdiction of the Court. After considering the facts involved in the said case and the submissions made on behalf of the parties, this Court observed as follows :

""Thus it is now a settled principle that where there may be two or more competent Courts which can entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause of action having arisen therewithin, if the parties to the contract agreed to vest jurisdiction in one such Court to try the dispute which might arise as between themselves, the agreement would be valid. If such a contract is clear, unambiguous and explicit and not vague, it is not hit by Sections 23 and 28 of the Contract Act and cannot also be understood as parties contracting against the statute.""
12. A similar view was taken by this Court in Angile Insulations vs. Davy Ashmore India Ltd. & Anr. [(1995) 4 SCC 153], wherein the Hon'ble Judges while referring to the decision of this Court in A.B.C. Laminart Pvt.

Ltd.'s case (supra), inter alia, held that where two Courts have jurisdiction consequent upon the cause of action or a part thereof arising therein, if the parties agree in clear and unambiguous terms to exclude  the jurisdiction of the other, the said decision could not offend the provisions of Section 23 of the Contract Act. In such a case, the suit would lie in the Court to be agreed upon by the parties.

13. This Court has consistently taken the same view in several subsequent cases. We may refer to one such decision of this Court in Hanil Era Textiles Ltd. Vs. Puromatic Filters (P) Ltd. [AIR 2004 SC 2432 = (2004) 4 SCC 671], where part of the cause of action arose at both Delhi and Bombay. This Court held that the mutual agreement to exclude the jurisdiction of the Delhi Courts to entertain the suit was not opposed to public policy and was valid.

14. As indicated herein earlier, in this case also the cause of action for the Original Suit No.519 of 1991, filed by the Respondent before the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Vijayawada, arose partly within the  jurisdiction of the Calcutta Courts and the Courts at Vijayawada.

15. Having regard to the provisions referred to hereinabove, though the Courts at Vijayawada would also have jurisdiction, along with the Courts at Calcutta, to entertain and try a suit relating to and arising out of the Agreement dated 23rd December, 1988, and the Mutual Understanding dated 15th May, 1989, such jurisdiction of the Courts at Vijayawada would stand ousted by virtue of the exclusion clause in the Agreement.

16. The Special Leave Petition has, therefore, to be allowed. The decree passed by the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Vijayawada in O.S. No.519 of 1991, and the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 18th January, 2007, are set aside. The Trial Court at Vijayawada is directed to return the plaint of the Original Suit No.519 of 1991 to the Plaintiff to present the same  before the appropriate Court in Calcutta having jurisdiction to try the suit.

17. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, allowed, but there will be no order as to costs.",1,

2. Under the Detention Order No.Cril/NSA/No.10 of 2011, Imphal, the 31st January, 2011, issued by the  District Magistrate, Imphal West District, Manipur, the Appellant's husband, Yumman Somendro @ Somo @ Tiken, was detained under the provisions of the National Security Act, 1980. The said detention order was approved by the Governor of Manipur on 7th February, 2011, in exercise of his powers conferred under Section 3(4) of the aforesaid Act. The order of the Governor of Manipur dated 18th March, 2011, confirming the detention order passed against the husband of the Appellant and fixing the period of detention for 12 months on the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority that the detenu was likely to be released on bail by the normal criminal Courts in the near future, was challenged on behalf of Yumman Somendro in the Gauhati High Court (Imphal Bench), but without success. This Appeal is directed against the said order of the High Court and the order of detention itself. Earlier, the Appellant's husband had been  arrested on 21st March, 1994 in connection with FIR No.478(3)1994 IPS u/s 13 Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, but was released on bail by the normal criminal Court. Despite the above, again on 29th June, 1995, the Appellant's husband was arrested in connection with FIR No.450(6)95 under Churachandpur P.S. under Sections 386 and 34 IPC.

Though he was released on bail by the normal criminal Court, he was again arrested under Section 13 UA (P) Act in connection with FIR No.190(5)98 and was released on bail on 8th July, 1998. After being released on bail by the normal Criminal Court, Yumman Somendro was again arrested on 16th January, 2011, in connection with FIR No.21(1)11 IPS under Section 302 IPC for the alleged murder of the then Chairman of the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur, Dr. N. Kunjabihari Singh. The Appellant's husband was produced before the Magistrate on 17th January, 2011, who remanded him  to police custody till 31st January, 2011. On the said date, he was further remanded to police custody till 2nd February, 2011, and when he was produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in connection with the said case, he was served with a copy of the detention order dated 31st January, 2011, issued by the District Magistrate, Imphal West, under the National Security Act, 1980.

3. On 31st January, 2011, the Appellant's husband was served with the grounds of detention under the National Security Act, 1980, under the authority of the District Magistrate, Imphal West. Along with the said order, copies of the documents on which the detaining authority had relied on to arrive at the conclusion that the detention of the Appellant's husband was necessary, was also served on him.

4. On a perusal of the grounds of detention, it is clear that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority is founded on the belief that after having availed of bail facility, the Appellant's husband could indulge in commission of further prejudicial activities. An alternative preventive measure was, therefore, immediately needed in the circumstances.

5. On behalf of the Appellant, Mr. Sanjay Parikh, relied heavily on the decision of this Court in Rekha Vs. State of Tamil Nadu through Sec. to Govt.

[(2011) 4 SCC 260], in which it had been held that in the absence of material particulars in similar cases in which bail had been granted, the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority was merely a ruse for issuance of the impugned detention order. After considering various decisions of this Court and the views of several jurists and the submissions made on behalf of the  parties, the Division Bench of the High Court was of the view that the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority was based on proper material and the detaining authority was also aware that the detenu was in custody and was likely to be released on bail. The detaining authority, therefore, was of the view that the detention of the detenu was required in order to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order as he was likely to be released on bail in the near future by the normal criminal Courts. On the aforesaid reasoning, the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the detenu's wife.

6. The main contention urged by Mr. Parikh appearing for the Appellant was that the personal life and liberty of a person was too precious to be allowed to be interfered with in the manner in which it had been done. Mr. Parikh submitted that  as would be evident, the detention order was passed on a mere supposition that the Appellant's husband was likely to be released on bail in the near future in connection with the case in respect of which he had been arrested and that in view of such future apprehension, the detention order was sought to be legitimised. Mr. Parikh submitted that not only had the Appellant's husband not applied for bail at any stage, nor was there any indication that he intends to do so, which could give rise to the supposition that in the future there was every likelihood that he would be released on bail. Mr. Parikh submitted that supposition could never take the place of facts which were necessary to establish a case which warranted the detention of a person without any trial.

7. Mr. Parikh pointed out that Yumman Somendro had been arrested in connection with several cases, but had been released on bail in all the said cases  till ultimately an order of detention was passed against him under the National Security Act, 1980, on the flimsiest of excuses. Mr. Parikh submitted that if at all the Appellant's husband was alleged to have committed a crime which was punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the same could not be equated with the national security in any way, which warranted the issuance of a detention order under the National Security Act, 1980.

8. Referring to the provisions of Section 3 of the aforesaid Act, Mr. Parikh submitted that the sine qua non for an order of detention to be passed under the National Security Act, 1980, is that the Central Government or the State Government would have to be satisfied that in order to prevent any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order or from acting in any manner prejudicial to the  maintenance of supply of services essential to the community that it was necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained. Mr. Parikh submitted that although the Appellant's husband had been charged with having committed an offence under Section 302 IPC, Section 386 and Section 13 Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, there was no material whatsoever to bring the Appellant's husband within the ambit of the grounds enumerated in Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 of the aforesaid Act. Mr. Parikh submitted that the order of detention had been passed not for the reasons enumerated in Sub-Section (2) of Section 3, but since the police was unable to pin any offence against the Appellant's husband on account whereof he could be denied bail by the Courts.

9. In support of his submissions, Mr. Parikh firstly referred to the decision of this Court in Union of India Vs. Paul Manickam & Anr. [(2003) 8  SCC 342], wherein while considering the delay in disposal of a representation in the matter of preventive detention, this Court noticed that when the detenu was already in custody, the anticipated and apprehended acts were practical impossibilities, as was the case as far as the Appellant's husband is concerned. This Court further observed that as far as the question relating to the procedure to be adopted in case the detenu is already in custody is concerned, the detaining authorities would have to apply their minds and show their awareness in this regard in the grounds of detention. The necessity of keeping such person in detention under preventive detention laws have to be clearly indicated. It was further observed that the subsisting custody of the detenu by itself does not invalidate an order of his preventive detention and the decision in this regard has to depend on the facts of each case.

However, preventive detention being necessary to prevent the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or to the maintenance of public order or economic stability, ordinarily it is not needed when the detenu is already in custody and the detaining authority must be reasonably satisfied with cogent materials that there is likelihood of his release and in view of his antecedent activities which are proximate in point of time, he must be detained in order to prevent him from indulging in such prejudicial activities.

10. Mr. Parikh also referred to another decision of this Court in Haradhan Saha Vs. The State of West Bengal & Ors. [(1975) 3 SCC 198], wherein in the case of a preventive detention order passed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971, the distinction between preventive detention and criminal prosecution was sought to be defined and  it was held that the essential concept of preventive detention is that the detention of a person is not to punish him for something he has done, but to prevent him from doing it. It was further observed that the basis of detention is the satisfaction of the Executive of a reasonable probability or the likelihood of the detenu acting in a manner similar to his past acts and preventing him by detention from doing the same. The criminal conviction, on the other hand, is for an act already done which can only be possible by a trial and legal evidence.

11. Referring to the Division Bench order dated 31st January, 2011, Mr. Parikh submitted that the same did not contain any material whatsoever on which the detaining authority could have arrived at a satisfaction that Yumman Somendro had acted in any manner which warranted his detention under the provisions of Section 3(2) of the National Security  Act, 1980. The only reason given for issuing such order of detention was that Yumman Somendro, who was in police custody, was likely to be released on bail in the near future by the normal criminal Courts, as, according to him, bails are granted in similar cases by the criminal Courts. Mr. Parikh submitted that this is a case where the detention order passed against the Appellant's husband was without any basis whatsoever and had been resorted to on account of the failure of the police to keep him in judicial custody.

12. On the other hand, appearing for the State of Manipur, Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Advocate, repeated the facts indicated earlier to the effect that the Appellant's husband had been arrested in connection with several cases and, in particular, for the murder of Dr. N. Kunjabihari Singh, the then Chairman of the Board of Secondary Education, Manipur, in his office room on 11th January, 2011.

Mr. Gupta submitted that it was subsequent to the  murder of Dr. N. Kunjabihari Singh that on 31st January, 2011, the order of detention was passed under Section 3 of the aforesaid Act and was served on the Appellant's husband, while he was in judicial custody, on 2nd February, 2011. It was also submitted that thereafter the grounds of detention were provided to the Appellant's husband, as required under Section 8 of the above-mentioned Act to enable him at the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order to the appropriate Government. The detention order was considered by the State Government which approved the same on 7th February, 2011, and the representation made by Yumman Somendro to the State Government was rejected on 10th February, 2011. The matter was, thereafter, referred to the Advisory Board which came to the conclusion that since Yumman Somendro was a member of the banned organization, Kanglei Yaol Kanna Lup, he was a  potential danger to society, whose activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and there was a likelihood that he would continue such activities the moment he was released from detention and accordingly he should be detained for the maximum period of 12 months, as provided under Section 13 of the Act. Mr. Gupta submitted that since the detention order was to end on 31st January, 2012, there could be no reason to interfere with the same prior to its dissolution by efflux of time.

13. Having carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of respective parties, we are inclined to hold that the extra-ordinary powers of detaining an individual in contravention of the provisions of Article 22(2) of the Constitution was not warranted in the instant case, where the grounds of detention do not disclose any material which was before the detaining authority, other  than the fact that there was every likelihood of Yumman Somendro being released on bail in connection with the cases in respect of which he had been arrested, to support the order of detention. Article 21 of the Constitution enjoins that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except, according to procedure established by law. In the instant case, although the power is vested with the concerned authorities, unless the same are invoked and implemented in a justifiable manner, such action of the detaining authority cannot be sustained, inasmuch as, such a detention order is an exception to the provisions of Articles 21 and 22(2) of the Constitution.

14. When the Courts thought it fit to release the Appellant's husband on bail in connection with the cases in respect of which he had been arrested, the mere apprehension that he was likely to be released on bail as a ground of his detention, is not  justified. In addition to the above, the FIRs in respect of which the Appellant's husband had been arrested relate to the years 1994, 1995 and 1998 respectively, whereas the order of detention was passed against him on 31st January, 2011, almost 12 years after the last FIR No.190(5)98 IPS under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. There is no live link between the earlier incidents and the incident in respect of which the detention order had been passed.

15. As has been observed in various cases of similar nature by this Court, the personal liberty of an individual is the most precious and prized right guaranteed under the Constitution in Part III thereof. The State has been granted the power to curb such rights under criminal laws as also under the laws of preventive detention, which, therefore, are required to be exercised with due caution as well as upon a proper appreciation of the facts as  to whether such acts are in any way prejudicial to the interest and the security of the State and its citizens, or seek to disturb public law and order, warranting the issuance of such an order. An individual incident of an offence under the Indian Penal Code, however heinous, is insufficient to make out a case for issuance of an order of preventive detention.

16. In our view, the detaining authority acted rather casually in the matter in issuing the order of detention and the High Court also appears to have missed the right to liberty as contained in Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 22(2) thereof, as well as the provisions of Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

17. The Appeal must, therefore, succeed. The impugned order of detention dated 31st January, 2011, passed by the District Magistrate, Imphal  West District, Manipur, in regard to the detention of Yumman Somendro @ Somo @ Tiken son of Y. Roton Singh, is hereby quashed. The Appeal accordingly succeeds. Let the Appellant's husband, Yumman Somendro, be released from custody, if he is not required in connection with any other case.",1,
MOHAN SONI,"1. Leave granted.

2. The appellant, victim of a motor vehicle accident has come to this Court making grievance about the low amount of compensation awarded to him by the Tribunal and the High Court.

3. The appellant used to earn his livelihood as a cart puller. On December 17, 2003, at about 3.00 P.M. he was carrying some goods on a four-wheel cart when he was hit by a tanker which was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. In the accident, the left leg of the appellant was crushed. The X-Ray report showed multiple  fractures in the left leg. He was admitted to a hospital where he had to undergo two surgeries between December 17, 2003 and January 3, 2004 and in the end his left leg was amputated below the knee. He filed an application (Claim Case No.16/2004) before the Second Additional Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Gwalior, (M.P.), claiming compensation for the injuries suffered by him under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. It was stated by him before the Tribunal that at the time of accident his age was 50 years and his monthly income, as a cart puller, was Rs.3,300/-. As a result of the amputation of his leg, he was no longer in a position to walk without support and he was, therefore, rendered incapable of doing any work and to earn his livelihood.

4. The Tribunal found and held that the accident took place as a result of the negligent and rash driving by the tanker driver. It further held that at the time of the accident the age of the appellant was 55 years and his monthly income was Rs.2,400/- and not Rs.3,300/- as claimed by him. Coming to the extent of disability, the Tribunal referred to the disabled-person identity card given to the appellant (Exhibit P.27) in which his disability was shown as 60%. The Tribunal  also observed that when the claimant appeared in court, it was evident that his left leg was amputated below the knee. Though the appellant's disabled-person card showed his disability as 60%, the Tribunal, with reference to Schedule 1 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, held that the appellant's disability could not be reckoned above 50%.

5. Having held that that the appellant's age at the time of the accident was 55 years, the Tribunal applied the multiplier of 11 and on the basis of the findings that the appellant's monthly income was Rs.2,400/- and the extent of his disability was 50%, fixed the amount of Rs.1,58,400/- as compensation for loss of future earnings. In addition to this, the Tribunal gave to the appellant Rs.30,000/- for mental and physical agony due to permanent disability and a further sum of Rs.15,000/- for medical expenses and special diet. Accordingly, the Tribunal, by its award dated July 31, 2004 held the appellant entitled to receive a total sum of Rs.2,03,400/- as compensation along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition on January 9, 2004 till the date of payment.

6. Against the award of the Tribunal, the appellant preferred an appeal (Miscellaneous Appeal No.844 of 2004) before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Gwalior Bench. In the High Court, the case was referred to Lok Adalat where the Insurance Company agreed for enhancement of the amount of compensation by Rs.50,000/-. It, however, appears that the matter could not be settled in the Lok Adalat and the appeal came to be finally heard and disposed of by the High Court on merits. The High Court by its judgment and order dated April 1, 2009 simply raised the amount of the monthly income of the appellant from Rs.2,400/- to Rs.3,000/- and, thereby, arrived at a sum of Rs.1,98,000/- as compensation for the loss of future earnings. The total compensation amount was, thus, raised from Rs.2,03,400/- to Rs.2,58,000/- (practically what was offered by the Insurance Company before the Lok Adalat on which no settlement was arrived at between the parties!)

7. On hearing counsel for the parties and on going through the materials on record, we are of the view that both the Tribunal and the High Court were in error in pegging down the disability of the appellant to 50% with reference to Schedule 1 of the Workmen's  Compensation Act, 1923. In the context of loss of future earning, any physical disability resulting from an accident has to be judged with reference to the nature of work being performed by the person suffering the disability. This is the basic premise and once that is grasped, it clearly follows that the same injury or loss may affect two different persons in different ways. Take the case of a marginal farmer who does his cultivation work himself and ploughs his land with his own two hands; or the puller of a cycle-rickshaw, one of the main means of transport in hundreds of small towns all over the country. The loss of one of the legs either to the marginal farmer or the cycle-rickshaw-puller would be the end of the road insofar as their earning capacity is concerned. But in case of a person engaged in some kind of desk work in an office, the loss of a leg may not have the same effect. The loss of a leg (or for that matter the loss of any limb) to anyone is bound to have very traumatic effects on one's personal, family or social life but the loss of one of the legs to a person working in the office would not interfere with his work/earning capacity in the same degree as in the case of a marginal farmer or a cycle-rickshaw-puller.

8. The question of loss of earning capacity resulting from amputation of one the legs in the case of a tanker driver was considered by this Court in K. Janardhan v. United India Insurance Company Limited and another, (2008) 8 SCC 518. In that case, a tanker driver suffered serious injuries in a motor accident and as a result, his right leg was amputated upto the knee joint. He made a claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923. The Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation held that disability suffered by him as a result of the loss of the leg was 100% and awarded compensation to him on that basis. In appeal, the High Court, like in the present case, referred to the Schedule to the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 and held that the loss of a leg on amputation amounted to reduction in the earning capacity by 60% and, accordingly, reduced the compensation awarded to the tanker driver. This Court set aside the High Court judgment and held that the tanker driver had suffered 100% disability and incapacity in earning his keep as a tanker driver as his right leg was amputated from the knee and, accordingly, restored the order passed by the Commissioner of Workmen's Compensation. In K. Janardhan this  Court also referred to and relied upon an earlier decision of the Court in Pratap Narain Singh Deo v. Srinivas Sabata (1976) 1 SCC 289, in which a carpenter who suffered an amputation of his left arm from the elbow was held to have suffered complete loss of his earning capacity.

9. In a more recent decision in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and another, (2011) 1 SCC 343, this Court considered in great detail the correlation between the physical disability suffered in an accident and the loss of earning capacity resulting from it. In paragraphs 10, 11 and 13 of the judgment in Raj Kumar, this Court made the following observations:

""10. Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of injuries, the assessment of compensation under the head of loss of future earnings would depend upon the effect and impact of such permanent disability on his earning capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically apply the percentage of permanent disability as the percentage of economic loss or loss of earning capacity. In most of the cases, the percentage of economic loss, that is, the percentage of loss of earning capacity, arising from a permanent disability will be different from the percentage of permanent disability. Some Tribunals wrongly assume that in all cases, a particular extent (percentage) of permanent disability would result in a corresponding loss of earning capacity, and consequently, if the evidence  produced show 45% as the permanent disability, will hold that there is 45% loss of future earning capacity. In most of the cases, equating the extent (percentage) of loss of earning capacity to the extent (percentage) of permanent disability will result in award of either too low or too high a compensation.
11. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of the permanent disability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning capacity in terms of a percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying the standard multiplier method used to determine loss of dependency). We may however note that in some cases, on appreciation of evidence and assessment, the Tribunal may find that the percentage of loss of earning capacity as a result of the permanent disability is approximately the same as the percentage of permanent disability in which case, of course, the Tribunal will adopt the said percentage for determination of compensation. (See for example, the decisions of this Court in Arvind Kumar Mishra v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2010) 10 SCC 254 and Yadava Kumar v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. (2010) 10 SCC

341).

13. Ascertainment of the effect of the permanent disability on the actual earning capacity involves three steps. The Tribunal has to first ascertain what activities the claimant could carry on in spite of the permanent disability and what he could not do as a result of the permanent disability (this is also relevant for awarding compensation under the head of loss of amenities of life). The second step is to ascertain his avocation, profession and nature of work before the accident, as also his age. The third step is to find out whether (i) the claimant is totally disabled from earning any kind of livelihood, or (ii) whether in spite of the permanent disability, the claimant  could still effectively carry on the activities and functions, which he was earlier carrying on, or (iii) whether he was prevented or restricted from discharging his previous activities and functions, but could carry on some other or lesser scale of activities and functions so that he continues to earn or can continue to earn his livelihood.""

10. In light of the aforesaid decisions, we find it extremely difficult to uphold the decision of the High Court and the Tribunal based on the finding that the loss of the appellant's earning capacity as a result of the amputation of his left leg was only 50%. It is noted above that the appellant used to earn his livelihood as a cart puller. The Tribunal has found that at the time of the accident his age was 55 years. At that age it would be impossible for the appellant to find any job. From the trend of cross-examination it appears that an attempt was made to suggest that notwithstanding the loss of one leg the appellant could still do some work sitting down such as selling vegetables. It is all very well to theoretically talk about a cart puller changing his work and becoming a vegetable vendor. But the computation of compensation payable to a victim of motor accident who suffered some serious permanent disability resulting from the loss of a limb etc. should not take into account such indeterminate factors. Any scaling down of the compensation should require something more  tangible than a hypothetical conjecture that notwithstanding the disability, the victim could make up for the loss of income by changing his vocation or by adopting another means of livelihood. The party advocating for a lower amount of compensation for that reason must plead and show before the Tribunal that the victim enjoyed some legal protection (as in the case of persons covered by The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995) or in case of the vast multitude who earn their livelihood in the unorganized sector by leading cogent evidence that the victim had in fact changed his vocation or the means of his livelihood and by virtue of such change he was deriving a certain income. The loss of earning capacity of the appellant, according to us, may be as high as 100% but in no case it would be less than 90%. We, accordingly, find and hold that the compensation for the loss of appellant's future earnings must be computed on that basis. On calculation on that basis, the amount of compensation would come to Rs.3,56,400/- and after addition of a sum of Rs.30,000/- and Rs.15,000/- the total amount would be Rs.4,01,400/-. The additional compensation amount would carry interest at the rate of 9% per  annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of payment. The additional amount of compensation along with interest should be paid to the appellant without delay and not later than three months from today.

11. In the result, the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.",1,
State of Punjab,"judgment and order dated 04.11.2009 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Revision Petition Nos. 653 and 655 of 2000 for nature of offence and quantum of sentence whereby the High Court partly allowed the revision petition and reduced the quantum of sentence awarded by the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Amritsar as upheld by the Additional Sessions Judge,  Amritsar under Sections 304A, 337 and 279 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `IPC').

3)     Brief facts:


(a)    On   30.10.1992,   one   Dhian   Singh-the   Complainant 



(PW-3), after attending the last rites of one of his relatives at Village Mustabad, Amritsar was returning to Batala along with his family members in a Jhang Transport Bus bearing No. PB-

02-D-9485. The bus was being driven at a very high speed by the driver-Respondent No. 1 herein. When the aforesaid bus reached the bus stand at Mudhal, at that time, a truck bearing No. PB-02-C-9665 which was being driven by Respondent No. 2 herein was coming from the opposite side at a very high speed. Both the drivers were driving their vehicle at a very high speed and in rash and negligent manner, as a result of which, both the vehicles collided with each other and two passengers, namely, Darshan Singh s/o Bela Singh and Banso w/o Ajit Singh died at the spot. The other passengers, namely, Sonia, Dalbir Singh and Ramandeep were taken to the Civil Hospital but later on they succumbed to their injuries.

(b) On the basis of the complaint of Dhian Singh, FIR No. 125/92 was registered under Sections 304A, 279 and 337 of IPC and after formal investigation the case was forwarded to the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Amritsar. The Judicial Magistrate, by order dated 14.12.1998, convicted both the accused persons and directed them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 2 years each for the offence under Section 304A and to pay fine of Rs. 200/- each, in default, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months and to also undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months each for the offence punishable under Sections 337 and 279 IPC.

(c) Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 14.12.1998, the accused persons preferred an appeal before the Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar. Vide judgment dated 20.05.2000, the Additional Sessions Judge upheld the judgment and order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Amritsar.

(d) Questioning the same, the respondents herein filed Criminal Revision Petition being Nos. 653 and 655 of 2000 qua nature of offence and quantum of sentence before the  High Court. The High Court, by order dated 04.11.2009, while confining to the question of quantum of sentence only, reduced the sentence of the accused persons to the period already undergone (15 days) and in addition thereto, enhanced the fine to an amount of Rs. 25,000/- each.

(e) Against the order of the High Court, the State of Punjab has filed these appeals before this Court by way of special leave petitions.

4) Heard Mr. Ashok Aggarwal, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Sudhir Walia and Mr. K.G. Bhagat, learned counsel for the respondents.

5) Before the High Court, the respondents, who preferred the revisions, did not dispute the finding relating to negligence rendered by the courts below and confined their submissions to the quantum of sentence only and prayed that the sentence be reduced to the period already undergone. In support of the above claim, they pointed out that they had suffered a protracted trial for about 17 years and had already undergone custody for 15 days, therefore, prayed for lenient view by modifying the sentence. On the other hand, on behalf of the  State, it was submitted that inasmuch as the negligence was proved beyond reasonable doubt, therefore, no leniency should be shown to the accused. The High Court, without taking note of the seriousness of the matter, namely, due to the negligence of the two drivers, five persons traveling in the bus died, merely because of protracted trial of about 17 years and both of them had served sentence for a period of 15 days, reduced the same to the period already undergone and enhanced the fine to an amount of Rs.25,000/- each.

6) It is not in dispute that the trial Court on appreciation of evidence and accepting the prosecution witnesses convicted the respondents for an offence under Section 304A. The said section reads as under:

304A. Causing death by negligence.- Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.""
7) Section 304A was inserted in the Penal Code by the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Act 27 of 1870 to cover those cases wherein a person cause the death of another by such acts as are rash or negligent but there is no intention to cause  death and no knowledge that the act will cause death. The case should not be covered by Sections 299 and 300 only then it will come under this section. The section provides punishment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or fine or both in case of homicide by rash or negligent act. To bring a case of homicide under Section 304A IPC, the following conditions must exist, namely,

1) There must be death of the person in question;

2) the accused must have caused such death; and

3) that such act of the accused was rash or negligent and that it did not amount to culpable homicide.

8) Even a decade ago, considering the galloping trend in road accidents in India and its devastating consequences, this Court in Dalbir Singh vs. State of Haryana, (2000) 5 SCC 82 held that, while considering the quantum of sentence to be imposed for the offence of causing death by rash or negligent driving of automobiles, one of the prime considerations should be deterrence. A professional driver should not take a chance thinking that even if he is convicted, he would be dealt with  leniently by the court. The following principles laid down in that decision are very relevant:

""1. When automobiles have become death traps any leniency shown to drivers who are found guilty of rash driving would be at the risk of further escalation of road accidents. All those who are manning the steering of automobiles, particularly professional drivers, must be kept under constant reminders of their duty to adopt utmost care and also of the consequences befalling them in cases of dereliction. One of the most effective ways of keeping such drivers under mental vigil is to maintain a deterrent element in the sentencing sphere. Any latitude shown to them in that sphere would tempt them to make driving frivolous and a frolic.
13. Bearing in mind the galloping trend in road accidents in India and the devastating consequences visiting the victims and their families, criminal courts cannot treat the nature of the offence under Section 304-A IPC as attracting the benevolent provisions of Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act. While considering the quantum of sentence to be imposed for the offence of causing death by rash or negligent driving of automobiles, one of the prime considerations should be deterrence. A professional driver pedals the accelerator of the automobile almost throughout his working hours. He must constantly inform himself that he cannot afford to have a single moment of laxity or inattentiveness when his leg is on the pedal of a vehicle in locomotion. He cannot and should not take a chance thinking that a rash driving need not necessarily cause any accident; or even if any accident occurs it need not necessarily result in the death of any human being; or even if such death ensues he might not be convicted of the offence; and lastly, that even if he is convicted he would be dealt with leniently by the court. He must always keep in his mind the fear psyche that if he is convicted of the offence for causing death of a human being due to his callous driving of the vehicle he cannot escape from a jail sentence. This is the role which the courts can play, particularly at the level of trial courts, for lessening the high rate of motor accidents due to callous driving of automobiles.""
9) The same principles have been reiterated in B.

Nagabhushanam vs. State of Karnataka, 2008 (5) SCC

730.

10) It is settled law that sentencing must have a policy of correction. If anyone has to become a good driver, must have a better training in traffic laws and moral responsibility with special reference to the potential injury to human life and limb. Considering the increased number of road accidents, this Court, on several occasions, has reminded the criminal courts dealing with the offences relating to motor accidents that they cannot treat the nature of the offence under Section 304A IPC as attracting the benevolent provisions of Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. We fully endorse the view expressed by this Court in Dalbir Singh (supra).

11) While considering the quantum of sentence to be imposed for the offence of causing death or injury by rash and negligent driving of automobiles, one of the prime considerations should be deterrence. The persons driving motor vehicles cannot and should not take a chance thinking that even if he is convicted he would be dealt with leniently by  the Court. For lessening the high rate of motor accidents due to careless and callous driving of vehicles, the courts are expected to consider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence if the prosecution is able to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

12) In the light of the above principles, we express our inability to accept the reasoning of the High Court in reducing the sentence of imprisonment to the period already undergone, that is, 15 days. Merely because the fine amount has been enhanced to Rs.25,000/- each, is also not a sufficient ground to drastically reduce the sentence, particularly, in a case where five persons died due to the negligent act of both the drivers of the bus and the truck. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and impose a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for six months with a fine of Rs.

5,000/- each. The trial Court is directed to take appropriate steps for surrender of the accused in both the appeals to serve  the remaining period of sentence. The appeals are allowed to the extent mentioned above.",1,
MUNAGALA YADAMMA,"2. The appellant's husband, Shri Munagala Anjaiah, son of Gandaian, resident of Ranga Reddy District in Andhra Pradesh, was served with a Detention Order dated 15th February, 2011, under Section 3(1) read with Section 2A and B of the Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot Leggers Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986.

3. In the Detention Order, the Detaining Authority indicated that the detenue was a bootlegger within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the aforesaid Act and that recourse to  Crl.A.67/12 normal legal procedure would involve more time and would not be an effective deterrent in preventing the detenue from indulging in further prejudicial activities.

4. It has been mentioned that the detenue was involved in several cases of violation of the provisions of Section 7A read with Section 8(C) of the Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act, 1995, involving illicit distillation of liquor.

5. The Detention Order passed by the Collector and District Magistrate, Ranga Reddy District, was questioned by the wife of the detenue by way of WP No.13313 of 2011 before the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which dismissed the same on the ground that under the normal laws, it would be difficult to check the activities of the detenue and, accordingly, the order of detention was justified.

6. The order of the High Court has been challenged before us in this appeal.

7. On behalf of the appellant, it has been urged that the ground taken for issuance of the Detention Order was improper and not available in view of the reasoned judgment of this Court in the case of Rekha Vs. State of Tamil Nadu through Secretary to Government and Anr., 2011(5)SCC 244, where a similar question had arisen and in paragraph 23 of the  Crl.A.67/12 judgment, a three-Judge Bench of this Court was of the view that criminal cases were already going on against the detenue under various provisions of the Penal Code, 1860, as well as under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and that if he was found guilty, he would be convicted and given appropriate sentence. Their Lordships also indicated that in their opinion, the ordinary law of the land was sufficient to deal with the situation, and hence, recourse to the preventive detention law was illegal.

8. It has been submitted by Mr. Anil Kumar Tandale, learned advocate appearing for the appellant, that in the instant case also all the offences alleged to have been committed by the husband of the appellant, were under the provisions of the A.P. Prohibition Act, 1995, for which the normal law was sufficient to deal with the offence, if proved. He submitted that the Detaining Authority had wrongfully taken the easy way out and had resorted to an order of preventive detention in order to avoid having to investigate the cases filed against the appellant.

9. On behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh, another decision of a two-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of G.Reddelah Vs. The Govt.of Andhra Pradesh and Anr.,  Crl.A.67/12 [2011(10)SCALE 224], was brought to our notice, in which while referring to the three-Judge Bench decision in Rekha's case (supra) their Lordships were of the opinion that in view of the factual position and the enormous activities of the detenue, violating various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act and Rules, continuous and habitual pursuing of the same type of offences damaging the wealth of the nation, the decision in Rekha's case (supra) was not applicable to the facts of the said case. Accordingly, the order passed by the Detaining Authority, as approved by the Division Bench and upheld by the High Court, did not require any interference.

10. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties, we are unable to accept the submissions made on behalf of the State in view of the fact that the decision in Rekha's case (supra), in our view, clearly covers the facts of this case as well. The offences complained of against the appellant are of a nature which can be dealt with under the ordinary law of the land. Taking recourse to the provisions of preventive detention is contrary to the constitutional guarantees enshrined in Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution and sufficient grounds have to be made out  Crl.A.67/12 by the detaining authorities to invoke such provisions. In fact, recently, in Criminal Appeal No.26 of 2012, Yumman Ongbi Lembi Leima Vs. State of Manipur & Ors., we had occasion to consider the same issue and the three-Judge Bench had held that the personal liberty of an individual is the most precious and prized right guaranteed under the Constitution in Part III thereof. The State has been granted the power to curb such rights under criminal laws, as also under the laws of preventive detention, which, therefore, are required to be exercised with due caution as well as upon a proper appreciation of the facts as to whether such acts are in any way prejudicial to the interest and the security of the State and its citizens, or seek to disturb public law and order, warranting the issuance of such an order.

11. No doubt, the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant are such as to attract punishment under the Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act, but that in our view has to be done under the said laws and taking recourse to preventive detention laws would not be warranted. Preventive detention involves detaining of a person without trial in order to prevent him/her from committing certain types of offences. But such detention cannot be made a substitute for the  Crl.A.67/12 ordinary law and absolve the investigating authorities of their normal functions of investigating crimes which the detenue may have committed. After all, preventive detention in most cases is for a year only and cannot be used as an instrument to keep a person in perpetual custody without trial. Accordingly, while following the three-Judge Bench decision in Rekha's case (supra), we allow the appeal and set aside the order passed by the High Court dated 20th July, 2011, and also quash the Detention Order dated 15th February, 2011, issue by the Collector and District Magistrate, Ranga Reddy District, Andhra Pradesh.

12. This order should not in any way prejudice the outcome of the pending cases against the appellant.",0,
ARUP DAS & ORS. ,"1. A short but interesting question of law arises in these Special Leave Petitions, as to whether  appointments can be made in Government service beyond the number of vacancies advertised.

2. An advertisement dated 4th November, 2006, was published by the Director of Land Records and Survey, Assam, inviting applications for selection for admission in the Assam Survey and Settlement Training Institute in respect of 160 seats. About 12,000 candidates applied for the said advertised seats and a written test was conducted which was followed by a viva voce examination. The viva voce test was limited to only 560 candidates. The restriction of the vive voce test to only 560 candidates was challenged before the Gauhati High Court in W.P.(C)No.3419 of 2007, which was dismissed and Writ Appeal No.413 of 2007 preferred from the Order of the learned Single Judge was also dismissed. The Director of Land Records and Survey, Assam, published a select list of 160 candidates and sent the candidates for training.

Subsequently, the Director sent three more lists, hereinafter referred to as ""the second, third and fourth lists"", but the same were not approved by the Government. The Government's refusal to approve the second, third and fourth lists against the seats available, was again challenged in Writ Petition Nos.3812 of 2010 and 2279 of 2011 on the ground that when vacancies were available, there was no bar in the same being filled up from the Select List of 560 candidates.

3. The aforesaid case sought to be made out on behalf of the Petitioners was contested by the Respondents on the ground that even if there were vacant seats available, the same could not have been filled up beyond the number of seats advertised as such action would be contrary to the law laid down by this Court relating to deviation from the contents of the advertisement.

4. The submissions made on behalf of the Writ Petitioners were rejected by the learned Single Judge upon holding that if any appointment was to be made beyond the number of seats advertised, the Director was required to publish a fresh advertisement for selecting the next batch of candidates in accordance with Rule 20 of the Rules in this regard. The learned Single Judge also observed that it was evident from the judgment and order dated 29th January, 2010 passed in W.P. (C) No.3909 of 2009, as well as the order dated 1st December, 2007 passed in Writ Appeal No.413 of 2007, that 560 candidates were called for the viva voce test for the 160 seats which had been advertised and if other candidates from the second, third and fourth lists were to be admitted, it would amount to depriving other candidates, who had not been called for the viva voce test because of the Government's decision to limit the number of candidates in the written test, of an opportunity  of being selected. Some of the candidates may have, in the meantime, acquired the eligibility to undergo such training. Relying on the decision of this Court in Union of India Vs. Ishwar Singh Khatri & Ors. [(1992) Supp.3 SCC 84] and several other judgments expressing the same view, the learned Single Judge held that filling up of vacancies over and above the number of vacancies advertised would be contrary to the provisions of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. On the basis of the above, the learned Single Judge dismissed the said Writ Petitions.

5. The decision of the learned Single Judge was challenged by the Writ Petitioners in Writ Appeal No.132 of 2011 before the Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court, along with Writ Appeal No.151 of 2011, which were dismissed by the Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court by the judgment impugned herein dated 16.9.2011. Agreeing with the views  expressed by the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench dismissed the Writ Appeals against which these Special Leave Petitions have been filed.

6. Appearing in support of the Special Leave Petitions, Mr. Joydeep Gupta, learned Senior Advocate, submitted that both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court had proceeded on the wrong premise that despite available vacancies, selection could not be made against the seats available beyond those mentioned in the advertisement. Mr. Gupta submitted that the legal position to the contrary had been clarified by this Court in Civil Appeal No.3423 of 1996, Prem Singh & Ors. Vs. Haryana State Electricity Board & Ors. [(1996) 4 SCC 319], where the following two questions fell for consideration, namely,

(i) Whether it was open to the Board to prepare a list of as many as 212 candidates and appoint as many as 137 out  of that list when the number of posts advertised was only 62?

(ii) Whether the High Court was justified in quashing the selection of all the 212 candidates and appointment of 137?

7. While deciding the matter, this Court referred to various earlier decisions in which the view expressed by this Court that appointments or selections could not be made beyond the number of posts advertised, was reiterated. One of the decisions which was relied upon was the decision rendered by this Court in Madan Lal Vs. State of J&K [(1995) 3 SCC 486], where one of the questions which fell for consideration was whether preparation of a merit list of 20 candidates against 11 advertised vacancies was bad. The learned Judge observed that this Court had held that the said action of the Commission by itself was not bad, but at the time of giving actual  appointments, the merit list was to be so operated that only 11 vacancies were filled up. It was further observed that the reason given for such a finding was that as the requisition was for 11 vacancies, the consequent advertisement and recruitment could also be for 11 vacancies and no more. The learned Judges went on to quote a passage from the decision in Madan Lal's case (supra) which is extracted hereinbelow :-

""It is easy to visualise that if requisition is for 11 vacancies and that results in the initiation of recruitment process by way of advertisement, whether the advertisement mentions filling up of 11 vacancies or not, the prospective candidates can easily find out from the Office of the Commission that the requisition for the proposed recruitment is for filling up 11 vacancies. In such a case a given candidate may not like to compete for diverse reasons but if requisition is for larger number of vacancies for which recruitment is initiated, he may like to compete.

Consequently the actual appointments to the posts have to be confined to the posts for recruitment to which requisition is sent by the Government. In such an eventuality, candidates in excess of 11  who are lower in the merit list of candidates can only be treated as wait-

listed candidates in order of merit to fill only the 11 vacancies for which recruitment has been made, in the event of any higher candidate not being available to fill the 11 vacancies, for any reason.

Once the 11 vacancies are filled by candidates taken in order of merit from the select list that list will get exhausted, having served its purpose.""

8. Referring to the observations made in the aforesaid extract, the learned Judges went on to state that while making the aforesaid observations, this Court had agreed with the contention that while sending a requisition for recruitment to posts, the Government can keep in view not only actual vacancies then existing, but also anticipated vacancies. Based on its aforesaid findings, the learned Judges went on to observe as follows:-

""25. From the above discussion of the case-law it becomes clear that the selection process by way of requisition and advertisement can be started for clear vacancies and also for anticipated vacancies but not for future vacancies. If  the requisition and advertisement are for a certain number of posts only the State cannot make more appointments than the number of posts advertised, even though it might have prepared a select list of more candidates. The State can deviate from the advertisement and make appointments on posts falling vacant thereafter in exceptional circumstances only or in an emergent situation and that too by taking a policy decision in that behalf. Even when filling up of more posts than advertised is challenged the court may not, while exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction, invalidate the excess appointments and may mould the relief in such a manner as to strike a just balance between the interest of the State and the interest of persons seeking public employment. What relief should be granted in such cases would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
26. In the present case, as against the 62 advertised posts the Board made appointments on 138 posts. The selection process was started for 62 clear vacancies and at that time anticipated vacancies were not taken into account. Therefore, strictly speaking, the Board was not appointments pursuant to the advertisement published on 2-11-1991 and the selection process which followed thereafter. But as the Board could have taken into account not only the actual vacancies but also vacancies which were likely to arise because of retirement etc. by the time the  selection process was completed it would not be just and equitable to invalidate all the appointments made on posts in excess of 62. However, the appointments which were made against future vacancies --

in this case on posts which were newly created -- must be regarded as invalid. As stated earlier, after the selection process had started 13 posts had become vacant because of retirement and 12 because of deaths. The vacancies which were likely to arise as a result of retirement could have been reasonably anticipated by the Board. The Board through oversight had not taken them into consideration while a requisition was made for filling up 62 posts. Even with respect to the appointments made against vacancies which arose because of deaths, a lenient view can be taken and on consideration of expediency and equity they need not be quashed. Therefore, in view of the special facts and circumstances of this case we do not think it proper to invalidate the appointments made on those 25 additional posts. But the appointments made by the Board on posts beyond 87 are held invalid.

Though the High Court was right in the view it has taken, we modify its order to the aforesaid extent. These appeals are allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.""

9. Mr. Gupta urged that in view of the fact that this Court had approved the right of the State to deviate from the advertisement published and to  make appointments to posts falling vacant thereafter in exceptional circumstances only or in an emergent situation, the Director of Land Records and Survey, Assam, had not committed any illegality in publishing the second, third and fourth lists for the purpose of making appointments therefrom against the total number of known vacancies numbering 690. Mr. Gupta submitted that both the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court had completely misconstrued the decision in Prem Singh's case (supra), although the same had been cited before them. Accordingly, the decisions, both of the Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench, were liable to be set aside with appropriate directions to the State Government and its authorities to take steps to fill up the total number of vacancies from the second, third and fourth lists published by the Director, Land Records and Survey, Assam.

10. Having carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioners, we are unable to accept Mr. Gupta's submissions, since the issue raised by him is no longer res integra and has been well settled by a series of decisions of this Court after the decision in Prem Singh's case (supra).

Even in Prem Singh's case, which has been strongly relied upon by Mr. Gupta, the proposition sought to be advanced by him does not find support. It is well-established that an authority cannot make any selection/appointment beyond the number of posts advertised, even if there were a larger number of posts available than those advertised. The principle behind the said decision is that if that was allowed to be done, such action would be entirely arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, since other candidates who had chosen not to apply for the vacant posts which were being sought to be filled, could have also applied if they had known that the other vacancies  would also be under consideration for being filled up. In fact, in the decision rendered in Ishwar Singh Khatri's case (supra) which was referred to by the High Court, this Court while considering the preparation of panel of 1492 selected candidates as against the 654 actual vacancies notified, recorded the fact that after filling up the notified number of vacancies from the panel, no further appointments were made therefrom and instead fresh advertisement was issued for further appointment.

Since a promise had been made in the minutes of the meeting of the Selection Board that the panel would be valid till all the candidates were offered appointments, this Court held that the Selection Board had taken into consideration anticipated vacancies while preparing the panel. It is on such basis that this Court had observed that it had to be concluded that the Selection Board had prepared the panels containing 1492 candidates, as against the then available vacancies, and, accordingly, the  selected candidates had a right to get appointment.

It is in such circumstances that further appointments from the published panel of 1492 candidates, as directed by the Tribunal, were upheld.

11. In a recent decision rendered by this Court in State of U.P. Vs. Raj Kumar Sharma [(2006) 3 SCC 330], this Court once again had to consider the question of filling up of vacancies over and above the number of vacancies advertised. Referring to the various decisions rendered on this issue, this Court held that filling up of vacancies over and above the number of vacancies advertised would be violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and that selectees could not claim appointments as a matter of right. It was reiterated that mere inclusion of candidates in the Select List does not confer any right to be selected, even if some of  the vacancies remained unfilled. This Court went on to observe further that even if in some cases appointments had been made by mistake or wrongly, that did not confer any right of appointment to another person, as Article 14 of the Constitution does not envisage negative equality and if the State had committed a mistake, it cannot be forced to perpetuate the said mistake.

12. Even the decision in Prem Singh's case (supra), which had been strongly relied upon by Mr. Joydeep Gupta in support of his claim that the State had a right to deviate from the advertisement published by it, has to be considered in the light of the circumstances in which the same was made. While holding that if the requisition and advertisement are for a certain number of posts only, the State cannot make more appointments than the number of posts, this Court went on to hold that the State could deviate from the advertisement and make  appointments in posts falling vacant thereafter in exceptional cases or in an emergent situation, and, that too, by taking a policy decision in that behalf. The said finding cannot possibly be interpreted in the manner in which it has been done by Mr. Gupta that the advertisement could be deviated from by the State, even in the present circumstances, which, in our view, were neither exceptional nor emergent. The fact that 690 seats were available is not a relevant consideration for application of the aforesaid principle. It is in such situation that a fresh advertisement is required to be published for filling up the remaining number of vacancies after the vacancies advertised are filled up. The latter portion of paragraph 25 of the said decision in Prem Singh's case (supra) deals with a situation where posts in excess of those advertised had been filled up in extra-ordinary circumstances. In such a case it was observed that instead of invalidating the  excess appointments, the relief could be moulded in such a manner so as to strike a just balance, if it is in the interest of the State and in the interest of the person seeking public employment, to the facts of such case. The facts of that case are different from the facts of the instant case, in that no extra-ordinary and/or exceptional circumstances exist in the present case requiring the filling up of the vacant seats available after filling up the 160 seats advertised. The decision in Prem Singh's case (supra) has to be read in such a context and cannot be said to be the rule, but rather the exception.

13. We, therefore, are not inclined to accept Mr. Gupta's submissions, which deal with the exception and not the rule and, accordingly, the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed. Consequently, the application filed by the Petitioner Nos.4 to 58 for  permission to file the Special Leave Petition is rejected.

order dated 06.08.2010 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 28420 of 2009 whereby the High Court has granted bail to Mr. Ramakant Yadav - respondent No.2/accused in Case Crime No. 622 of 2009, FIR No. 63 of 2009 under Sections 302  and 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short `IPC'), Police Station Phoolpur, District Azamgarh, U.P.

3)     Brief facts:


(a)    According   to   the   appellant,   he   is   the   President   of   a 



political party, namely, Rashtriya Ulema Council. On 12.08.2009, a meeting of the Party was to be held at Phoolpur, District Azamgarh, U.P. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and he was to attend the said meeting in the capacity of Chief Guest.

b) At about 1.45 p.m., the appellant started towards the venue of the meeting and his convoy was being led by 10 to 15 supporters who were riding on motorcycles. At that moment, the second respondent/accused came from behind in the convoy of cars and immediately after crossing the appellant's car and his supporters, the convoy of cars belonging to the second respondent/accused suddenly stopped on the road without giving any signal and the second respondent/accused came out of his vehicle armed with a gun along with his supporters who were also carrying guns and they started giving kick blows to one of the motorcycle riders who fell down and the pillion riders of the said motorcycles were fired upon  by the second respondent and his supporters from their respective guns and thereafter, they ran away from the place.

Adbul Rehman-the pillion rider sustained serious fire arm injuries. When he was taken to the hospital at Varanasi, he succumbed to his injuries.

c) On the basis of a written complaint in the Police Station, Phoolpur, FIR No. 63 of 2009 under Sections 302 and 307 IPC was registered. The second respondent was arrested only on 24.08.2009. It was further stated by the appellant that the accused is a habitual criminal and has a criminal background having more than three dozen cases involving serious offences against him. The second respondent filed a Criminal Bail Application being No. 28420 of 2009 before the High Court praying for his release. The appellant filed his objection. He also highlighted that from 14.08.2009, the appellant started receiving threatening calls from the second respondent warning him not to pursue the case otherwise he shall be eliminated.

d) On completion of the investigation, charge sheet was filed on 15.07.2010 against respondent No.2 and three other  persons under Sections 302, 307 and 325 read with 34 IPC and the trial of the case has been started by examining the injured witness - Farhan as PW-1 on 29.04.2010 and 15.07.2010.

e) Pending proceeding of the trial, the High Court, by impugned order dated 06.08.2010, granted conditional bail to the second respondent. Questioning the same and of the fact that the appellant had received several threat calls, he filed the present appeal for setting aside the same.

4) Heard Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Mr. Basava Prabhu S. Patil, learned senior counsel for the contesting second respondent.

5) The only point for consideration in this appeal is whether the High Court was justified in enlarging the second respondent on bail after imposing certain conditions.

6) It is not in dispute and highlighted that the second respondent is a sitting Member of Parliament facing several criminal cases. It is also not in dispute that most of the cases ended in acquittal for want of proper witnesses or pending trial. As observed by the High Court, merely on the basis of  criminal antecedents, the claim of the second respondent cannot be rejected. In other words, it is the duty of the Court to find out the role of the accused in the case in which he has been charged and other circumstances such as possibility of fleeing away from the jurisdiction of the Court etc.

7) In the case relating to FIR No. 63 of 2009, he was arrested and in jail since 24.08.2009. Another important aspect is that after filing of charge-sheet on 15.07.2010, prosecution examined two important witnesses as PWs 1 and

2. This was the position prevailing on 26.07.2010. Even thereafter, now more than a year has rolled. Counsel appearing for the State assured that the trial will not be prolonged at the instance of the prosecution and ready to complete the evidence within a period to be directed by this Court. The other objection of the appellant for grant of bail is that he had received threats from the second respondent and his supporters warning him not to pursue the case against him. It is brought to our notice that based on the representations of the appellant, adequate protection had already been provided to him.

8) Taking note of all these aspects, particularly, the fact that the second respondent was in jail since 24.08.2009, the trial has commenced by examining the two witnesses on the side of the prosecution and the assurance by the State that trial will not be prolonged and conclude within a reasonable time and also of the fact that the High Court while granting bail has imposed several conditions for strict adherence during the period of bail, we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the High Court. In fact, in the impugned order itself, the High Court has made it clear that in case of breach of any of the conditions, the trial Court will have liberty to take steps to send the applicant therein (respondent No.2 herein) to jail again. In addition to the same, it is further made clear that if the appellant receives any fresh threat from the second respondent or from his supporters, he is free to inform the trial Court and in such event the trial Court is free to take appropriate steps as observed by the High Court. We also direct the Trial Court to complete the trial within a period of four months from the date of the receipt of copy of this order without unnecessary adjournments.

9) With the above observation, finding no merit for interference with the order of the High Court, the appeal is dismissed.",0,
STATE OF M.P. & ANR.,"2. On March 23, 2001, a gang of four criminals comprising of Rambabu Gadariya, Dayaram, Pratap and Gopal, while returning from Dabra to Gwalior after attending court, escaped from the police custody. Allegedly, these four criminals escaped with the help and connivance of the police officers and/or negligence/inaction of the guards escorting them. After escaping from the police custody, these four criminals murdered 14 persons in village Bhanwarpura. This led to harassment and torture of persons from gadariya  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) (Baghel) caste by the police. They initially filed complaint with the District Judge, but later on the first respondent-Ram Prakash Singh filed a Writ Petition (being Writ Petition No. 747 of 2001) in the nature of Public Interest Litigation before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Gwalior.

3. In that Writ Petition, it was alleged that after escape of four dacoits noted above from police custody, the police has started torturing the persons from Baghel community in the Gwalior district. Accordingly, it was prayed that the State of Madhya Pradesh and its functionaries (respondents therein) be directed to refrain from causing torture to the people of Baghel Samaj in the district of Gwalior and directions be issued for protection of their life and liberty.

4. The matter came up for consideration before the High Court on various dates. As the matter was in the nature of public interest litigation and the grievance was raised that the above criminals after their escape were causing havoc and they have not been taken into custody by the police which has caused huge fear in the minds of the people of the area, the High Court issued various directions from time to time. The High Court asked the State Government to hold an enquiry into the escape of above  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) criminals from the police custody and submit the report regarding action taken against the officers responsible for the lapse. Despite numerous opportunities, the State Government failed to respond to the directions given by the High Court satisfactorily which constrained the High Court to direct the Director General of Police, Madhya Pradesh, to remain present in the Court. It appears that the Advocate General of the State of Madhya Pradesh made a statement before the High Court that the enquiry into the episode shall be conducted by a very senior office of the State and report submitted to the Court. However, nothing happened in the matter. The High Court then called the Principal Secretary (Home) in the Court. The Principal Secretary (Home) appeared and made a statement that the enquiry into the matter shall be conducted within a period of two months from March 9, 2004. On June 30, 2004, on behalf of the State Government, time was sought for submission of the enquiry report, but no enquiry report was submitted. In the backdrop of consistent inaction on the part of the State Government in the matter, on November 8, 2004, the High Court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to hold enquiry into the matter of escape of the above criminals from the police custody and the role of the officers posted at Gwalior, particularly the role of  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, Inspector General of Police, Gwalior, Superintendent, Central Jail, Gwalior, Jailor, Central Jail, Gwalior, District Magistrate, Gwalior, Town Inspector, Gwalior and Sub-Divisional Officer posted at Dabra. It is this order which has been challenged by the State of Madhya Pradesh and Superintendent of Police in this Appeal, by special leave.

5. On December 17, 2004, this Court issued notice to the respondents and stayed operation of the order of the High Court impugned in the Appeal.

6. On November 28, 2007, this Court directed the Chief Secretary, State of Madhya Pradesh, to appoint the Additional Chief Secretary to conclude the enquiry into the matter as expeditiously as possible and in any event within three months from the date of the order and submit a report to this Court.

7. In pursuance of the order dated November 28, 2007, an enquiry has been conducted by Shri Rakesh Bansal, IAS, President Board of Revenue, Gwalior.

8. In his report dated May 29, 2008, the President Board of Revenue, Gwalior, recorded his conclusions thus :-

""10. ..., I reach to the conclusion that the then S.P. Shri Anvesh Manglam, can not be held responsible for the incident of escape of dacoits from police custody.
Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004)
13. ...., I reach to the conclusion that Shri Yogesh Choudhary and Shri K.P. Sharma the then Deputy Superintendent of Police (Headquarters) can not be held responsible for this incident of escape of Gadaria gang from police custody.

14. ... For the whole chain of events, most responsible person is Reserve Inspector Ajay Tripathi only.

15. It is worth to mention here that Government has already dismissed/compulsorily retired from service two Head Constables and four constables deployed in the escort duty of dacoits for carrying them for appearance before court at the time of their escape.""

9. It appears that the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the Reserve Inspector Ajay Tripathi have not been taken to logical conclusion in view of the stay order obtained by him in a judicial proceeding.

10. In his report, Shri Rakesh Bansal, IAS, President Board of Revenue, Gwalior has also made certain suggestions in order to prevent repetition of such incident. These suggestions are :-

""16(1) It should be provided in the Rules that dangerous prisoners must not be taken out of jail for journey by public transport vehicles or private vehicles, under any circumstances.
(2) Keeping in view the possibility of escape during transport of prisoners, it  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) appear to be prudent that one regular court room be constructed in proximity to the central Jails.

The suggestion of the same intent has also been mentioned by the then Commissioner of Gwalior Division in his enquiry report on the page 27.

(3) It must be provided in the Jail Manual, that whenever any dangerous or sensitive prisoner is to be transferred from one jail to another jail, for court appearance or on administrative grounds, the jail superintendent should inform the concerned Superintendent of Police and District Magistrate vide a demi-official letter and by meeting them personally.""

11. No affidavit has been filed by the present appellants indicating whether the above suggestions of the President, Board of Revenue, have been accepted by the State Government or not. However, Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel for the appellants, submited that the State Government did not have any reservation in accepting the suggestions made by the President, Board of Revenue, in his report as noted above.

12. As regards the arrest of the above criminals who escaped from police custody on March 23, 2001, in the additional affidavit filed by U.R. Netam, I.G. of Police, Police Headquarters, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, dated April 01, 2007, it has been stated that 4 out of 5 dacoits of the gang  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) have been killed in police encounters and only Rambabu Gadaria is believed to be alive. It has also been stated that all the weapons snatched by the above criminals while escaping from police custody have been recovered.

13. Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel for the appellants, stated that Criminal Writ Petition No. 747 of 2001 was still pending before the High Court.

14. Having regard to the fact that the order dated November 8, 2004 whereby the High Court directed the matter to be referred to CBI for holding enquiry into the matter of escape of above criminals from the police custody and the role of various officers posted at Gwalior has been stayed by this Court way back in the year 2004, and in 2007 the direction was given to the Chief Secretary, Madhya Pradesh to appoint the Additional Chief Secretary to conduct the enquiry into the above matter and pursuant thereto Shri Rakesh Bansal, IAS, President Board of Revenue, Gwalior, was nominated by the Chief Secretary to hold the enquiry and he has already held the enquiry and submitted his report dated May 29, 2008, we are satisfied that the direction given by the High Court to refer the matter to CBI to hold an enquiry into the matter has lost its relevance. We, accordingly, set aside the said direction.

15. The escape of four dreaded criminals from the police  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) custody and the murder of 14 innocent persons by these criminals after their escape are extremely serious matters. In the matter as grave as this, the State Government was expected to act promptly by taking action against the erring police officials but it failed to act, necessitating drastic order by the High Court. Though we have set aside the order of the High Court impugned in this Appeal for the reasons noted above, but the handling of the matter by the State Government and its functionaries has been far from satisfactory. We would like the State Government to take appropriate action against the erring official/s without any further delay and also take all remedial measures to ensure that such things do not happen in future.

16. We direct the first appellant-State of Madhya Pradesh, as suggested in the report submitted by Shri Rakesh Bansal; (i) to make amendment in the existing rules and provide that dangerous prisoners shall not be taken out of jail for journey by public transport vehicles or private vehicles under any circumstances, and (ii) provide in the Jail Manual that whenever any dangerous or sensitive prisoner is to be transferred from one jail to another jail, for court appearance or on administrative grounds, the Jail Superintendent should inform the concerned Superintendent of Police and District Magistrate by a written communication as  Criminal Appeal NO. 104 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004) well as by meeting them. We also direct that the State Government shall, in consultation with the High Court, take a decision about construction of single court room complexes for holding trial of dreaded criminals/dangerous prisoners in proximity to the Central Jails.

17. The Action Taken Report about compliance of the above directions shall be submitted by the first appellant before the High Court.

18. With the above directions, Appeal stands disposed of.

19. It shall be open to the High Court to issue further directions, if necessary, in Criminal Writ Petition No. 747 of 2001, which is said to be still pending before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Gwalior.",0,
Dr. MRS. NUPUR TALWAR,"1. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.

2. Leave granted.

3. The subject matter of challenge before this Court is an order dated 18th March, 2011 of the Allahabad High Court whereby the High Court on a petition under Section 397/401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (hereinafter `Code') challenging the order dated 9th February, 2011 passed by Special Judicial Magistrate (CBI), Ghaziabad in Special Case No.01 of 2011 (Rajesh Talwar Vs. Unknown under Section 302, I.P.C. P.S. S.C.B.

C.B.I., Delhi) refused to interfere with Magistrate's order of taking cognizance.

4. By the said order dated 9th February, 2011, the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offences under Sections 302/34 and 201/34 I.P.C.

against the appellant and one Dr. Rajesh Talwar.

The concluding portion of the order of the Magistrate is:-

""While rejecting the conclusion given in the Final Report by the Investigating Officer, cognizance on the basis of Police report under section 190(1)(b) of Cr.P.C.  is taken under section 302/34 and 201/34 IPC against accused Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar for committing murders of Arushi and Hem Raj and for tampering with the proofs. The accused be summoned for appearance on 28.02.2011. Copies be prepared.""
5. The entire case arises out of an unfortunate murder of a young girl namely, `Aarushi' in her own residence and also the murder of one Hemraj, a domestic help. It appears that the said unfortunate murder of the young girl raised some kind of a sensation in public mind and an uproar.

Be that as it may, sitting in the Courts of law, we have to steer clear of the public debate and follow the course of law.

6. Initially, the investigation was conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Police in which the implication of Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar, parents of the deceased victim girl transpired. Thereafter, the investigation of the case was handed over to the C.B.I. on 29th May,  2008 on the basis of a notification by the State.

Prior to that, on 23rd May, 2008, Dr. Rajesh Talwar was arrested. The CBI initially filed a closure report of the investigation. On the basis of that report, an application was filed by the C.B.I. under Section 169 of the Code before the Special Judicial Magistrate, C.B.I., Ghaziabad.

The contents of the said petition read as under:

""i. That accused Rajesh Talwar was arrested in the aforesaid case on 23.5.2008. Subsequently, following expiry of his police remand, this Hon'ble Court remanded him to judicial custody upto 11.7.2008 vide order dated 2.7.2008.
ii. That the investigation of this case is still pending and all the facts and circumstances of the case are being investigated.
iii. That during investigation, the role of accused Rajesh Talwar was thoroughly investigated regarding the aforesaid crime.
iv. That during investigation, the poly right to psychological analysis test of accused Rajesh Talwar was conducted and no deception has been found in the test reports.
v. That during investigation, the cloths, shoes and finger palm/foot prints of accused Rajesh Talwar was forwarded/submitted to CFSL, New Delhi for examination and expert opinion. The Scientific examination results could not connect accused Rajesh Talwar with the crime.
vi. That in view of the above circumstances, the further judicial custody remand of accused Rajesh Talwar is not required in the interest of justice.
Prayer It is, therefore, prayed that Judicial custody remand of accused Rajesh Talwar may not be extended.""
7. On the basis of the aforementioned prayer of C.B.I. under Section 169 of the Code, an order came to be passed on 11th July, 2008 by the learned Magistrate and Dr. Rajesh Talwar was released on his furnishing two sureties of Rs.5 lakh each with a personal bond of the same amount.

8. Thereafter, the C.B.I. filed another closure  report on 29th December, 2010. Then, on a notice being issued by the Court, a protest petition came to be filed by Dr. Rajesh Talwar. Only thereafter, the impugned order of the Magistrate dated 9th February, 2011 came to be passed. The learned Magistrate in his detailed order after considering various aspects of the matter took cognizance of the offence and passed the order, quoted above.

9. It is apparent from the detailed order that the Magistrate rejected the conclusion given in the official report of the Investigating Officer and took cognizance under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code.

10. Attention of this Court has been drawn to various parts of the CBI closure report and certain other documents by Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant.

11. Sitting in a jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution, we do not feel inclined to go into all the factual aspects of the case.

Obviously at this stage we cannot weigh evidence.

Looking into the order of Magistrate, we find that he applied his mind in coming to the conclusion relating to taking of cognizance. The Magistrate has taken note of the rejection report and gave his prima facie observation on the controversy upon a consideration of the materials that surfaced in the case. We reproduce the conclusions reached by the Special Judicial Magistrate.

""From the analysis of evidence of all above mentioned witnesses prima facie it appears that after investigation, on the basis of evidence available in the case diary when this incident occurred at that time four members were present in the house--Dr. Rajesh Talwar, Dr. Nupur Talwar, Arushi and servant Hem Raj; Arushi and Hem Raj, the two out of four were found dead.
In the case diary there is no such evidence from which it may appear that some person had made forcible entry and  there is no evidence regarding involvement of the servants. In the night of the incident, Internet was switched on and off in the house in regard to which this evidence is available in the case diary that it was switched on or off by some person. Private parts of deceased Arushi were cleaned and deceased Hem Raj was dragged in injured condition from the flat of Dr. Rajesh Talwar up to the terrace and the terrace was locked. Prior to 15.5.2008, terrace was not locked.

According to documents available on the case diary, blood stains were wiped off on the staircase, both the deceased were slit with the help of a surgical instrument by surgically trained persons and shape of injury on the head and forehead was V shaped and according to the evidence available in the case diary that appeared to have been caused with a golf stick. A person coming from outside, during the presence of Talwar couple in the house could have neither used the Internet nor could have taken the dead body of deceased Hem Raj to the terrace and then locked when the Talwar couple was present in the house. On the basis of evidence available in the case diary footprints stained with blood were found in the room of Arushi but outside that room bloodstained footprints were not found. If the assailant would go out after committing murder then certainly his footprints would not be confined up to the room of Arushi and for an outsider it is not possible that when Talwar couple were present in the house he would use liquor or would try to take dead body on the terrace. Accused after committing the offence would like to run away immediately so that no one could catch him.

On the basis of evidence of all the above witnesses and circumstantial evidence available in case diary during investigation it was expected from the Investigating Officer to submit charge-

sheet against Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar. In such type of cases, when offence is committed inside a house, there direct evidence cannot be expected. Here it is pertinent to mention that CBI is the highest investigating agency of the country in which the public of the country has full confidence. Whenever in a case if any one of the investigating agencies of the country remained unsuccessful then that case is referred to CBI for investigation. In such circumstances, it is expected of CBI that applying the highest standards, after investigation it should submit such a report before the Court which is just and reasonable on the basis of evidence collected in investigation, but it was not done so by the CBI which is highly disappointing. If I draw a conclusion from the circumstances of case diary, then I find that in view of the facts, the conclusion of the investigating officer that on account of lack of evidence, case may be closed; does not appear to be just and proper. When offence was committed inside a house, on the basis of evidence received from case diary, a link is made from these circumstances, and these links are indicating prima facie the accused Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar to be guilty. The evidence of witness Shoharat that Dr. Rajesh Talwar asked him to paint the wooden portion of a wall between the rooms of Arushi and Dr. Rajesh Talwar, indicates towards the conclusion that he wants to tamper with the evidence. From  the evidence ... so many in the case diary, prima facie evidence is found in this regard. Therefore, in the light of above evidences conclusion of Investigating Officer given in the final report deserves to be rejected and there is sufficient basis for taking prima facie cognizance against Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar for committing murder of deceased Arushi and Hem Raj and for tampering with the proof. At this stage, the principle of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jagdish Ram Vs. State of Rajasthan and another, reported in AIR 2004 SC 1734 is very important wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that investigation is the job of police and taking of cognizance is within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. If on the record, this much of evidence is available that prima facie cognizance can be taken then the Magistrate should take cognizance. Magistrate should be convinced that there is enough basis for further proceedings rather for sufficient basis for proving the guilt.""

12. Assailing the said order, a Criminal Revision was filed before the High Court under Sections 397 and 401 of the Code, not by Dr. Rajesh Talwar, father of the girl but by Dr. Mrs. Nupur Talwar, her mother.

13. The High Court passed its order dated 18th  March, 2011 after a detailed consideration of the factual aspects and legal questions involved in the matter of taking cognizance and the same order is impugned before us.

14. In the concluding portion of its order, High Court held:

""However, considering the facts of the case it is directed that in case the revisionist surrenders before the Special Judicial Magistrate (C.B.I.), Ghaziabad and applies for bail within a period of two weeks from today her bail application shall be dealt with in accordance with the law expeditiously.""
15. On the next day i.e. 19th March 2011, which was a Saturday, a Bench of this Court entertained at 7 P.M. an SLP against the High Court's order and passed the following order:-

""List on the notified date. In the meanwhile, there shall be stay as prayed for. However, the petitioners shall deposit their passports with the trial  Court on Monday i.e. 21.03.2011.""
16. Since then, the matter has remained pending before this Court.

17. Now the question is what should be the extent of judicial interference by this Court in connection with an order of taking cognizance by a Magistrate while exercising his jurisdiction under Section 190 of the Code.

18. Section 190 of the Code lays down the conditions which are requisite for the initiation of a criminal proceeding.

19. At this stage the Magistrate is required to exercise sound judicial discretion and apply his mind to the facts and materials before him. In doing so, the Magistrate is not bound by the opinion of the investigating officer and he is competent to exercise his discretion irrespective  of the views expressed by the Police in its report and may prima facie find out whether an offence has been made out or not.

20. The taking of cognizance means the point in time when a Court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence which appears to have been committed.

21. At the stage of taking of cognizance of offence, the Court has only to see whether prima facie there are reasons for issuing the process and whether the ingredients of the offence are there on record.

22. The principles relating to taking of cognizance in a criminal matter has been very lucidly explained by this Court in S.K. Sinha, Chief Enforcement Officer Vs. Videocon  International Ltd. and Ors. - (2008) 2 SCC 492, the relevant observations are set out:

""19. The expression ""cognizance"" has not been defined in the Code. But the word (cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no esoteric or mystic significance in criminal law. It merely means ""become aware of"" and when used with reference to a court or a Judge, it connotes"" to take notice of judicially"". It indicates the point when a court or a Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence with a view to initiating proceedings in respect of such offence said to have been committed by someone.""
20. ""Taking Cognizance"" does not involve any formal action of any kind. It occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence. Cognizance is taken prior to commencement of criminal proceedings. Taking of cognizance is thus a sine qua non or condition precedent for holding a valid trial. Cognizance is taken of an offence and not of an offender. Whether or not a Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and no rule of universal application can be laid down as to when a Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance.""
(para nos. 19 and 20 at page 499 of the report) 
23. The correctness of the order whereby cognizance of the offence has been taken by the Magistrate, unless it is perverse or based on no material, should be sparingly interfered with. In the instant case, anyone reading the order of the Magistrate taking cognizance, will come to the conclusion that there has been due application of mind by the Magistrate and it is a well reasoned order. The order of the High Court passed on a Criminal Revision under Sections 397 and 401 of the code (not under Section 482) at the instance of Dr. Mrs. Nupur Talwar would also show that there has been a proper application of mind and a detailed speaking order has been passed.
24. In the above state of affairs, now the question is what is the jurisdiction and specially the duty of this Court in such a situation under Article 136?

25. We feel constrained to observe that at this  stage, this Court should exercise utmost restrain and caution before interfering with an order of taking cognizance by the Magistrate,otherwise the holding of a trial will be stalled. The superior Courts should maintain this restrain to uphold the rule of law and sustain the faith of the common man in the administration of justice.

26. Reference in this connection may be made to a three Judge Bench decision of this Court in the case of M/s. India Carat Private Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka & Anr. (1989) 2 SCC 132. Explaining the relevant principles in paragraphs 16, Justice Natarajan, speaking for the unanimous three Judge Bench, explained the position so succinctly that we would rather quote the observation: as under:-

""The position is, therefore, now well settled that upon receipt of a police report under Section 173(2) a Magistrate is entitled to take cognizance of an offence under Section 190(1)(b) of the Code even if the police report is to the effect that no case is made out against  the accused. The Magistrate can take into account the statements of the witnesses examined by the police during the investigation and take cognizance of the offence complained of and order the issue of process to the accused. Section 190(1)(b) does not lay down that a Magistrate can take cognizance of an offence only if the investigating officer gives an opinion that the investigation has made out a case against the accused. The Magistrate can ignore the conclusion arrived at by the investigating officer; and independently apply his mind to the facts emerging from the investigation and take cognizance of the case, if he thinks fit, in exercise of his powers under Section 190(1)(b) and direct the issue of process to the accused...""
27. These well settled principles still hold good. Considering these propositions of law, we are of the view that we should not interfere with the concurrent order of the Magistrate which is affirmed by the High Court.

28. We are deliberately not going into various factual aspects of the case which have been raised before us so that in the trial the accused persons may not be prejudiced. We, therefore,  dismiss this appeal with the observation that in the trial which the accused persons will face, they should not be prejudiced by any observation made by us in this order or in the order of the High Court or those made in the Magistrate's order while taking cognizance. The accused must be given all opportunities in the trial they are to face. We, however, observe that the trial should be expeditiously held.

29. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.",0,
JILE SINGH ,"2. A certain Bharat Lal Sharma was done to death on October 26, 2008. His father (respondent No. 2 herein) informed the Police Station Kosikalan on the next day, i.e., October 27, 2008 at 8 a.m. that he received an information in the morning at about 7 a.m. that his son Bharat Lal Sharma had been murdered and his dead body was lying in the agricultural field of Ghure son of Gaisi, 'Jat' resident of Tumaura. On receipt of this information, he (respondent No. 2 herein ) went to the spot and found that the body of his son was lying in blood. His son was killed with some sharp edged weapon the previous night. He requested the police to register First Information Report  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011) (FIR) against unknown accused persons and take appropriate action in the matter. On this information, an FIR was registered and investigation commenced. On conclusion of the investigation, the Investigating Officer submitted charge-sheet naming one Hari Singh as an accused having committed the murder of Bharat Lal Sharma. On the basis of the material collected by the Investigating Officer, no case was found out against the present appellant-Jile Singh and the Investigating Officer concluded that the appellant has been falsely named in the course of investigation.

3. On May 2, 2009, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, committed the accused-Hari Singh to the Court of Sessions Judge, Mathura for trial. It was then that the complainant-respondent No. 2 herein filed a private complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the Code') in the court of Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, against the present appellant and one Jayveer Singh for the murder of his son Bharat Lal Sharma.

4. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, after recording the statements under Section 202 of the Code, issued summons to the appellant on January 3, 2011. Aggrieved by that order, the appellant filed Criminal Revision before the Allahabad High Court which came to be  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011) dismissed on March 10, 2011. It is from this order that the present Appeal, by special leave, has arisen.

5. Mr. Manoj Saxena, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the issuance of summons by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, on a private complaint made by the respondent No. 2 after committal of accused- Hari Singh for the murder of Bharat Lal Sharma to the Sessions Court, was without jurisdiction. He would submit that addition of a new person to the array of the accused in a case pending before the sessions court can only be done by that court in exercise of the power under Section 319 of the Code and in no other way. In this regard, he relied upon decisions of this Court in the cases of Ranjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab1 and Kishori Singh and Ors. Vs. State of Bihar and Anr.2

6. Mr. Ratnakar Dash, learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 1-State of Uttar Pradesh, and Mr. Vikram Patralekh, learned counsel for respondent No. 2- complainant, stoutly defended the impugned order. They submitted that the complaint filed by the complainant before the Magistrate was maintainable under Section 200 of the Code since the Investigating Officer on conclusion of the investigation did not name the appellant as accused 1 (1998) 7 SCC 149 2 (2004) 13 SCC 11  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011) although there was material to that effect in the course of investigation. The learned senior counsel and the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that if on receipt of a report, the police takes up the investigation of a case and on completion thereof submits a charge-sheet against few persons and leaves the other persons involved in the crime by stating in the report that no case has been made out against such person, it is open to the aggrieved complainant to file a complaint under Section 200 of the Code and the Magistrate is empowered to issue summons. In this regard, they relied upon a decision of this Court in Hareram Satpathy Vs. Tikaram Agarwala & Ors.3 Mr. Ratnakat Dash, learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 1, also referred to another decision of this Court in Kishan Lal Vs. Dharmendra Bafna & Anr.4 and submitted that if a right has been given to the complainant to be given notice of filing of the police report and to file protest petition, there is no impediment in the law for maintaining a complaint if persons involved in the crime have been left over by the police in the course of the investigation.

7. The present case, in our view, is squarely covered by the law laid down by this Court in the case of 3 1978 (4) SCC 58 4 2009 (7) SCC 685  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011) Ranjit Singh (supra) and the subsequent decision in the case of Kishori Singh (supra) reiterating the same legal position. In Ranjit Singh (supra), this Court was concerned with the issue whether the sessions court can add a new person to the array of the accused in a case pending before it at a stage prior to collecting any evidence. The three Judge Bench that considered the above issue referred to various provisions of the Code, namely, Sections 204, 207, 208, 209, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230 and 319 and held as under :

""19. So from the stage of committal till the Sessions Court reaches the stage indicated in Section 230 of the Code, that court can deal with only the accused referred to in Section 209 of the Code. There is no intermediary stage till then for the Sessions Court to add any other person to the array of the accused.
20. Thus, once the Sessions Court takes cognizance of the offence pursuant to the committal order, the only other stage when the court is empowered to add any other person to the array of the accused is after reaching evidence collection when powers under Section 319 of the Code can be invoked. We are unable to find any other power for the Sessions Court to permit addition of new person or persons to the array of the accused. Of course it is not necessary for the court to wait until the entire evidence is collected for exercising the said powers.""
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011)
8. The above legal position has been reiterated by this Court in a subsequent decision in the case of Kishori Singh (supra). The two Judge Bench in Kishori Singh (supra) considered some of the provisions of the Code and earlier decision of this Court in Ranjit Singh (supra) and two other decisions, namely, Raj Kishore Prasad Vs. State of Bihar and India Carat (P) Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka6, and held as under :-

""9. After going through the provisions of the Code of the Criminal Procedure and the aforesaid two judgments and on examining the order dated 10-6-1997 passed by the Magistrate, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the Magistrate could not have issued process against those persons who may have been named in the FIR as accused persons, but not charge-sheeted in the charge-sheet that was filed by the police under Section 173 CrPC.
10. So far as those persons against whom charge- sheet has not been filed, they can be arrayed as ""accused persons"" in exercise of powers under Section 319 CrPC when some evidence or materials are brought on record in course of trial or they could also be arrayed as ""accused persons"" only when a reference is made either by the Magistrate while passing an order of commitment or by the learned Sessions Judge to the High Court and the High Court, on examining the materials, comes to the conclusion that sufficient materials exist against them even though the police might not have filed charge-sheet, as has been explained in the latter three-Judge Bench decision. Neither of the contingencies has arisen in the case in hand.""
5 (1996) 4 SCC 495 6 (1989) 2 SCC 132  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011)
9. In the present case, if the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, in issuing summons against the appellant on the complaint filed by the respondent No. 2-complainant, which has been confirmed by the High Court, is allowed to stand, it would mean addition of the appellant to the array of the accused in a pending case before the Sessions Judge at a stage prior to collecting any evidence by that court. This course is absolutely impermissible in view of the law laid down by a three Judge Bench of this court in the case of Ranjit Singh (supra). The stage of Section 209 of the Code having reached in the case, it was not open to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura to exercise the power under Section 204(1)(b) of the Code and issue summons to the appellant. The order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura is totally without jurisdiction. The High Court was clearly in error in not keeping in view the law laid by this Court in the case of Ranjit Singh (supra) followed by a subsequent decision in the case of Kishori Singh (supra) and in upholding the illegal order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura.

10. The two decisions, namely, Hareram Satpathy (supra)and Kishan Lal (supra) relied upon by the learned  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 121 OF 2012 (arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3592 of 2011) senior counsel and counsel for the respondents have no application at all to the case in hand.

11. We, accordingly, allow this Appeal and set aside the order of the High Court dated March 10, 2011 impugned in this present Appeal and the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mathura, dated January 3, 2011.

12. Needless to say that in the course of trial, on the basis of the evidence if it appears to the Sessions Judge that any person not being the accused in the trial has committed the offence and the case is made out for exercise of power under Section 319 of the Code for proceeding against such person, it will be open to the Sessions Judge to proceed accordingly and the present order will not come in the way in exercise of his power under Section 319 of the Code.",1,
VASANTI DUBEY,"2. The appellant herein has challenged the order dated 24.1.2011 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Jabalpur by which the Criminal Revision Petition No. 839/2004 was dismissed holding therein that the impugned order passed by the Special Judge (under the Prevention of Corruption Act,  1988) District Narsinghpur did not suffer from any apparent error of jurisdiction.

3. In the backdrop of the facts and circumstances of the case to be related hereinafter, the question inter alia which falls for determination by this Court is whether the Magistrate/Special Judge could straightway direct for submission of charge-sheet in case he refused to accept final report/closure report of the police/investigating agency and thereafter direct the police to submit charge-sheet in case he was of the opinion that the case was not fit to be closed and it required to be proceeded further. The question which also requires consideration is whether the Special Judge could refuse to accept closure report and direct reinvestigation of the case for the second time in order to proceed further although he was confronted with the legal impediment indicating lack of sanction for prosecution in the matter.

4. However, the question for determination is not a new or an extra-ordinary one as the question has cropped up time and again before this Court as to what course is left open for a Magistrate in a situation when the police submits final report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. or closure report is  submitted by any other investigating agency stating that the case is not made out on account of lack of evidence or for any other reason.

5. But before we proceed to deal with the question involved herein, it is essential to state the salient facts and circumstances of this matter which has reached upto this Court by way of this special leave petition. On perusal of the materials on record, it emerges that the appellant - Smt. Vasanti Dubey was posted as the Block Development Officer, Janpad Panchayat, Gotegon, Narsinghpur (M.P.) and in that capacity was competent to award a contract for constructing concrete road in the village Baroda. The contract was awarded to one Dinesh Kumar Patel who was the Sarpanch of village Baroda for constructing the concrete road in the village and was initially paid a sum of Rs.15,000/- vide cheque No. 101626 dated 27.2.2001 for execution of the contract. He was further paid a sum of Rs.15,000/- vide cheque No.101629 dated 8.5.2001 for execution of the contract which was awarded to him. The awardee Sarpanch - Dinesh Kumar Patel was still further paid Rs.10,000/- vide cheque No.101635 dated 23.5.2001 and the balance payment of Rs. 10,000/-

was also finally paid to him vide cheque No.319586 dated 1.8.2001 towards full and final settlement of the consideration for the above mentioned contract. Admittedly, all the afore-

mentioned payments were made to the Sarpanch contractor -

Dinesh Kumar Patel which were due to be paid to him and the cheques were duly encashed.

6. However, the Sarpanch/contractor after several days of receipt of the final payment, filed a complaint against the appellant/BDO - Smt. Vasanti Dubey in the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, Jabalpur stating inter-alia that the complainant - Dinesh Kumar Patel had been paid a sum of Rs.40,000/- only with respect to the contract awarded to him and when the balance payment of Rs.10,000/- was demanded by him, the appellant demanded a sum of Rs.3,000/- as commission. The complainant's further case is that he although paid a sum of Rs.500/-, he felt aggrieved and hence did not pay any further amount to the appellant but preferred to lodge a complaint on 7.8.2001 in regard to the illegal demand made by her. Since the alleged incident was falling within the jurisdiction of the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, Bhopal, a case was  registered against the appellant on the basis of the complaint on the same date i.e. 7.8.2001 under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(1)(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

7. The Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, proceeded to investigate the matter and carried out detailed investigation and also recorded statements of various persons including that of the complainant on 26.3.2002. In course of investigation, the complainant resiled from his earlier version and stated that he had made a false complaint at the instance of someone else whose name he did not divulge. Further statement of one Shankar Singh was also recorded that the complainant had paid Rs.2,500/- to the appellant when she had gone to the bathroom and the money thereafter was recovered from her. The police also seized various documents from the office of the BDO located in the office of Janpad Gotegaon which included the files containing the details of the cheques from which payment had been made to the complainant. After completion of the investigation by the Office of Lokayukta who was competent to get the matter investigated by the police and in view of the statement of the  complainant that he made false complaint at the instance of someone else as also on account of the fact that the entire payment except Rs. 10,000/- had been made by the appellant

- Smt. Vasanti Dubey to the complainant prior to the date on which the complaint was filed, it was inferred that the complaint did not disclose commission of any offence and hence the Lokayukta directed that a closure report be filed in regard to the complaint lodged against Vasanti Dubey and appropriate action be initiated against the complainant for lodging a false complaint.

8. Accordingly, the closure report was submitted before the Special Judge, Narsinghpur but by order dated 5.8.2002, the Special Judge refused to accept the same. He thus rejected the closure report and thereafter directed the police to file charge-sheet in the case against the appellant against which the State Government filed a criminal revision bearing Criminal Revision No. 1206/2002 in the High Court challenging the order of the Special Judge who refused to accept the closure report and issued direction for submission of the charge-sheet against the appellant.

9. The learned single Judge of the High Court by order dated 14.1.2003 was pleased to allow the Revision Petition and quashed the order passed by the Special Judge who had refused to accept the closure report and had directed submission of charge-sheet against the appellant on the ground that there is no power expressly or impliedly conferred under the Code on a magistrate to call upon the police to submit a charge-sheet when police had sent a report under Section 169 of the Code stating that there is no case made out for sending up an accused for a trial. The learned single Judge took this view relying upon the ratio of the authoritative pronouncement of this Court delivered in the matter of Abhinandan Jha & Ors. Vs. Dinesh Mishra1 wherein it was observed that the functions of the magistrate and the police are entirely different and though the magistrate may or may not accept the report and take action according to law, he cannot impinge upon the jurisdiction of the police by compelling them to change their opinion so as to accord with his view. The learned Judge also took notice of the observation of the Supreme Court which had further been pleased to hold therein that the magistrate however, while 1 AIR 1968 SC 117 = (1967) 3 SCR 668  disagreeing with a final report/closure report of a case can take cognizance under Section 190(1)(c) or order further investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure but cannot straightaway direct for submission of charge-sheet to the police. Applying the aforesaid test as laid down by this Court in the case of Abhinandan Jha (supra), the impugned order passed by the Special Judge, Narsinghpur was held to be illegal and without jurisdiction and consequently was quashed. However, the learned single Judge had added an observation in the judgment and order that if the learned Special Judge thinks it fit and appropriate to take cognizance, the same can be taken under Section 190(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure or he may direct the Lokayukta police for further investigation. As already stated the revision accordingly was allowed and the impugned order of the Special Judge dated 5.8.2002 was quashed.

10. The Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, Jabalpur, thereafter again got the complaint examined in the light of the statement of the witnesses and the evidence and noticed that there were no materials against the appellant to proceed as she had made all payments from 27.2.2001 up to  2.8.2001 yet a complaint dated 7.8.2001 was subsequently filed by the complainant - Dinesh Kumar Patel alleging that the appellant had demanded commission/bribe of Rs.2,500/-

from the complainant in order to clear his bills which complaint was found to be untrustworthy and hence unacceptable since all payments had already been received by the complainant prior to the lodgement of complaint specially in view of the subsequent version of the complainant that he had lodged a malicious complaint at the instance of a rival of the appellant.

11. The Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, therefore, once again filed an application/closure report before the Special Judge, Narsinghpur but the Special Judge, Narsinghpur this time again rejected the closure report by order dated 18.5.2004 observing therein that it had been clarified by order dated 5.8.2002 that there is sufficient basis to take cognizance against the appellant - Smt. Vasanti Dubey and there is no change in the circumstance on the basis of which closure report can be accepted clearly overlooking that the High Court had already quashed the order dated 5.8.2002 passed by the Special Judge as it had  held that the Special Judge had no jurisdiction to direct the police to submit charge sheet in case he refuses to accept closure report although he could take cognizance under Section 190(C) of the Cr.P.C. or direct further investigation of the case. In pursuance of this, further investigation was done by the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office and closure report was submitted after completion of reinvestigation. On this occasion, when the Special Judge refused to accept closure report, it was his statutory and legal duty to either pass a fresh order taking cognizance if he refused to dismiss the complaint and proceed with the enquiry under Section 200 Cr.P.C. by examining the complainant after which he had to record reasons why he disagreed with the closure report. But the Special Judge did not discharge this legal obligation and simply in a mechanical manner directed the investigating agency to obtain sanction to prosecute the appellant despite the fact that the investigating agency had consistently reported that sufficient evidence was not there to justify prosecution of the appellant.

At this stage, if the Special Judge found that there were sufficient ground to proceed, it could have taken cognizance  but having been confronted with the legal impediment that it could not proceed without sanction for prosecution, the Special Judge directed to reinvestigate the matter once again for the second time and also directed the investigating agency to obtain sanction for prosecution.

12. Hence, the appellant assailed the order of the Special Judge dated 18.5.2004 by filing a criminal revision petition No. 839/2004 but the High Court on this occasion dismissed the revision petition and was pleased to hold that the order of the Special Judge who had refused to accept the closure report for the second time did not suffer from any apparent error of jurisdiction. The learned single Judge while dismissing the revision petition observed that it shall still be open to the appellant to raise all such pleas as are available to her under the law in case charge-sheet is filed against her.

13. However, the learned single Judge completely missed the ratio laid down in the case of Abhinandan Jha (supra) which had been relied upon by the learned single Judge of the High Court on an earlier occasion also when the order of the Special Judge refusing to accept closure report  and directing submission of charge-sheet was quashed and the entire legal position was summed up in unequivocal terms as follows:-

""There is no power, expressly or impliedly conferred under the Code, on a Magistrate to call upon the police to submit a charge- sheet, when they have sent a report under Section 169 of the Code, that there is no case made out for sending up an accused for trial. The functions of the magistrate and the police are entirely different, and though, the Magistrate may or may not accept the report, and take suitable action according to law, he cannot impinge upon the jurisdiction of the police, by compelling them to change their opinion so as to accord with his view.""
This position has been further reiterated and reinforced in a recent judgment of this Court delivered in the matter of Ram Naresh Prasad vs. State of Jharkhand2, wherein it has been held that when the police submitted a final report of investigation of the case which in colloquial term is called closure report, the magistrate cannot direct the police to submit the charge-sheet. However, on the basis of the material in the charge-sheet, he may take cognizance or direct further investigation. In fact, this position is clearly laid down 2 (2009) 11 SCC 299  under Section 190 read with Section 156 of the Cr.P.C. itself and the legal position has been time and again clarified by this Court in several pronouncements viz. in the matter of Bains vs. State3, wherein their lordships have summarised the position as follows:-

""1. When a Magistrate receives a complaint, he may, instead of taking cognizance at once under Section 190(1)(a) direct a police investigation under Section 156(3) ante;
2. Where, after completion of the investigation, the police sends an adverse report under Section 173(1), the Magistrate may take any of the following steps :
""i. If he agrees with police report, and finds that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding further, he may drop the proceeding and dismiss the complaint.
ii. He may not agree with the police report and may take cognizance of the offence on the basis of the original complaint, under Section 190(1)(a) and proceed to examine the complainant under Section iii. Even if he disagrees with the police report, he may either take cognizance at once upon the complaint, direct an enquiry under Section 202 and after such 3 AIR 1980 SC 1883 = 1980 (4) SCC 631  enquiry take action under Section
203. However, when the police submits a final report or closure report in regard to a case which has been lodged by the informant or complainant, the magistrate cannot direct the police to straightway submit the charge- sheet as was the view expressed in the matter of Abhinandan Jha (supra) which was relied upon in the matter of Ram Naresh Prasad (supra).""
14. Thus it is undoubtedly true that even after the police report indicates that no case is made out against the accused, the magistrate can ignore the same and can take cognizance on applying his mind independently to the case.

But in that situation, he has two options (i) he may not agree with the police report and direct an enquiry under Section 202 and after such enquiry take action under Section

203. He is also entitled to take cognizance under Section 190 Cr.P.C. at once if he disagrees with the adverse police report but even in this circumstance, he cannot straightway direct submission of the charge-sheet by the police.

15. In the light of the aforesaid legal position, when we examined the merit of the instant matter, we noticed that the order dated 18.5.2004 passed earlier by the Special Judge  straightway directing the police to submit charge-sheet was quashed by the learned single Judge of the High Court and liberty was left open to him either to take cognizance under Section 190(c) of the Cr.P.C. or direct the Lokayukta Police for further investigation. In spite of this order, the Special Judge did not pass an order taking cognizance which he could have done under Section 190(c) of the Cr.P.C. However, he chose to direct office of the Lokayukta to enter into further investigation which after further investigation assigned reasons given out hereinbefore, stating that in view of the statement of the complainant that he had complained at the instance of a rival of the accused as also the fact that entire payment had already been made by the complainant prior to the lodgement of complaint, no case was made out against the complainant. In spite of this, if the Special Judge considered it legal and appropriate to proceed in the matter, he could have taken cognizance upon the complaint and could have proceeded further as per the provision under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. by examining the complainant and if there were sufficient ground for proceeding, he could have issued process for attendance of the accused. However, such process could  not have been issued, unless the magistrate found that the evidence led before him was contradictory or completely untrustworthy. Conversely, if he found from such evidence that sufficient ground was not there for proceeding i.e. no prima facie case against the accused was made out, he had to dismiss the complaint, since the complaint did not disclose the commission of any offence. But instead of taking any step either by issuing the process or dismissing the complaint at once, he could have taken immediate step as a third alternative to make an enquiry into the truth or falsehood of the complaint or for an investigation to be made by the police for ascertaining whether there was any prima facie evidence so as to justify the issue of process. In short, on receipt of a complaint, the magistrate is not bound to take cognizance but he can without taking cognizance direct investigation by the police under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. Once, however, he takes cognizance he must examine the complainant and his witnesses under Section 200. Thereafter, if he requires police investigation or judicial enquiry, he must proceed under Section 202. But in any case he cannot direct the Police to straightaway file charge-sheet which needs to be highlighted  as this point is often missed by the Magistrates in spite of a series of decisions of this Court including the case of Abhinandan Jha (supra) and Ram Naresh Prasad (supra) referred to hereinbefore.

16. When the facts of the instant matter is further tested on the anvil of the aforesaid legal position, we find that the Special Judge instead of following the procedure enumerated in the Cr.P.C. appeared to insist on rejecting the closure report given by the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office and in the process consistently committed error of law and jurisdiction not only once, but twice. On the first occasion when the order of the Special Judge was quashed and set aside by the High Court granting liberty to the Special Judge either to take cognizance under Section 190(c) or order for further investigation as he had committed an error of jurisdiction by directing the police to straightway submit the charge-sheet against the accused-petitioner, the Special Judge did not consider it appropriate to take cognizance but ordered for further investigation by Lokayukta Police and when the matter was reinvestigated by the Special Police Establishment of the Lokayukta Office, the Special  Judge in spite of the finding of the investigating agency holding that no further material to proceed in the matter was found, refused to accept the closure report and this time it further realized that it could not proceed in the matter as there was no sanction for prosecution, which the Special Judge obviously noticed since he was not in a position to take cognizance directly under Sections 7, 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act in absence of sanction which was a statutory requirement. In spite of this, he refused to accept closure report but recorded a direction to obtain sanction for prosecution of the appellant and thereafter ordered for reinvestigation of the complaint for the second time creating a peculiar and anomalous situation which is not in consonance with the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure enumerated under the Chapter relating to conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings.

17. It may be worthwhile to highlight at this stage that the enquiry under Section 200 Cr.P.C. cannot be given a go-

bye if the Magistrate refuses to accept the closure report submitted by the investigating agency as this enquiry is legally vital to protect the affected party from a frivolous complaint  and a vexatious prosecution in complaint cases. The relevance, legal efficacy and vitality of the enquiry enumerated under Section 200 Cr.P.C., therefore, cannot be undermined, ignored or underplayed as non compliance of enquiry under Section 200 Cr.P.C. is of vital importance and necessity as it is at this stage of the enquiry that the conflict between the finding arrived at by the investigating agency and enquiry by the Magistrate can prima facie justify the filing of the complaint and also offer a plank and a stage where the justification of the order of cognizance will come to the fore.

This process of enquiry under Section 200 Cr.P.C. is surely not a decorative piece of legislation but is of great relevance and value to the complainant as well as the accused.

18. It is no doubt possible to contend that at the stage of taking cognizance or refusing to take cognizance, only prima facie case has to be seen by the Court. But the argument would be fit for rejection since it is nothing but mixing up two different and distinct nature of cases as the principle and procedure applied in a case based on Police report which is registered on the basis of First Information Report cannot be allowed to follow the procedure in a complaint case. A case  based on a complaint cannot be allowed to be dealt with and proceeded as if it were a case based on Police report. While in a case based on Police report, the Court while taking cognizance will straightaway examine whether a prima facie case is made out or not and will not enter into the correctness of the allegation levelled in the F.I.R., a complaint case requires an enquiry by the Magistrate under Section 200 Cr.P.C. if he takes cognizance of the complaint. In case he refuses to take cognizance he may either dismiss the complaint or direct the investigating agency to enter into further investigation. In case, he does not exercise either of these two options, he will have to proceed with the enquiry himself as envisaged and enumerated under Section 200 Cr.P.C. But, he cannot exercise the fourth option of directing the Police to submit a charge-sheet as such a course is clearly not envisaged under the Cr.P.C. and more so in a complaint case. As already stated, this position can be clearly deduced from the catena of decisions including those referred to hereinbefore but needs to be reinstated as time and again this magisterial error reaches up to this Court for rectification by judicial intervention.

19. The instant matter is one such example and is one step ahead wherein the Special Judge was confronted with yet another legal impediment of lack of sanction for prosecution giving rise to a peculiar situation when he noticed and recorded that he could not proceed in the matter under the Prevention of Corruption Act without sanction for prosecution, but in spite of this he directed to obtain sanction, ordered for reinvestigation and consequently refused to accept closure report.

20. Since the Special Judge in the instant matter refused to accept the closure report dated 18.05.2004 without any enquiry or reason why he refused to accept it which was submitted by the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, Jabalpur after reinvestigation for which reasons had been assigned and there was also lack of sanction for prosecution against the appellant which was necessary for launching prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act, we deem it just and appropriate to hold that the Special Judge clearly committed error of jurisdiction by directing reinvestigation of the matter practically for the third time in spite of his noticing that sanction for prosecution was also  lacking, apart from the fact that the Special Police Establishment, Lokayukta Office, after reinvestigation had given its report why the matter was not fit to be proceeded with.

21. We are therefore of the considered view that the Special Judge in the wake of all these legal flaws as also the fact that the Special Judge under the circumstance was not competent to proceed in the matter without sanction for prosecution, could not have ordered for reinvestigation of the case for the third time by refusing to accept closure report dated 18.05.2004. This amounts to sheer abuse of the process of law resulting into vexatious proceeding and harassment of the appellant for more than 10 years without discussing any reason why he disagreed with the report of the Lokayukta and consequently the closure report which would have emerged if the Special Judge had carefully proceeded in accordance with the procedure enumerated for initiation of proceeding under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

22. In view of the aforesaid discussion based on the existing facts and circumstances, we deem it just and appropriate to set aside the impugned order passed by the  Special Judge refusing to accept the closure report dated 18.05.2004 and consequently the judgment and order of the High Court by which the order of the Special Judge was upheld, also stands quashed and set aside. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.",1,
ASSAM URBAN WATER SUPPLY & SEW. BOARD,"Two contracts were entered into between the appellants and the respondents - (i) for construction of Tezpur Town Water Supply Scheme and (ii) for construction of Tinsukia Town Water Supply Scheme. Certain disputes arose between the parties concerning these contracts and to resolve such disputes, sole arbitrator was appointed by the Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court on March 26, 2002 under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, '1996 Act'). On May 10, 2002 the appellants filed application under Section 16 of the 1996 Act questioning the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator as according to the appellants there was no arbitration clause in the agreement. This application came to be rejected by the sole arbitrator.

 CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006
2. Thereafter, the sole arbitrator proceeded with the arbitration and passed two awards in relation to the above contracts in favour of the respondents on August 22, 2003. The awards were received by the appellants on August 26, 2003. On January 2, 2004, the appellants made two applications for setting aside the awards dated August 22, 2003 under Section 34 of the 1996 Act. These applications were accompanied by two separate applications for extension of time under Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.

3. The District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, dismissed the appellants' applications under Section 34 of the 1996 Act on June 1, 2004 and June 5, 2004 on the ground of limitation.

4 The appellants challenged the above orders of the Districted Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, in the Gauhati High Court in two separate Arbitration Appeals, being Arbitration Appeal Nos. 6 of 2004 and 7 of 2004. The Division Bench of that Court upheld the view of the District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati and dismissed the above Arbitration Appeals.

5. Mr. Bijender Singh, learned counsel for the appellants, submitted that the Division Bench gravely erred in applying the decision of this Court in Union of India  CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006 Vs. Popular Construction Co.1 to the facts of the present case. He submitted that the judgment of this Court in Popular Construction Co. (supra) was rendered on the question of applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (for short, '1963 Act') and has no application to the peculiar facts of the present case where extension was sought by the appellants under Section 4 of the 1963 Act. In support of his argument, Mr. Bijender Singh, learned counsel, referred to Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act that defines 'period of limitation' and Section 43 of the 1996 Act that makes the 1963 Act applicable to arbitration matters.

6. Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that the High Court did not commit any error in upholding the view of the District Judge, Kamarup, Guwahati. According to the learned senior counsel, the High Court's view is consistent with Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, particularly proviso (3) thereof.

7. Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act provides that an application for setting aside an award may be made within three months of the receipt of the arbitral award. The proviso that follows sub-section (3) of Section 34 provides that on sufficient cause being shown, the court may 1 (2001) 8 SCC 470  CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006 entertain the application for setting aside the award after the period of three months and within a further period of 30 days but not thereafter.

8. In Popular Construction Co. (supra), this Court has held that an application for setting aside an award filed beyond the period mentioned in Section 34(3) would not be an application ""in accordance with sub-section (3) as required under Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act"" and Section 5 of the 1963 Act has no application to such application. In para 12 of the report, it was held in Popular Construction Co. (supra) thus:-

""12. As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are ""but not thereafter"" used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of the Act. Parliament did not need to go further. To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase ""but not thereafter"" wholly otiose. No principle of interpretation would justify such a result"".
9. Recently, in the State of Maharashtra Vs. Hindustan Construction Company Limited2, a two Judge Bench of this Court speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) 2 (2010) 4 SCC 518  CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006 emphasised the mandatory nature of the limit to the extension of the period provided in proviso to Section 34(3) and held that an application for setting aside arbitral award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act has to be made within the time prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 34, i.e., within three months and a further period of 30 days on sufficient cause being shown and not thereafter.

10. Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that the 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court. The 1963 Act is thus applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of the express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.

11. The facts in the present case are peculiar. The arbitral awards were received by the appellants on August 26, 2003. No application for setting aside the arbitral awards was made by the appellants before elapse of three months from the receipt thereof. As a matter of fact, three months from the date of the receipt of the arbitral award by the appellants expired on November 26, 2003. The District Court had Christmas vacation for the period from December 25, 2003 to January 1, 2004. On reopening of the court, i.e., on January 2, 2004, admittedly, the appellants made applications for setting aside those awards under Section 34  CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006 of the 1996 Act. If the period during which the District Court, Kamrup, Guwahati, remained closed during Christmas vacation, 2003 is extended and the appellants get benefit of that period over and above the cap of thirty days as provided in Section 34(3), then the view of the High Court and the District Judge cannot be sustained. But this would depend on the applicability of Section 4 of the 1963 Act. The question, therefore, that falls for our determination is

- whether the appellants are entitled to extension of time under Section 4 of the 1963 Act in the above facts.

12. Section 4 of the 1963 Act reads as under :-

""4. Expiry of prescribed period when court is closed.-Where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on a day when the court is closed, the suit, appeal or application may be instituted, preferred or made on the day when the court reopens.
Explanation.-A court shall be deemed to be closed on any day within the meaning of this section if during any part of its normal working hours it remains closed on that day.""
13. The above Section enables a party to institute a suit, prefer an appeal or make an application on the day court reopens where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on the day when the court is closed. The crucial words in Section 4 of the 1963 Act are 'prescribed period'. What is the meaning of these words?  CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006 Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act defines 'period of limitation' which means the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the Schedule, and 'prescribed period' means the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act when read in the context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, it becomes amply clear that the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside arbitral award is three months. The period of 30 days mentioned in proviso that follows sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is not the 'period of limitation' and, therefore, not 'prescribed period' for the purposes of making the application for setting aside the arbitral award. The period of 30 days beyond three months which the court may extend on sufficient cause being shown under the proviso appended to sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act being not the 'period of limitation' or, in other words, 'prescribed period', in our opinion, Section 4 of the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to the facts of the present case.

14. Seen thus, the applications made by the appellants on January 2, 2004, for setting aside the arbitral award dated August 26, 2003 were liable to be dismissed and have rightly been dismissed by the District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, as time barred.

 CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 2014 OF 2006
15. The dismissal of the Arbitration Appeals (6 of 2004 and 7 of 2004) by the High Court, thus, cannot be legally flawed for the reasons we have indicated above.

16. The Appeal has no force and is dismissed with no order as to costs.",0,
RUSHIKESH TANAJI BHOITE,"1. Leave granted.

2. We have heard Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellant, Mr. Shankar Chillarge, learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra and Mr. Suhas Kadam, learned counsel for the respondent no. 4.

3. On January 10, 2011, the District Magistrate, Jalgaon in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981 (for short 'the 1981 Act') and the Government Order Home Department (Special) Mantralaya, Mumbai No. DDS 1210/Cr-207/SPL-3(B) dated 31.12.2010  directed Tanaji Keshavrao Bhoite resident of Kishavkunj, Bhoite Nagar, Jalgaon to be detained under the provisions of the 1981 Act. This order was followed by another order of the same date directing that Tanaji Keshavrao Bhoite shall be detained in Central Prison, Nagpur.

4. The legality of the detention order dated January 10, 2011 was challenged by the present appellant, who is son of the detenu, in the Bombay High Court at Aurangabad Bench, Aurangabad. The Division Bench of that Court dismissed the Criminal Writ Petition filed by the appellant on May 13, 2011. It is from this order that the present appeal, by special leave, has arisen.

5. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellant urged diverse grounds in challenging the order of the High Court. We do not want to deal with all the grounds urged by Dr. A.M. Singhvi as in our view, appeal deserves to be allowed on the short ground that we indicate hereinafter.

6. In pursuance of Section 8 of 1981 Act, the detenu was supplied with the grounds for detention setting out therein particulars of offences and the action taken against him. The offences registered against the detenu way back in the year 1980 upto the last offence registered on August 14, 2010 have been noted by the detaining authority in reaching at the satisfaction that the detenu's activities were  prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and he was dangerous person within the meaning of Section 2 (b-1) of the 1981 Act. The last criminal case referred to in the grounds is against the detenu for the offences under Sections 143, 147, 323, 504, 506, 353, 427 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act read with Section 37 (1)(3) for breach of Section 135 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, registered at Dharangaon Police Station on August 14, 2010.

7. The admitted position is that detenu was arrested in connection with the above crime on August 15, 2010 and he was released on bail by the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dharangaon on that very day. One of the conditions imposed in the Order of Bail was that the detenu would appear at Dharangaon Police Station on every Monday between 10.00 a.m. to 12 O'Clock till the charge-sheet was filed. Later on, the detenu made an application before the Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dharangaon seeking relaxation of the above condition. That application was allowed and the above condition was relaxed by the concerned Judicial Magistrate on January 4, 2011.

8. It would be, thus, seen that the order releasing the detenu on bail in the crime registered on August 14, 2010 and the order relaxing the bail condition were passed by the  Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Dharangaon much before the issuance of detention order dated January 10, 2011. However, the detention order or the grounds supplied to the detenu do not show that the detaining authority was aware of the bail order granted in favour of the dentenu on August 15, 2010.

9. In a case where detenu is released on bail and is enjoying his freedom under the order of the court at the time of passing the order of detention, then such order of bail, in our opinion, must be placed before the detaining authority to enable him to reach at the proper satisfaction.

10. In the present case, since the order of bail dated August 15, 2010 was neither placed before the detaining authority at the time of passing the order of detention nor the detaining authority was aware of the order of bail, in our view, the detention order is rendered invalid. We cannot attempt to assess in what manner and to what extent consideration of the order granting bail to the detenu would have effected the satisfaction of the detaining authority but suffice it to say that non-placing and non-consideration of the material as vital as the bail order has vitiated the subjective decision of the detaining authority.

11. A three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Rekha vs. State of Tamil Nadu Through Secretary to Government and  Another, reported in (2011) 5 SCC 244, decided recently held as under:

""In this connection,it may be noted that there is nothing on the record to indicate whether the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the bail application of the accused was pending on the date when the detention order was passed on 08.04.2010. On the other hand, in para 4 of the grounds of detention it is mentioned that ""Thiru. Ramakrishnan is in remand in crime No. 132/2010 and he has not moved any bail application so far"". Thus, the detaining authority was not even aware whether a bail application of the accused was pending when he passed the detention order, rather the detaining authority passed the detention order under the impression that no bail application of the accused was pending but in similar cases bail had been granted by the courts. We have already stated above that no details of the alleged similar cases has been given. Hence, the detention order in question cannot be sustained.""
12. In the case of Rekha (supra), the detention order was held to be bad as the detaining authority was not aware of the fact that the bail application of the detenu was pending on the date when the detention order was passed. In the present case, the detenu was already released on bail but the detaining authority was not aware of the fact of grant of bail to the detenu.

13. A reference to the decision of the majority view in the case of Vijay Narain Singh vs. State of Bihar and Others, reported in (1984) 3 SCC 14, may not be out of the context. In paragraph 32 of the Judgment, Venkataramiah,  J. (as His Lordship then was) speaking for the majority observed as follows:

""When a person is enlarged on bail by a competent criminal court, great caution should be exercised in scrutinising the validity of an order of preventive detention which is based on the very same charge which is to be tried by the criminal court.""
14. The other offences referred to in the order of detention suffer from remoteness and want of proximity to the order of detention. None of the criminal cases, except the offence registered on August 14, 2010, referred to in the grounds for detention, can be said to be proximate to the order of detention.

15. In view of the above, we are satisfied that the order of detention dated January 10, 2011 cannot be sustained and has to be set aside. We order accordingly.

16. Appeal is allowed and the order dated May 13, 2011 passed by the Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench, Aurangabad, is set aside. The detenu - Tanaji Keshavrao Bhoite - is ordered to be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

17. In light of the above order, no order is required to be passed on the Application for Impleadment and the same stands disposed of accordingly.

1)        Leave granted.



2)        This appeal is filed against the final judgment and order 



dated 25.01.2007 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Writ Petition No. 732 (M/B) of 2005 whereby the Division Bench while allowing the petition filed by the respondents herein issued a writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the impugned order dated  27.09.2004 passed by the Additional Collector (Finance & Revenue), Lucknow and the demand notice dated 20.01.2005.

3)    Brief Facts:



a)    A Sale Deed dated 16.04.2003 was executed between Har 



Charan Singh and the respondents herein in respect of the property situated at 17/1 Ashok Marg, Lucknow measuring 11,029 sq. ft. and registered as Sale Deed Document No. 5341 of 2003. The total value of the property was computed as Rs.

1,55,28,860/- for the purposes of Stamp Duty and the respondents herein paid Rs. 15,53,000/- as stamp duty.

b) The District Magistrate, Lucknow made a spot inspection of the property in question on 21.07.2003. During inspection, the land has been found having an area of 12,099 sq. ft. with a two storey building having an area of 5,646.3 sq. ft. at ground floor and an area of 5192.3 sq. ft. at the first floor. In the inspection report, the property in question has been valued for Rs. 3,87,74,097/- and the stamp duty on the said property has been calculated by the competent authority as Rs. 38,78,000/-. However, at the time of purchase, respondents herein paid Rs. 15,53,000/- as Stamp duty,  hence a deficiency of Rs. 23,50,000/- has been pointed out by the authorities. The District Magistrate, vide report dated 26.07.2003, directed to register a case against the respondents herein

c) On the basis of the aforesaid report, Case No. 653 Stamp-2003 under Sections 47A/33 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 (in short `the Act') was registered. Vide order dated 27.09.2004, the Additional Collector (Finance & Revenue) Lucknow directed the respondents to make good the deficiency in the stamp duty and also imposed a penalty amounting to Rs. 8,46,000/- for such tax evasion. On 20.01.2005, for failure to deposit the aforesaid amount, a demand notice claiming an amount of Rs. 38,30,500/- plus 10% recovery charges was issued and the respondents herein were directed to pay the said amount within a period of seven days.

d) Being aggrieved by the order dated 27.09.2004 and demand notice dated 20.01.2005, the respondent filed a writ petition being No. 732 of 2005 before the High Court. By order dated 25.01.2007, the High Court, while allowing the petition filed by the respondents herein issued a writ in the nature of  certiorari quashing the impugned order dated 27.09.2004 passed by the Additional Collector (Finance & Revenue), Lucknow and the demand notice dated 20.01.2005.

e) Aggrieved by the said decision, the State has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this Court.

4) Heard Mr. Shail Kumar Dwivedi, learned Addl. Advocate General for the appellant-State and Mr. K.V. Viswanathan, learned senior counsel for the respondents.

5) The only question for consideration in this appeal is whether the High Court is justified in interfering with the order dated 27.09.2004 passed by the Additional Collector (Finance and Revenue), Lucknow demanding differential stamp duty with interest and penalty in respect of the sale deed dated 16.04.2003 executed in favour of the respondents herein. According to the respondents, through a registered Sale Deed dated 16.04.2003 they have purchased the house No. 17/1 Ashok Marg, Lucknow for a total sale consideration of Rs.1.5 crores on which required stamp duty of Rs. 15.53 lakhs was paid. When the Additional Collector issued a notice under Section 47A/33 of the Act, the respondents submitted  objection dated 29.08.2003 stating that the extent, area and valuation are in accordance with the revenue records and the stamp duty paid by them on the sale deed was proper. It is also stated by the respondents that before passing the order dated 27.09.2004, the Additional Collector (Finance and Revenue) Lucknow has not afforded sufficient opportunity to them and the impugned order was passed in a most arbitrary manner ignoring the objection submitted by them. It is also stated that at the time of sale deed the house was a residential property and in order to avoid unnecessary harassment at the hands of the revenue and for the purpose of stamp duty and registration they had valued the said property at the rate fixed by the Collector, Lucknow treating the land as commercial at the rate of Rs.11,300 per sq. metre. In other words, for the purpose of stamp duty and registration, according to the respondents, they added additional 10% to the value.

6) In support of the contention that they were not given adequate opportunity by the Addl. Collector and order was passed on a public holiday, before the High Court as well as in this Court, the respondents herein have placed the order sheet  which contains the various dates and the date on which the ultimate decision was taken by him. It shows that the matter was heard and decided on a public holiday. In all fairness, the High Court instead of keeping the writ petition pending and deciding itself after two years could have remitted the matter to the Addl. Collector for fresh orders. However, it had gone into the details as to the area of the plot, nature of the building i.e. whether it is residential or non-residential and based on the revenue records and after finding that at the time of execution of the sale deed, the house was used for residential purpose upheld the stand taken by the respondents and set aside the order dated 27.09.2004 passed by the Addl. Collector.

7) Learned counsel appearing for the appellant-State submitted that as per the provisions of the Act and the Rules made therein, there is a provision for appeal and instead of resorting the same, the respondents have straightaway approached the High Court by exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 226 which is not permissible. A perusal of the proceedings before the High Court show that the State was not  serious in raising this objection relating to alternative remedy and allowed the High Court to pass orders on merits, hence we are not entertaining such objection at this juncture though it is relevant. In fact, on receipt of the notice from the High Court in 2005, the appellants who are respondents before the High Court could have objected the writ petition filed under Article 226 and sought for dismissal of the same for not availing alternative remedy but the fact remains that unfortunately the State or its officers have not resorted to such recourse.

8) We have already held that it is the grievance of the respondents that the orders were passed by the Additional Collector on a public holiday. Regarding the merits though the Collector, Lucknow made a surprise site inspection, there is no record to show that all the details such as measurement, extent, boundaries were noted in the presence of the respondents who purchased the property. It is also explained that the plot in question is not a corner plot as stated in the impugned order as boundaries of the plot mentioned in the freehold deed executed by Nazool Officer and in the sale deed  dated 16.04.2003 only on one side there is a road. It is also demonstrated that at the time of execution of the sale deed, the house in question was used for residential purpose and it is asserted that the stamp duty was paid based on the position and user of the building on the date of the purchase. The impugned order of the High Court shows that it was not seriously disputed about the nature and user of the building, namely, residential purpose on the date of the purchase.

Merely because the property is being used for commercial purpose at the later point of time may not be a relevant criterion for assessing the value for the purpose of stamp duty.

The nature of user is relatable to the date of purchase and it is relevant for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty. Though the matter could have been considered by the Appellate Authority in view of our reasoning that there was no serious objection and in fact the said alternative remedy was not agitated seriously and in view of the factual details based on which the High Court has quashed the order dated 27.09.2004 passed by the Additional District Collector, we are not inclined to interfere at this juncture.

9) Under these circumstances, we find no valid ground for interference with the impugned order of the High Court.

Consequently, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.",0,

CIVIL APPEAL NOs. 4530-4532 OF 2005:

These are appeals under Section 35L (b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 against the order dated 15.03.2005 of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, West Zonal Bench, Mumbai, (for short ""the Tribunal"").

2. The facts very briefly are that the appellant produces inter alia Reduced Crude Oil (for short ""RCO""). By Notification No. 75/84-CE dated 01.03.1984, the Central government in exercise of its powers under Sub-Rule 1 of Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 (for short ""the Rules"") exempted goods described in Column 3 of the table annexed to the notification from so much of the duty of excise as is specified in the notification subject to the intended use, or the conditions, if any, laid down in Column 5 of the table annexed to the notification. One of the goods exempted from excise duty by the notification was RCO, if produced only from indigenous crude oil subject to intended use as fuel for generation of electrical energy by electricity undertakings owned or controlled by the Central Government or any State Government or any State Electricity Board or any local authority or any licensee under Part-II of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 except those who produce electrical energy not for sale but for their own consumption or for supply to their own undertakings. The proviso in the notification stated two conditions subject to which the exemption was granted and one of the conditions  was that where the intended use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Rules is followed. Rule 192 in Chapter X of the Rules provided inter alia that where the Central Government has by notification under Rule 8 sanctioned the remission of duty on excisable goods other than salt used in a specified industrial process and it is necessary for this purpose to obtain an excise registration certificate, he should submit the requisite application along with the proof of payment of the registration fee and shall then be granted a registration certificate in the proper form. Rule 192 further provided that the concession shall, unless renewed by the Collector, cease on the expiry of the registration certificate.

3. The Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. had obtained a registration certificate in Form CT-2 under Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules and on the strength of such registration certificate, purchased RCO from the appellant availing the exemption from excise duty under Notification No. 75/84 dated 01.03.1984 (for short `the exemption notification'). The registration certificate obtained by the  Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. expired on 31.12.1995 and a fresh registration was granted in its favour on 26.06.1996. After issuing two show-cause notices, the Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise passed two orders demanding excise duty of Rs. 32,35,485/- from the appellant for RCO supplied to the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. during the period 01.01.1996 to 25.06.1996 on the ground that the said company did not have a registration certificate in Form CT-2 under Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules during this period and, therefore, the RCO supplied by the appellant to the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. during this period was not exempt from excise duty. The appellant paid the excise duty and subsequently applied for refund contending that the registration certificate in Form CT-2 had been obtained by the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. on 26.06.1996.

The refund claims were rejected by the Assistant Commissioner. Thereafter, the appellant filed appeals before the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) who confirmed the demands of excise duty for the period from 01.01.1996 to 25.06.1996. The appellant then filed three  appeals before the Tribunal against the orders of Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) confirming demand and the order rejecting the refund claim. By the impugned order, the Tribunal dismissed the appeals saying that as the statutory requirement of conditional exemption notification had not been complied with by the appellant it was not entitled to the exemption benefit.

4. Mr. Alok Yadav, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the Tribunal failed to appreciate that the RCO supplied by the appellant to Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. was in fact used as fuel for generation of electrical energy and therefore the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the exemption of excise duty under the exemption notification. He cited the decision of this Court in M/s Chunni Lal Parshadi Lal v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P., Lucknow [(1986) 2 SCC 501] wherein it was held that a dealer can prove by any way other than the way contemplated by Rule 12A of the U.P. Sales Tax Rules, 1948 that the goods purchased from him were for resale.

According to Mr. Yadav, the registration certificate in Form  CT-2 is not the only way to prove that the goods sold by the appellant to the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. were used as fuel for generation of electricity. He also relied on Commissioner of Customs (Imports), Mumbai v. Tullow India Operations Ltd. [(2005) (189) ELT 401 (SC)[ wherein this Court held that ONGC being a government company would get the requisite exemption, subject, of course, to its fulfilling the condition of obtaining the essentiality certificate. He argued that the appellant being a government company should not be denied the exemption on a technical ground that there was no registration certificate during the period 01.01.1996 to 25.06.1996.

5. Mr. Anup Chaudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the exemption notification stipulated in the proviso the conditions under which the exemption from excise duty would be available and if the conditions were not fulfilled, the exemption would not be available to the manufacturer.

He submitted that one of the conditions was that where the goods were to be used in a place other than in the factory of  production, the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Rules is to be followed. He submitted that the procedure laid down in Rules 192 to 196 BB in Chapter X of the Rules, therefore, have to be followed, and if the procedure is not followed in any case, the exemption cannot be granted under the exemption notification. He submitted that since under Rule 192, the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd.

was required to obtain a registration certificate in Form CT-

2 and the said company did not obtain a certificate for the period 01.01.1996 to 25.06.1996, RCO supplied by the appellant to the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd.

during this period was exigible to excise duty. He cited the judgement of the Constitution Bench of this court in Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi v. Harichand Shri Gopal [2010 (260) ELT 3 (SC)] in which it has been held that if a party wants remission of duty, he has to follow certain prerequisites, the object of which is to see that the goods are not diverted or utilised for some other purpose under the guise of the exemption notification and, therefore, a plea that the goods were meant for intended use specified in the exemption notification has to be rejected.

6. The question whether it was enough to prove to the satisfaction of the Central Excise Officer that the goods are for the intended use specified in the notification of exemption or whether in addition the procedure laid down in Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules was also to be complied with for availing concession under the exemption notification was raised before this Court in Thermax Private Limited v. The Collector of Customs (Bombay), New Customs House [1992 (61) ELT 352 (SC)] = [(1990) 4 SCC 440] and a two-Judge Bench of this Court held that the possession of a license or production of a C-2 certificate as provided in Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules enables the applicant to secure the necessary concession and that the entitlement to the concession will depend on whether the purchaser is the holder of a L-6 license (or C-2 certificate) or not. These observations made in Thermax Private Limited v. The Collector of Customs (Bombay), New Customs House (supra) were held by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Collector of Customs, Bombay v. J.K. Synthetics Limited [1996 (87) ELT 582 (SC)] = [(1997) 10 SCC 224] as not laying down principle and held to be limited to eligibility for concession  under Rule 192 of the Rules. In the aforesaid decision in the case of Collector of Customs, Bombay v. J.K. Synthetic Limited (supra) this Court took the view that where there was evidence on record that show the intended use of the material, the benefit of exemption could be granted. In a subsequent decision in the case of Collector of Central Excise, Jaipur v. J.K. Synthetics [2000 (120) ELT 54 (SC)] = [(2000) 10 SCC 393] a three-Judge Bench of this Court took the view that if there was substantial compliance of the procedure laid down in Chapter X of the Rules, exemption could be granted. In the case of Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal [2010 (260) ELT 3 (SC)] = [(2011) 1 SCC 236] a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the decisions of this Court in Thermax Private Limited v. The Collector of Customs (Bombay), New Customs House (supra) and Collector of Central Excise, Jaipur v. J.K. Synthetics (supra) and held that a provision for exemption, concession or exception, as the case may be, has to be construed strictly and if the exemption is available only on complying certain conditions, the conditions have to be complied with. In the aforesaid decision, the  Constitution Bench further held that detailed procedures have been laid down in Chapter X of the Rules so as to curb the diversion and utilization of goods which are otherwise excisable and the plea of substantial compliance or intended use therefore has to be rejected.

7. When we strictly construe the exemption notification in this case, we find that the proviso in the exemption notification reads as under:

Provided that where any such exemption is subject to the intended use, the exemption in such case shall be subject to the following conditions namely:-
(i) That it is proved to the satisfaction of an officer not below the rank of the Assistant Collector of Central Excise that such goods are used for the intended use specified in Column (5) of the said Table: and
(ii) Where such use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, is followed.
Thus, the proviso makes it clear that for availing the exemption two conditions must be satisfied: First, that it is proved to the satisfaction of the excise officer that the goods are used for intended use specified in Column (5) of the  Table annexed to the exemption notification and second, where such use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Rules is followed. We cannot, therefore, accept the contention of the learned counsel of the appellant that if the first condition is satisfied, i.e. it is proved to the satisfaction of the Central Excise officer that the goods are used for the intended use, the exemption has to be granted. In our considered opinion, unless the second condition is also satisfied, i.e. the procedure set out in Chapter X of the Rules is followed where the use of the goods is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the exemption cannot be granted under the exemption notification.

8. In the facts of the present case, the RCO was not to be used in the factory of the appellant but at the place of generation of electricity by the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. Hence, the second condition laid down in the proviso was also to be complied with. Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules is quoted hereinbelow:

""RULE 192. Application for concession.--

Where the Central Government has, by notification  under rule 8, or section 5A of the Act, as the case may be, sanctioned the remission of duty on excisable goods other than salt, used in a specified industrial process, any person wishing to obtain remission of duty on such goods, shall make application to the Collector in the proper Form stating the estimated annual quantity of the excisable goods required and the purpose for and the manner in which it is intended to use them and declaring that the goods will be used for such purpose and in such manner. If the Collector is satisfied that the applicant is a person to whom the concession can be granted without danger to the revenue, and if he is satisfied, either by personal inspection or by that of an officer subordinate to him that the premises are suitable and contain a secure store-room suitable for the storage of the goods, and if the applicant agrees to bear the cost of such establishment as the Collector may consider necessary for supervising operation in his premises for the purposes of this Chapter, the Collector may grant the application, and the applicant shall then enter into a bond in the proper Form with such surety or sufficient security, in such amount and under such conditions as the Collector approves. Where, for this purpose, it is necessary for the applicant to obtain an Excise registration certificate, he shall submit the requisite application along with the proof for payment of registration fee and shall then be granted a registration certificate in the proper Form. The concession shall, unless renewed by the Collector, cease on the expiry of the registration certificate:

Provided that, in the event of death, insolvency or insufficiency of the surety, or where the amount of the bond is inadequate, the Collector may, in his discretion, demand a fresh bond; and may, if the  security furnished for a bond is not adequate, demand additional security.""

The language of Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules is clear that for availing concession from excise duty on excisable goods used in a specified industrial process, a person must obtain a registration certificate from the Collector and that ""the concession shall, unless renewed by the Collector, cease on the expiry of the registration certificate"".

Admittedly, the registration certificate of the appellant expired on 31.12.1995. Hence, the exemption granted under the notification ceased on 31.12.1995. The fresh registration certificate in favour of the Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. was issued on 26.06.1996 and we find on a reading of the copy of the CT-2 certificate annexed as Annexure P5 that the registration certificate was not for any period prior to 26.06.1996. As the procedure laid down in Rule 192 of Chapter X of the Rules has not been complied with, the appellant is not entitled to avail the exemption of excise duty under the exemption notification during the period from 01.01.1996 to 25.06.1996.

9. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed but there shall be no order as to costs.

CIVIL APPEAL NO.8048 OF 2004:

This is an appeal under Section 35L (b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 against the order dated 02.07.2004 of the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, (for short ""the Tribunal"").

2. The facts very briefly are that the appellant produces inter alia Naphtha. By Notification no. 3/2001-CE dated 01.03.2001 (for short ""the exemption notification"") issued under Section 5A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short ""the Act"") the Central Government exempted inter alia Naphtha cleared for the intended use in the manufacture of fertilizers from excise duty subject to relevant conditions specified in the annexure to the notification. In the annexure to the exemption notification, one of the conditions specified was that where such use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the exemption shall be allowed if the procedure set out in the Central Excise (Removal of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty for  Manufacture of Excisable Goods) Rules, 2001 (for short ""the 2001 Rules"") is followed. Rule 3(1) of the 2001 Rules provided that a manufacturer who intends to receive subject goods for specified use at concessional rate of duty, shall make an application in quadruplicate in the Form at Annexure-1 to the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise, as the case may be. Indo Gulf Corporation Limited placed an order on 16.07.2001 on the appellant for supply of Naphtha for the purpose of manufacture of fertilizers and furnished a letter to the appellant saying it has made an application to the Commissioner of Excise for authorization for dispatch of one rake of Naphtha. The appellant supplied 2241.908 MT of Naphtha to Indo Gulf Corporation Limited and while clearing the aforesaid Naphtha from its factory did not make any payment of Central Excise duty. The Commissioner of Central Excise issued show cause notice dated 13.06.2002 to the appellant and after considering the reply of the appellant passed the order dated 30.09.2002 confirming the demand of duty amounting to Rs. 44,71,902/- on the Naphtha cleared on 16.07.2001 and also imposed a penalty  equivalent to the duty amount. The appellant filed an appeal against the order of the Commissioner before the Tribunal and the Tribunal held in the impugned order that under the exemption notification, the appellant could be exempted from duty on Naphtha supplied to the manufacturer of fertilizer only if the conditions specified in the exemption notification are fulfilled. The Tribunal further held that one of the conditions specified in the exemption notification was that where the goods were to be used elsewhere than in the factory of production, the exemption would be allowed if the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules was followed and in this case Rule 3(1) of 2001 Rules has not been followed, inasmuch as, the manufacturer, namely, Indo Gulf Corporation Limited had not submitted application in the form at Annexure-1 for obtaining Naphtha without payment of duty and had only cleared the Naphtha without payment of duty on the basis of a letter dated 16.07.2001 wherein it was mentioned that it has submitted its application to the Commissioner for issuance of authorization for dispatching one rake of Naphtha. The Tribunal held that as the condition of the exemption  notification has not been complied with, the appellant was not entitled to clear naphtha without payment of excise duty and accordingly sustained the demand of excise duty. The Tribunal also held that as the appellant had cleared Naphtha without payment of duty and without getting the requisite Annexure-1 from its customer, penalty was also imposable on the appellant, but on the facts and circumstances of the case the penalty was excessive. The Tribunal accordingly reduced the penalty to Rs.1,00,000/-

only.

3. Mr. Alok Yadav, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that as the Naphtha supplied to Indo Gulf Corporation Limited was in fact used for manufacture of fertilizer, the appellant was entitled to the benefit of exemption notification. He further submitted that as the appellant was a government company, he should not be denied the exemption on a technical ground that the application at Annexure-1 was not submitted to the authorities by the manufacturer of fertilizer as provided in Rule 3(1) of the 2001 Rules.

4. Mr. Anup Chaudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that one of the conditions specified in the exemption notification was that where the goods were to be used in the place other than in the factory of production, the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules has to be followed and in this case the procedure set out in Rule 3(1) of the 2001 Rules has not been followed.

5. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and we find that by the exemption notification the Central Government exempted the excisable goods from duty ""subject to the relevant conditions specified in the Annexure"" to the exemption notification. Paras 3 and 4 in the Annexure to the exemption notification read as follows:

""3. The exemption shall be allowed if it has been proved to the satisfaction of an officer not below the rank of the Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise or the Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise, as the case may be, having jurisdiction that such goods are cleared for the intended use specified in column 3 of the table.
4. Where such use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the exemption shall be allowed if the procedure set out in the Central Excise (Removal of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty for manufacture of Excisable Goods) Rules, 2001 is followed.""
It will be clear from Para 3 of the Annexure to the exemption notification that the exemption shall be allowed if it has been proved to the Central Excise Officer having jurisdiction that the goods are cleared for the intended use specified in column 3 of the table. In addition to this condition, there is a further condition in Para 4 of the Annexure to the exemption notification that where the intended use is elsewhere than the factory of production, the exemption shall be allowed if the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules is followed. We, therefore, do not accept the submission of Mr. Yadav that as the Naphtha cleared from the factory of the appellant has been used for manufacture of fertilizer, the appellant would be entitled to exemption even if the condition specified in Para 4 of the Annexure to the exemption notification is not followed.

6. The condition specified in Para 4 in the Annexure to the exemption notification states that where the intend use is elsewhere than in the factory of production, the exemption shall be allowed if the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules is followed. In the facts of this case, the Naphtha produced by the appellant in its factory was to be used for the manufacture of fertilizer elsewhere than in its own factory, i.e. in the factory of Indo Gulf Corporation Limited. Hence, the exemption could be allowed only if the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules was followed.

7. Rule 3(1) of the 2001 Rules is extracted hereinbelow:

""Rule 3. Application by the manufacturer to obtain the benefit. - (1) A manufacturer who intends to receive subject goods for specified use at concessional rate of duty, shall make an application in quadruplicate in the Form at Annexure-1 to the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise, as the case may be (hereinafter referred to as the said Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner).""

Rule 3(1) makes it amply clear that the manufacturer, who intends to use subject goods for specified use at  concessional rate of duty, shall make an application in quadruplicate in the Form at Annexure-1 to the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise, as the case may be.

Admittedly, no such application was made by Indo Gulf Corporation Limited in the form at Annexure-1 to the jurisdictional Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise. As the procedure set out in the 2001 Rules has not been followed, the appellant was not entitled to exemption on the Naphtha cleared from its factory for supply to Indo Gulf Corporation Limited for manufacture of fertilizer.

8. We, therefore, do not find any merit in the appeal and we accordingly dismiss the same. There shall be no order as to costs.",0,

1. Leave granted.

2. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated November 11, 2003 passed by the Allahabad High Court by which it allowed the writ petition filed by respondent nos. 1 and 2, set aside the order passed by the District Judge,  affirming the order of the Munsif, and held that the suit filed by the appellant was not maintainable being barred in terms of Order XXIII Rule 3-A of the Code of Civil Procedure.

3. The appellant filed a suit (No. 43 of 1980) in the court of Munsif, Karwi (Banda) seeking a declaration that the decree passed by the Assistant Collector, Class-I, in a suit under sections 176, 178 and 182 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act was fraudulent, inoperative and not binding upon him. According to the appellant, the defendants had instituted the suit before the Assistant Collector in which his father namely Chunkai was made as one of the opposite party. In that suit, a compromise petition was filed on October 7, 1971 with the fake signature of Chunkai and on that basis a compromise decree finally came to be passed on April 25, 1979. It is the case of the appellant that no notice of the suit was ever served upon his father Chunkai. He never appeared  in the proceeding and was not even aware of it. He did not sign any compromise petition and his alleged signature on the compromise petition dated October 7, 1971 was faked. He had died much earlier and was not even alive in 1979 when the decree was passed. The appellant, accordingly, sought a declaration that the decree dated April 25, 1979 passed by the Assistant Collector, Class-I, Karwi, may be cancelled or it may be declared as void ab initio, inoperative and not binding upon him.

4. The defendants (respondents 1 and 2 before this Court) filed a written statement in which they questioned the maintainability of the suit as well.

It was contended on their behalf that as the suit related to agricultural lands it was beyond the jurisdiction and competence of the civil court and it could only be tried by the revenue authorities.

The Munsif by his order dated October 1, 1985 upheld the defendants' objection and held that the suit was not maintainable before a civil court.

Against the order passed by the Munsif, the appellant preferred an appeal (M.C.A.No.21 of 1985) which was allowed by the judgment and order dated April 14, 1987 passed by the Additional District Judge, Karwi, (Banda). The Additional District Judge rightly pointed out that the suit filed by the appellant was based on the allegation that the decree passed by the Assistant Collector was based on a fraudulent compromise petition and it did not involve any adjudication of rights or interests in the agricultural lands. Hence, the suit was maintainable before a civil court. It, accordingly, set aside the order passed by the Munsif and directed him to proceed with the suit in accordance with law.

5. When the matter came before the Munsif on remand, the defendants once again objected to the maintainability of the suit, this time raising the contention that it was barred under the provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3-A of the Code of Civil  Procedure. The Munsif by his order dated January 7, 1988 dismissed the objection and found and held that the suit was maintainable. The defendants-

respondents took the matter in revision (Civil Revision No. Nil of 1988) which was dismissed by the District Judge, Banda, by his order dated February 17, 1988. Against the orders passed by the Munsif and the District Judge, the defendants preferred a writ petition before the High Court and the High Court, as noted above, allowed the writ petition holding that the suit was not maintainable. It is a brief order in which the High Court referred to the provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3-A, and relying upon a decision of the Allahabad High Court allowed the writ petition.

6. It is true that a compromise forming the basis of the decree can only be questioned before the same court that recorded the comprise and a fresh suit for setting aside a compromise decree is expressly barred under Order XXIII Rule 3-A. It is  equally true the expression ""not lawful"" used in Rule 3-A of Order XXIII also covers a decree based on a fraudulent compromise hence, a challenge to a compromise decree on the ground that it was obtained by fraudulent means would also fall under the provisions of Rule 3-A of Order XXIII.

7. In Banwari Lal Vs. Chando Devi (1993) 1 SCC 581, this Court examined the provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3-A in some detail and in light of the amendments introduced in the Code and in paragraph 7 of the judgment came to hold as follows:

""7. By adding the proviso along with an explanation the purpose and the object of the amending Act appears to be to compel the party challenging the compromise to question the same before the court which had recorded the compromise in question. That court was enjoined to decide the controversy whether the parties have arrived at an adjustment in a lawful manner. The explanation made it clear that an agreement or a compromise which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of the said rule. Having introduced the proviso along with the explanation in Rule 3 in order to avoid multiplicity of suit and prolonged  litigation, a specific bar was prescribed by Rule 3-A in respect of institution of a separate suit for setting aside a decree on basis of a compromise saying:
""3-A. Bar to suit.- No suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is based was not lawful.""
It further held in paragraphs 13 and 14 as follows:-

""13. When the amending Act introduced a proviso along with an explanation to Rule 3 of Order 23 saying that where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that an adjustment or satisfaction has been arrived at,""the Court shall decide the question"", the Court before which a petition of compromise is filed and which has recorded such compromise, has to decide the question whether an adjustment or satisfaction had been arrived at on basis of any lawful agreement. To make the enquiry in respect of validity of the agreement or the compromise more comprehensive, the explanation to the proviso says that an agreement or compromise ""which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act....""
shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of the said Rule. In view of the proviso read with the explanation, a Court which had entertained the petition of compromise has to examine whether the  compromise was void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act. Even Rule 1(m) of Order 43 has been deleted under which an appeal was maintainable against an order recording a compromise. As such a party challenging a compromise can file a petition under proviso to Rule 3 of Order 23, or an appeal under Section 96(1) of the Code, in which he can now question the validity of the compromise in view of Rule 1-A of Order 43 of the Code.""

14. .................The court before which it is alleged by one of the parties to the alleged compromise that no such compromise had been entered between the parties that court has to decide whether the agreement or compromise in question was lawful and not void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act. If the agreement or the compromise itself is fraudulent then it shall be deemed to be void within the meaning of the explanation to the proviso to Rule 3 and as such not lawful. The learned Subordinate Judge was perfectly justified in entertaining the application filed on behalf of the appellant and considering the question as to whether there had been a lawful agreement or compromise on the basis of which the court could have recorded such agreement or compromise on February 27, 1991. Having come to the conclusion on the material produced that the compromise was not lawful within the meaning of Rule 3, there was no option left except to recall that order.""

8. In light of the decision in Banwari Lal it would prima facie appear that the High Court was right in holding that the appellant's suit was hit by the provisions of Order XXIII Rule 3-A and was not maintainable. But the significant distinguishing feature in this case is that the compromise decree which is alleged to be fraudulent and which is sought to be declared as nullity was passed not by a civil court but by a revenue court in a suit under section 176 of the U.P. Zamindari Abolition & Land Reforms Act, 1950 (hereinafter the Act).

9. Section 331 of the Act bars the jurisdiction of the civil court and provides that a suit under the Act can be entertained by no court other than that the courts specified in Schedule II to the Act. A reference to Schedule II would show that the court of original jurisdiction for a suit under section 176 of the Act for division of a holding of a Bhumidhar is Assistant Collector,  First Class and the courts of First Appeal and Second Appeal are Commissioner and the Board of revenue respectively. Section 341 of the Act, of course, provides that unless otherwise expressly provided by or under the Act, the provisions of the Indian Court Fee Act, 1870, the Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Limitation Act, 1963, including section 5 thereof would apply to the proceedings under the Act.

10. Though the provisions of the Code Of Civil Procedure have been made applicable to the proceedings under the Act but that would not make the authorities specified under Schedule II to the Act as `court' under the Code and those authorities shall continue to be ""courts"" of limited and restricted jurisdiction.

11. We are of the view that Revenue courts are neither equipped nor competent to effectively adjudicate on allegations of fraud that has overtones of criminality and the courts really  skilled and experienced to try such issues are the courts constituted under the Code of Civil Procedure.

12. It is also well settled that under section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, the civil court has inherent jurisdiction to try all types of civil disputes unless its jurisdiction is barred expressly or by necessary implication, by any statutory provision and conferred on any other tribunal or authority. We find nothing in Order XXIII Rule 3-A to bar the institution of a suit before the civil court even in regard to decrees or orders passed in suits and/or proceedings under different statutes before a court, tribunal or authority of limited and restricted jurisdiction.

13. In our view in the facts of the case the provision of Order XXIII shall not act as a bar against the suit filed by the appellant. We, accordingly set aside the order of the High Court.

As a consequence, the suit will be restored before  the Munsif who is directed to accord it priority having regard to the fact that for the last 31 years it is stuck up on the issue of maintainability. The trial court should try to dispose of the suit without any delay, and in any case, not later than one year from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.

2. The short point for decision in this Appeal is whether an employer can take disciplinary action  against an employee in regard to acts purported to have been done by him in his previous employment in an affiliated society.

3. The Respondent No.1 herein was an employee of Raipur Krishi Unnayan Samity (hereinafter referred to as ""the Samity""), a cooperative society affiliated to the Burdwan Central Cooperative Bank, the Appellant herein. Under its Recruitment Rules, the Bank was entitled to recruit people from the affiliated societies through a regular recruitment process. In the recruitment process held in 1997, the Bank appointed the Respondent No.1 as a Grade III Staff of the Bank by an appointment letter dated 8th September, 1997. On being offered the said appointment, the Respondent No.1 left the services of the Samity where he was working and joined the Bank pursuant to the appointment letter issued to him.

4. While the Respondent No.1 was serving in the Bank, the Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Burdwan-I, lodged a complaint with the Bank that during an enquiry conducted by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, it had transpired that the Respondent No.1 had committed various financial irregularities in maintaining the accounts of the Samity. In view of the above, the Assistant Registrar recommended that action be taken against him.

5. On the basis of the said complaint, the Bank issued a charge-sheet to the Respondent No.1 on 2nd February, 2000. Although, according to the Bank, the said Respondent admitted his guilt in his reply to the charge-sheet, a full-fledged enquiry was held by the Bank by appointing an Enquiry Officer and affording the Respondent No.1 adequate opportunity to defend himself, since according to him, he had been forced to sign a letter of  confession. On conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings, the Enquiry Officer found the Respondent No.1 guilty of the charges brought against him. On the basis of the Enquiry Report, the Bank through its Chief Executive Officer, being the Disciplinary Authority of the Respondent No.1, passed an order of dismissal on 8th May, 2000. It appears that neither a copy of the Enquiry Report nor the second show-cause notice was served upon the Respondent No.1.

6. Aggrieved by the order of the Disciplinary Authority, the Respondent No.1 filed a Writ Petition challenging the order of dismissal. The learned Single Judge who heard the matter, allowed the Writ Petition by holding that the dismissal order had been passed by the Bank with the mala fide intention of getting rid of the Respondent No.1. The learned Judge held that the Bank had no authority to proceed against the Respondent No.1 on  the allegation of defalcation of the funds of the Samity at a point of time when he was not an employee of the Bank. In addition, the learned Judge held that the order of the Disciplinary Authority was vitiated as the Respondent No.1 was not served with a copy of the Enquiry Report, nor was any opportunity given to him by way of a second show-cause notice to offer his explanation thereto.

7. The Bank preferred First Misc. Appeal No.301 of 2005 against the aforesaid order, wherein the attention of the Division Bench was drawn to the provisions of the West Bengal Cooperative Rules, 1987, wherein it has been stipulated that any mis-

appropriation of the employer's business or property would come within the mischief of ""misconduct"". It was urged on behalf of the Bank that since the Samity was affiliated to the Bank, defalcation of the funds of the Samity would attract the definition of ""misconduct"" and the  Respondent No.1 had been rightly proceeded with departmentally. It was, however, admitted before the Division Bench that the Bank had dismissed the Respondent No.1 without affording him an adequate opportunity of explaining his version on the findings of the enquiry by serving him a copy of the Enquiry Report as well as the second show-cause notice.

8. On the submissions made on behalf of the parties, the Division Bench affirmed the view expressed by the learned Single Judge that the Bank could not have proceeded against the Respondent No.1 in respect of an illegality and/or misconduct which had allegedly been committed when he was not an employee of the Bank. Accordingly, without commenting on the findings of the learned Single Judge with regard to the allegations of mala fide and/or biased attitude on the part of the Bank, the Division Bench held that the Bank was not entitled  to proceed against the Respondent No.1 in law and disposed of the Appeal accordingly.

9. As indicated hereinbefore, the present Appeal is directed against the said judgment and order of the Calcutta High Court.

10. Mr. Tarun Kumar Ray, learned senior advocate appearing for the Appellant-Bank, urged that the Respondent No.1 had not been prejudiced in any way on account of non-supply of the report of the Enquiry Officer or in the absence of a second show-

cause notice, as was earlier envisaged under Article 311(2) of the Constitution prior to its amendment by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976. Mr. Ray submitted that as had been held by this Court in Managing Director, E.C.I.L. vs. B.

Karunakar [(1993) 4 SCC 727], the order of reinstatement for non-furnishing of Enquiry Report to the concerned employee would depend on the extent of prejudice caused to him and could not be  ordered as a matter of course. It was, however, mentioned that a copy of the Enquiry Report, if not served earlier, should be provided to the employee before arguments were allowed to be advanced and thereafter the court should apply its judicial mind before setting aside the punishment on a finding that prejudice has been caused to the concerned employee. The Court held further that this was the minimum compliance of the rules of natural justice while awarding major penalties.

11. In support of his contention that even though the Respondent No.1 was not under the administrative control of the Appellant when the alleged irregularity was perpetrated, the Appellant-Bank was still entitled to commence disciplinary proceedings against him, Mr. Ray referred to the decision of this Court in S.

Govinda Menon vs. Union of India [(1967) 2 SCR 566]. In the said decision this Court had held that  even if an employee was not subject to the administrative control of the Government when he was functioning as Commissioner, his acts or omissions as Commissioner could form the subject matter of disciplinary proceedings, provided the act or omission reflected on his reputation for integrity or devotion to duty as a member of the service.

12. Mr. Ray urged that in the instant case there was no prejudice caused to the Respondent No.1 either by the non-service of the report of the Enquiry Officer or by the non-issuance of a second show-cause notice, which merited interference by the High Court with the decision to terminate the services of Respondent No.1. Mr. Ray submitted that in B. Karunakar's case (supra) it had been held that the failure to provide the Enquiry Report was not fatal to the disciplinary proceedings which could be re-commenced from the stage prior to  arguments, after supply of a copy of the Enquiry Officer's report which resulted in the termination of the services of the Respondent No.1. Mr. Ray further submitted that since no prejudice had been caused to the Respondent, in the above-mentioned circumstances the decision of the High Court to set aside the said Respondent's order of termination was not warranted in law and the judgments of both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench were, therefore, liable to be set aside.

13. On the other hand, Mr. Gupta appearing for the Respondent No. 1 submitted that the learned Single Judge had rightly arrived at the conclusion that the dismissal of the Respondent No.1 was tainted with malafides on the part of the Bank to get rid of him. Mr. Gupta also contended that the High Court had rightly held that the dismissal of the Respondent on the basis of an allegation of defalcation of the funds of the Samity, when he was  not even an employee of the Bank, was wholly without jurisdiction, as he was not answerable to the Bank for whatever allegations that may have been made against him in his previous employment under the Raipur Krishi Unnayan Samity, which was a co-operative society affiliated to the Appellant-

Bank. Mr. Gupta further submitted that in the absence of employer-employee relationship at the time when the alleged defalcation is said to have been committed, the Appellant co-operative Bank ought not to have proceeded against the Respondent No.1 in disciplinary proceedings, and, thereafter, dismissed him from service. Mr.Gupta submitted that the order of the learned Single Judge, as well as that of the Division Bench, was based on a correct appreciation of the law and did not merit interference in the appeal.

14. Having carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and having  regard to the fact that the Respondent No.1 was an employee of the Samity, which was a cooperative society affiliated to the Appellant Cooperative Bank herein, there was a link between the previous employment of the Respondent No.1 and his subsequent appointment under the Appellant-Bank.

It has to be kept in mind that under its Recruitment Rules, the Appellant-Bank was entitled to recruit people from the affiliated societies through a regular recruitment process.

Accordingly, even though the Respondent No.1 was employed by a different Cooperative Society, the same had a link with the Appellant-Cooperative Bank on the basis whereof the Respondent No.1 was appointed by the Appellant-Bank on 8th September, 1997.

15. There is no denial of the fact that the Respondent No.1 came to be appointed by the Appellant-Bank on a temporary basis as a Grade-III  employee in the quota reserved for the employees of Primary Cooperative Societies affiliated to the District Central Cooperative Bank in terms of Rule 69(2)(b) of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rules, 1987. The provisions of Rule 69(2)(b) of the 1987 Rules, which are relevant in this case, provides as follows :

""69. Minimum paid staff to be employed by a co-operative society, their respective essential qualifications and procedure of their employment and the conditions of their service -
     (1)     xxx xxx xxx xxx



     (2)     The   posts   shall   be   filled   up   in   the 

     following manner :-



     (a)     .........;

     (b)     not   more   than   twenty-five   percent   of 

the sanctioned posts in the establishment of an apex or central society shall be filled up by promotion of fit and suitable employees of the societies affiliated to it;
     (c)     ............;

     (d)     ...............;

     (e)     ...................""



         








16. In keeping with the above, the Appellant-Bank appointed the Respondent No.1 against the quota reserved for the employees of Primary Cooperative Societies affiliated to the Respondent-Bank in terms of Rule 69(2)(b) of the 1987 Rules. Mr. Ray appears to be correct in his contention that in view of the above link between the Primary Cooperative Society and the Appellant-Bank, even though the Respondent No.1 was not under the administrative control of the Appellant-Bank when he allegedly committed various financial irregularities, the Appellant-Bank was still entitled to commence disciplinary proceedings against him in view of his past conduct. The decision of this Court in S. Govinda Menon's case (supra), cited by Mr. Ray, also has a direct bearing on the facts of this case, where, although the Respondent No.1 was not under the administrative control of the Appellant-Bank, prior to his service with the Bank, his previous conduct  was a blot on his integrity and devotion to duty as a member of the service. Since no prejudice had been caused to the Respondent No.1 by the non-
supply of the Enquiry Officer's report or the second show-cause notice under Article 311(2) of the Constitution, the Respondent No.1 had little scope to contend that the principles of natural justice had been violated which had vitiated the proceedings.

17. However, there is one aspect of the matter which cannot be ignored. In B. Karunakar's case (supra), despite holding that non-supply of a copy of the report of the Inquiry Officer to the employee facing a disciplinary proceeding, amounts to denial of natural justice, in the later part of the judgment it was observed that whether in fact, prejudice has been caused to the employee on account of non-furnishing of a copy of the inquiry report has to be considered in the facts of each  case. It was observed that where the furnishing of the inquiry report would not make any difference to the ultimate outcome of the matter, it would be a perversion of justice to allow the concerned employee to resume his duties and to get all consequential benefits. It was also observed that in the event the Inquiry Officer's report had not been furnished to the employee in the disciplinary proceedings, a copy of the same should be made available to him to enable him to explain as to what prejudice had been caused to him on account of non-supply of the report. It was held that the order of punishment should not be set aside mechanically on the ground that the copy of the inquiry report had not been supplied to the employee. This is, in fact, a case where the order of punishment had been passed against the Respondent No.1 on allegations of financial irregularity. Such an allegation would require serious consideration as to whether the services of  an employee against whom such allegations have been raised should be retained in the service of the Bank. Since a Bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in regard to people's investments, the very legitimacy of the banking system depends on the complete integrity of its employees. As indicated hereinbefore, there is a live-link between the Respondent No.1's performance as an employee of the Samity, which was affiliated to the Bank, and if the Bank was of the view that his services could not be retained on account of his previous misdemeanor, it is then that the second part of B.

Karunakar's case (supra) becomes attracted and it becomes necessary for the court to examine whether any prejudice has been caused to the employee or not before punishment is awarded to him. It is not as if the Bank with an ulterior motive or a hidden agenda dismissed the Respondent No.1 from service, in fact, he was selected and appointed in the Appellant-Bank on account of his merit and  performance at the time of interview. It cannot be said that the Bank harboured any ill-feeling towards the Respondent No.1 which ultimately resulted in the order of dismissal passed on 8th May, 2010. We, therefore, repeat that since no prejudice has been caused to the Respondent No.1 by the non-supply of the Inquiry Officer's report, the said Respondent had little scope to contend that the disciplinary proceedings had been vitiated on account of such non-supply.

18. In the above circumstances, we cannot agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge, as affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court, that the Appellant-Bank had no jurisdiction to proceed against the Respondent No.1 by way of disciplinary proceedings in regard to the allegations of defalcation made against him while he was employed under the Co-operative Samity which was an affiliate of the Appellant-Bank. The other  decision cited by Mr. Ray in S. Govinda Menon's case (supra) also makes it abundantly clear that even though the Respondent No.1 may not have been under the direct administrative control of the Bank at the relevant point of time when the defalcation is alleged to have taken place, on account of the affiliation of the Samity with the Bank under the provisions of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Rules, 1987, the Appellant-Bank had jurisdiction over the Respondent No.1 after he joined the employment of the Appellant-Bank. In the instant case, since the question of integrity in managing the accounts of the Samity is in question, it was but natural for the Bank to proceed departmentally against the Respondent No.1 after coming to learn of the allegations which have been made against him.

19. In our view, both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court were not  justified in interfering with the action taken by the disciplinary authorities of the Bank and their findings are liable to be set aside. The appeal, therefore, succeeds and is allowed. The orders of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court, are set aside. The decision taken by the Bank in dismissing the Respondent No.1 from service is restored.

20. There will be no order as to costs.",1,
Om Prakash Asati,"JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.

1. The petitioner herein, having qualified the B.E. examination, came to be appointed as Assistant Engineer, in the Local Self Engineering Department of the State of Uttar Pradesh, on 3.3.1974. The Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Act was enacted in 1975. The aforesaid enactment resulted in the creation of the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam (hereinafter referred to as, the Jal Nigam). In 1976 the services of the petitioner came to be allocated to the Jal Nigam, where the petitioner was absorbed against the post of Assistant Engineer, on regular basis. While in the employment of the Jal Nigam, the petitioner came to be promoted to the post of Executive Engineer, on 1.6.1996.

2. It is the claim of the petitioner, that on the eve of his attaining the age of 50 years in January 2001, his claim for retention in service was placed before a Screening Committee. The Screening Committee found the petitioner fit to continue in service. It is therefore, that the petitioner remained in the employment of the Jal Nigam beyond the age of 50 years. The instant stance adopted by the petitioner is seriously contested at the hands of the respondents. It is the assertion of the respondents, that the Screening Committee did not evaluate the claim of the petitioner for extension in service beyond the age of the 50 years, on account of the fact that a departmental inquiry was pending against him. The position adopted by the respondents in our considered view is wholly unjustified. Even after the culmination of the departmental proceedings, the petitioner was permitted to continue in service. It is therefore apparent, that the petitioner satisfied the standards adopted by the Jal Nigam, for continuation in service beyond the age of 50 years, and as such, his continuation thereafter must be deemed to have been with the implied approval of his employer, the Jal Nigam.

3. By orders dated 1.9.2005, several employees of the Jal Nigam, including the petitioner, were prematurely retired from service. The aforesaid order (pertaining to the petitioner) is available on the record of this case as Annexure P1. A perusal thereof reveals, that the retirement of the petitioner had been ordered, in exercise of powers emerging from  the amended provisions of Fundamental Rule 56(c) of the Financial Handbook, Volume II (Parts II to IV). The instant provision is being extracted hereunder :

""56(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or clause (b), the appointing authority may, at any time by notice to any Government servant (whether permanent or temporary), without assigning any reason, require him to retire after he attains the age of fifty years or such Government servant may by notice to the appointing authority voluntarily retire at any time after attaining the age of forty five years or after he has completed qualifying service of twenty years"".
4. It is the case of the petitioner, that the Screening Committee which evaluated the case of the petitioner for continuation in service, had adopted a criterion for screening the claim of the employees of the Jal Nigam. Under the said criterion, marks were awarded to the employees falling in the zone of consideration. The afore stated criterion provided for deduction of one mark for every adverse entry, as well as, for every punishment awarded during the course of employment. Marks were awarded keeping in mind the employees annual assessment. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the criterion framed by the Screening Committee also postulated, that an employee who had been awarded a punishment of recovery, as also, an employee who had deposited any amount towards recovery, as a result of some fault/mistake committed by him in the discharge of his duties, would be a valid ground for the employee to be prematurely retired. It is also the  contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that based on the criterion adopted by the Jal Nigam, an employee belonging to the general category would be entitled to continue in service only if he was awarded 9 or more marks. For an employee belonging to the reserved categories, the Jal Nigam had prescribed a minimum of 6 marks for retention in service.

5. The first and foremost contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioner was, that the criterion adopted by the Jal Nigam was illegal and unacceptable in law, as the same was in complete derogation of Fundamental Rule 56(c). It was therefore prayed, that the impugned order be set aside on account of the fact, that while passing the same the respondents had taken the decision on the petitioners suitability by applying a criterion which was wholly illegal and unsustainable in law. In order to substantiate his contention, learned counsel for the petitioner invited our attention to a decision rendered by a Division Bench of the High Court of judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) in Mahesh Chandra Agrawal vs. State of U.P. and Ors. (Writ Petition No.1888 (S/B) of 2005, decided on 27.3.2006), as well as, on another judgment rendered by the same Division Bench in Naresh Kumar Aggarwal vs. State of U.P. and Ors. (Writ Petition No.1955 (S/B) of 2005, decided on 19.7.2006). Relying on the aforesaid two judgments, it was the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the criterion relied upon to pass the impugned order against the petitioner (in the instant case) had been  considered by the Division Bench which decided the aforesaid two cases, and the same had been set aside as being unsustainable in law. It is also brought to our notice by the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the orders dated 27.3.2006 and 19.7.2006 passed by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) were assailed before this Court, but the petitions for special leave to appeal, were dismissed. It is therefore the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the determination rendered by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) on the issue of validity of the criterion adopted by the Jal Nigam in prematurely retiring its employees under Fundamental Rule 56(c) had attained finality. Based on the aforesaid assertions, it is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, that the impugned order of premature retirement, passed in the instant case against the petitioner on 1.6.1996, was also liable to be set aside.

6. Insofar as the first contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned, it would be relevant to notice, that the petitioner assailed the impugned order dated 1.9.2005 before the High Court of judicature at Allahabad by filing Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.64396 of 2005. The aforesaid writ petition came to be dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court on 3.5.2006. Dissatisfied with the impugned order dated 3.5.2006, the petitioner preferred Civil Miscellaneous Review Application No.144184 of 2006. The said Review Application was also  dismissed on 29.2.2008. The orders dated 3.5.2006 and 29.9.2008 rendered by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad besides the order of premature retirement dated 1.9.2005, have been assailed by the petitioner through this petition.

7. In order to repudiate the first contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned counsel for the respondents vehemently contended, that the petitioner is not entitled to raise the instant issue before this Court on account of the fact, that the criterion adopted by the Screening Committee which had led to the passing of the impugned order of premature retirement dated 1.9.2005, had not been assailed by the petitioner before the High Court. It is also contended, that the evaluation of the record of the petitioner independently of the criterion adopted by the Screening Committee would also establish, that the Jal Nigam was fully justified in passing the impugned order of premature retirement dated 1.9.2005.

8. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the first contention at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioner. In our considered view in the judgments rendered by the Division Bench of the High Court of judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) in Writ Petition No.1888 (S/B) of 2005 and Writ Petition No.1955 (S/B) of 2005 it was held, that the criterion adopted by the Screening Committee for prematurely retiring the employees of the Jal Nigam was illegal and not in consonance with law. A  plea of the nature canvassed at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents (as has been noticed in the foregoing paragraph), is no longer available to the respondents to defeat the claim of the petitioner. The validity of the criterion adopted by the Jal Nigam for prematurely retiring its employees is a pure question of law. The same having attained finality against the respondents, is liable to be respectfully adhered to. We therefore, hereby, deprecate the action of the respondents in canvassing the instant proposition. Once a challenge raised at the hands of the respondents to the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner remained futile before this Court, the same should have been accepted without any further protestation. We, therefore, hereby reject the contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents that the criterion adopted by the Jal Nigam was enforceable against the petitioner herein.

9. The question which still arises for consideration is, whether the setting aside of the criterion adopted by the Screening Committee would ipso facto result in the negation of the impugned order dated 1.9.2005 (by which the petitioner was prematurely retired from service)? According to the learned counsel for the respondents, even if the criterion adopted by the Screening Committee (for the sake of arguments), is accepted as invalid in law, the impugned order of premature retirement dated 1.9.2005 will have to be independently examined in the light of the material taken  into consideration by the Screening Committee. According to the learned counsel for the respondents the impugned order dated 1.9.2005, if so evaluated, would stand the scrutiny of law.

10. During the course of consideration of the present controversy, we had the occasion of going through the judgments rendered by the High Court of judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) in Writ Petition No.1888 (S/B) of 2005, and in Writ Petition No.1955 (S/B) of 2005. In both the aforesaid decisions, after the High Court accepted the contention of the respective petitioner therein, and set aside the criterion adopted by the Selection Committee, the Court shorn of the parameters laid down in the said criterion, independently evaluated the veracity of the impugned orders of premature retirement. This exercise was sought to be carried out on the basis of the record taken into consideration by the Screening Committee in arriving at the conclusion that the petitioner deserved to be retired prematurely. The High Court therefore examined at its own, whether there were sufficient reasons for passing the impugned orders of premature retirement against the concerned petitioners. We are of the view, that the course adopted by the High Court in both the aforesaid cases, was just an appropriate. We, therefore, hereby uphold the instant contention at the hands of the learned counsel for the respondents, that the impugned order dated 1.9.2005 passed by the Jal Nigam, prematurely retiring the petitioner from its employment, cannot be set aside merely because the criterion  adopted by the Jal Nigam has been set aside. The veracity of the impugned order will have to be examined independently of the criterion so as to determine, whether or not the impugned order is sustainable on the basis of the record taken into consideration by the Screening Committee.

11. It is the aforesaid determination at our hands, that prompted the learned counsel for the petitioner to raise the second contention, namely, that the material taken into consideration for prematurely retiring the petitioner did not justify the passing of the impugned order dated 1.9.2005. Insofar as the instant contention is concerned, learned counsel for the rival parties invited out attention to Annexure R/4 (appended to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Jal Nigam), i.e. a compilation of the service profile of the petitioner. A perusal thereof reveals, that the entries recorded in the Confidential Reports of the petitioner for the preceding 10 years were outlined therein. The entries taken into consideration were for the years 1994-1995 to 2003-2004. Shorn of further details it would be relevant to mention, that out of the aforesaid entries the work and conduct of the petitioner for the years 1997-1998, 1998-1999, 1999-2000 and 2002-2003 were recorded as ""satisfactory"". Entries for the year 1996- 1997, 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 were recorded as ""good"". For the remaining two entries, the one for the year 1994-1995 was recorded as ""very good"" and for a part of the year of 1995-1996 the work of the petitioner was assessed as ""excellent"". It is therefore apparent from  the Annual Confidential Report of the petitioner, that over the last decade, preceding the impugned order dated 1.9.2005, there has been a regular and consistent deterioration from ""excellent"" and ""very good"" to ""satisfactory"". In fact in as many as 4 of the preceding 7 years, the work and conduct of the petitioner was evaluated as ""satisfactory"". The compilation Annexure R/4 also outlines the various orders of punishment inflected on the petitioner. The orders of punishment taken into consideration were dated 18.4.2002, 23.11.2004 and 4.1.2005. The petitioner was punished 3 times in the preceding 4 years. Details in respect of the orders of punishment were mentioned in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents. Its summary was also made available for our consideration. The said summary, pertaining to the orders of punishment, is being extracted hereunder:

""That the case of the petitioner was also screened and the petitioner has earned only 5.59 marks out of 30 marks which shows that his performance during last 10 years was not satisfactory. Besides this, vide Office Order dated 18.4.2002 in respect of irregularities inviting in tenders it has been found that the petitioner has not compared the rate offered by the contractor with Schedule G and H which is a gross negligence, hence he should be given a warning to be more cautious in future (Annexure R/1).
That again vide office order dated 23.11.2004 it has been found that respondent while posted as Executive Engineer at Lalitpur did not reside at Lalitpur and used to come from Jhansi which is against the Rules. Further it has been found that there has been delay in work, excess payment, financial irregularity and mis-utilization of funds because the petitioner could not had administrative control while discharging his responsibilities which is proved, hence a warning to  this effect has been issued to the petitioner and it is directed that the order be kept in his personal file and character roll (Annexure R/2). That again vide Officer Order dated 04.01.2005 after completion of an enquiry against the respondent and relevant documents it has been found that all the charges against him is proved regarding the incident at Kanpur while he was working as Project Manager in Ganga Pollution Control Unit in which 6 labourers have died and the Corporation had to pay compensation in respect of their death. Hence he has been awarded censor entry and his two increments were withheld. It was further directed that the said order be kept in his character roll and personal file (Annexure R/3)"".
From the above it is apparent, that the claim of the petitioner was considered by the Screening Committee on the basis of the annual entries in his service record and the punishments suffered by him during the recent past.

12. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the material taken into consideration by the Screening Committee before passing the impugned order dated 1.9.2005. Besides the gradual deterioration in his career-graph noticeable from the last 7 years of his service (before the impugned order was passed), wherein 4 annual reports assessed the work and conduct of the petitioner as ""average"". It is also apparent that punishment orders were passed against the petitioner on 3 occasions within the last 4 years. These punishments were ordered because of negligence and irregularity in granting tenders; delay in work, excess payment, financial irregularity and mis-utilization of funds, lack of administrative control; and death of 6 labourers because of lack of  supervision by the petitioner which resulted in huge financial loss by way of compensation which had to be paid to the families of the deceased labourers. Based on the aforesaid, it would not be incorrect to conclude, that there was a gradual deterioration in the overall performance of the petitioner. In the aforesaid view of the matter, it is not possible for us to find fault with the impugned order of premature retirement dated 1.9.2005. We are therefore satisfied, that the service record of the petitioner was objectively evaluated. Thus viewed, the passing of the impugned order cannot be described as arbitrary or unfair in any manner. The deliberations adopted by the Jal Nigam while passing the impugned order dated 1.9.2005 are, therefore, not liable to be interfered with.

13. For the reasons recorded hereinabove we are of the view, that the impugned orders dated 27.3.2006 and 19.7.2006 passed by the High Court, upholding the order dated 1.9.2005, were fully justified and call for no interference.

2. This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Gujarat dated 22.04.2008 in Special Civil Application No.24233/2007, whereby the Respondent No. 1 herein, Essar Oil Limited (hereinafter ""Essar"") was given the benefit of Sales Tax incentive under the Government of Gujarat  ""Capital Investment Incentive to Premier/Prestigious Unit Scheme, 1995-2000"" (hereinafter ""the said Scheme"")

3. The State Government in the Industries and Mines Department vide Resolution dated 11.09.1995 introduced the said scheme to accelerate development of the backward area of the State and to create large-scale employment opportunities.

4. The operative period of the said scheme was from 16.08.1995 upto 15.08.2000, during which new units have to go into commercial production.

5. The Scheme envisaged grant of Sales Tax incentives by way of Sales Tax Exemption or Sales Tax Deferment or Composite Schemes, for Premier/Prestigious Units according to the location, investment and status of the project. Essar fell in the category of premier unit i.e. new industrial unit having a project cost  of more than Rs.1,000/- crores and employing 100 workers on a regular basis and following the employment policy of the State Government. Clause

(v) of the Scheme defined premier unit in the following terms:-

""(v) PREMIER UNIT A new industrial unit or industrial complex fulfilling the following criteria will be considered for granting status of a ""Premier Unit"".

(a) The industrial unit shall have a project cost of Rs.500 crores or more. Such units having project cost of Rs.1,000 crores and above shall be entitled for extended period to avail incentive as provided under para 6 B.

(b) Only one unit per taluka will be eligible for the Premier Unit status. In banned area no unit is permitted.

(c) The unit shall employ at least 100 workers on a regular basis and shall follow the employment policy of the State Government.""

6. Part II of the said Scheme provided that the rate of incentive would depend on the location, investment and status of the project. The incentives offered  were sales-tax exemption or sales-tax deferment or composite scheme. There is no dispute about the fact that Essar opted for sales-tax deferment scheme. As per clause 6(i)(B), the rate of incentive applicable to Essar was the rate available for the most backward area. The extent of exemption was 125% of eligible fixed capital investment.

7. Part II Clause (iii) (b) provided that Under the Sales Tax Deferment incentive scheme, the recovery of sales tax connected by the unit on sale of goods manufactured by it including intermediate products, by products and scrap/waste generated as incidental to manufacturing activities and turnover tax, leviable to Government will be deferred and amount so deferred will be recovered in six equal annual installments by Sales Tax Department beginning from the financial year subsequent to the year in which the unit exhausts limit of incentive granted to it under the scheme or after the expiry of relevant period or time limit during which deferment is available or whichever is earlier.

8. Since Essar's investment was going to be more than Rs.1,000 crores, the duration of incentive of sales-

tax deferment was to be for a period of 17 years from the date of commercial production.

9. Clause 6(v) of the said Scheme provided for effective steps for extending date of commercial production in the following terms :

""6(v) Effective steps for extending date of commercial production :

The unit which cannot go into commercial production before expiry of the scheme will be allowed to go into commercial production beyond the last date of the scheme provided it has taken the following effective steps:

(1) The industrial unit should have obtained provisional registration as a Prestigious/Premier unit before 15th August 2000.

(2) 25% of project cost should have been incurred before 15th August 2000. The unit which has taken above effective steps will be allowed to go into commercial production as shown below:

(a) The unit with project cost above Rs.100 crores but below Rs.300 crores should go into commercial production on or before 15th August 2002.

(b) The unit with project cost more than Rs.300 crores should go into commercial production on or before 15th February 2003.

Such units shall have to apply to industries Commissioner for extending date of commercial production by 31st August 2000.""

11.Part III provides the procedure for Registration for Premier/Prestigious Status, the relevant clause of the said Part in respect of instant case is set out below:

""An Industrial unit eligible for Prestigious/Premier status under the scheme will apply to Industries Commissioner in prescribed form before expiry of the scheme along with details of following effective steps.

i) Possession of plot or shed in GIDC Estate.

           prestigious/premier                                                        registration, 

Industries Commissioner will carryout the assets verification and submit a verification report to the High Power State Level Committee, for granting permanent registration.""

12.Some relevant facts which arose prior to the floating of the Scheme and which are necessary for appreciating the said Scheme, as contended by Essar and which the records also shows, are as under.

13.Essar was encouraged by the State Government to set up a major venture at Vadinar in Jamnagar District of Gujarat as a 100% export oriented unit for refining of petroleum products with a capacity of 9 Million Tons per annum at an estimated project cost of Rs. 1900 crores in collaboration with M/s Bechtel Inc., USA.

14.By letter dated 11th April, 1990, the then Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat wrote to the Ministry of Planning, Government of India, stating that the project was expected to generate foreign exchange earnings of over Rs.3000 crores within a period of 5 years and that it was expected to be set up in 36 months. It was anticipated by the State Government that the project would ""completely change the face of the Vadinar area, which is traditionally a backward area of Gujarat offering direct and indirect employment and will encourage growth of various other ancillary industries in that region"".

The letter further said that the project had the  full support of the Government of Gujarat and it was being accorded highest priority and that Essar's proposal for setting up the oil refinery should be cleared by the Government of India urgently. The clearance for setting up the oil refinery was then granted by the Government of India.

15.In January, 1993, Essar applied to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) for grant of a `No Objection Certificate' to establish the refinery for manufacturing several kinds of petroleum products.

By letter dated 15th February, 1993, the GPCB stated that it had no objection from the Environmental Pollution potential point of view in the setting up of the refinery project subject to certain environmental pollution control measures to be taken by the appellant. Essar's proposal regarding the environmental pollution control system was approved by the GPCB on 17th April, 1993 and a Site Clearance Certificate was issued on that date.

16. On 10.11.1994, Essar filed an application for right of way over 15.49 hectares of forest land for laying Submarine Crude Oil Pipeline, Cooling Water/Return Water Pipeline and Product Jetty for establishment of its Refinery Project at Vadinar, District Jamnagar, to the Conservator of Forests, Marine National Park, Jamnagar. Undisputedly, 15.49 hectares of forest land applied for includes 8.79 hectares of Jamnagar Marine National Park and Sanctuary. Therefore, permission under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act (""FCA"") was required for the entire 15.49 hectares. At the same time, permission of State Government was required under the Wildlife Protection Act (""WPA"") for 8.79 hectares.

17.On 13.02.1995, the State Government requested the Chief Conservator of Forests, Regional Office, Western Region, Bhopal, to move the Government of India to issue suitable orders to allow Essar to make geophysical survey in Marine National  Park/Sanctuary area. The proposal was forwarded by the Chief Conservator of Forests, Bhopal to the Government of India on 15.05.1995.

18.The Conservator of Forests recommended and forwarded the proposal of Essar for Right of Way to the Chief Conservator of Forests (WL) by letter dated 2nd June, 1995 along with an application in the prescribed form seeking prior approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of FCA. The application with its enclosures together with the recommendation of the State Government that 15.49 hectares of forest land be made available to the appellant, was forwarded to the Central Government by the Central Chief Conservator of Forests on 3rd February, 1997.

Upon receipt of the proposal of the State Government, the Central Government constituted a team for joint inspection of the area. The report of the joint inspection team was that the proposed activity of the appellant would not have much ramification from the forestry point of view and the  damage would only be temporary in nature in a localized area during the construction phase.

19.On 08.09.1995, the State Government in its Forests and Environment Department informed the Government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests, inter alia, that the approval ""in principle"" was granted to Essar to install Single Buoy Mooring / Crude Oil Terminal / Jetty and connecting pipeline in the National Marine Park and Sanctuary area in Vadinar, District Jamnagar on the terms and conditions to be decided in due course by the State Government.

20.On 11.09.1995 the said Scheme was announced and thereafter on 01.02.1996 Essar applied in the new format to the Industries Commissioner, Gandhinagar for registering the Industrial Undertaking as a ""Premier/Prestigious Unit"" under the said Scheme.

21.On 29.05.1996 the Forest and Environment Department, State of Gujarat made a proposal to Government of  India seeking approval under Section 2 of FCA for diversion of 15.49 hectares of forest land for construction and operation of certain offshore and onshore facilities for a grass root refinery project of Essar.

22.On the basis of the letter-dated 30.09.1997 of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, the State Government conveyed on 16.10.1997 its permission under section 29 of WPA to Essar's proposal of right to way through the National Park and Sanctuary subject to Essar's compliance with certain terms and conditions including obtaining permission of the Central Government under the FCA, 1980 (which was granted on 08.12.1999, mentioned later) and also getting clearance under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Regulations, which was granted on 03.11.2000.

23.This permission was conveyed to Essar by the Conservator of Forests under cover of his letter-

dated 18.10.1997. The permission was, however, restricted to the Kandla Port Trust area. Kandla  Port Trust granted permission to Essar to install ""marine facilities"" on 10.10.1997.

24.On 27.11.1997 the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India granted ""in-principle"" approval to Essar under FCA, 1980 for diverting 15.49 hectares of forest land for non-forest purpose.

25.On 25.06.1999 Essar was issued the provisional Premier Registration Certificate by the Industries Commissioner. The provisional certificate was valid upto 15.08.2000 i.e. the last date of Scheme, within this time period Essar was obliged to start commercial production, failing which Essar would have to apply for extension of date of commercial production.

26.In the meantime in view of the permissions granted to install ""marine facilities"", Essar started construction work of laying of water in-take jetty and product jetty in the forest area of Marine  National Park and Marine Sanctuary. Essar's grievances are that despite the aforesaid permissions being given to them for construction, the State Forest Department forced Essar to stop work and further lodged on 19.3.1999 a criminal complaint against Essar and its contractor, for offence committed under sections 17(A), 29, 35(6), 51(1) and 58 of the WPA and section 26 of the Indian Forests Act.

27.In April 1999, a writ petition being Special Civil Application No.2840/1999 in the nature of Public Interest Litigation was filed before the High Court of Gujarat by one Halar Utkarsh Samiti (hereinafter ""Samiti"") alleging serious violations of several environmental legislations on the part of Essar, who was impleaded as Respondent No.4 in the petition.

28.By interim order-dated 20.04.1999 passed in that PIL High Court directed Essar not to carry on any construction activity in the Marine National Sanctuary and Marine National Park in violation of  the statutory provisions including the provisions contained in Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972.

29.By order-dated 20.08.1999 the High Court disposed of the said PIL in which Essar undertook to file an Undertaking to the effect that they would not carry out any construction activities at the site in question, without obtaining the approval from the authorities. Pursuant to the said order, on 28.09.1999 Essar filed an undertaking to the following effect:

""...no construction activities or marine facilities will be undertaken without obtaining the approval from the authorities including those which are under process before the authorities.

This undertaking is given without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the Respondent No.4.

This undertaking will come to an end as and when the permission is granted by the authorities.""

30.In the meantime on 09.09.1999, a charge sheet was filed against the officers of Essar and its  contractor in respect of earlier mentioned offences allegedly committed by them under the WPA and FCA.

31.On 08.12.1999 the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India granted approval under section 2 of the FCA for the total land of 15.49 hectares of forest land.

32.In April 2000, said Samiti filed another PIL being Special Civil Application No.1778, and subsequently two other PILs were also filed by one Jan Sangarsh Manch and one Shri Alpesh Y. Kogje, being Civil Application Nos.5476 and 5928 of 2000, (hereinafter ""second PILs"") in the High Court of Gujarat challenging, inter alia, the permission granted by the State Government to one Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd. (`BORL') to lay pipeline in the Marine National Park and Sanctuary Area. It is pertinent to note here that Essar was not a party to these petitions.

33.On 29.04.2000 the Government of Gujarat discontinued the said Scheme with effect from 01.01.2000.

However, vide the same Government Resolution dated 29.04.2000, it was specifically mentioned that industry units in pipelines cases which have been registered should start production within two years from January 1, 2000 failing which such units shall be rendered ineligible for sales tax incentive.

Therefore, the time to start commercial production was thus extended to 01.01.2002. It is common ground that Essar, being a registered unit, was entitled to the benefit of the said extension.

34.Before the High Court, when proceedings in respect of the second PILs were going on, the counsel of Government of Gujarat placed a copy of the letter-

dated 25.07.2000. Relying on the letter, the High Court noted that there were two more pending proposals for laying pipeline in the Marine Park/Sanctuary Area with the State Government - one from Essar and the other from one Gujarat Poshitra Port Ltd.

35.Before the High Court, the State Government submitted that the proposal from Essar for laying down pipelines in Marine National Park and Marine Sanctuary, Vadinar in Jamnagar District has been only approved `in principle' vide letter-dated 08.09.1995. However, formal sanction under section 29 of the WPA, 1972 is yet to be given by the State Government.

36.By judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 the High Court, in the second PILs, restrained the Government of Gujarat from granting any more authorization and permission for laying down any pipeline in any part of the sanctuary or the national park. As a result of this order, Essar was not given permission to lay down pipelines by the State Government.

37.Being aggrieved, inter alia, on the ground that it was not a party to the second PILs, Essar filed a review/recall application before the High Court  being MCA No.250 of 2011 in SCA No.1778 of 2000, inter alia, seeking review and recall of the judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 passed in the second PILs by the High Court and a further declaration to the effect that Essar's project at Vadinar was not affected in any manner by the said judgment.

38.By judgment and order dated 23.02.2001 the High Court rejected the said application for review on the ground that there was a factual controversy between Essar and the State Government and that therefore the grievance of Essar was beyond the scope of review.

39.Meanwhile, on 12.04.2001 the Government of Gujarat extended the time for going into commercial production upto 15.08.2003 for various pipeline units including Essar, vide Government Resolution dated 12.04.2001. By that time Essar had obtained Provisional Premier Unit Registration before  15.08.2000 and had also incurred 25% of the Project Cost before 15.08.2000 and therefore, it was entitled to the benefit of this extension.

40.Essar challenged the aforesaid judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000, 03.08.2000 and 23.02.2001 of the High Court delivered in the second PILs and the rejection of its review petition in that second PILs respectively by way of filing Special Level Petition being (SLP) CC No.3654 of 2001 [later SLP No.9454-

9455 of 2001] before this Hon'ble Court.

41.By interim order-dated 11.05.2001 this Court granted stay of the judgment of the High Court in so far as Essar was concerned in SLP No.9454-9455 of 2001 i.e. SLP filed by Essar. The text of the order of this Court is set out:

""Permission to file Special Leave Petition is granted.

Issue notice.

Stay of the High Court judgment in so far as the petitioner is concerned.

Counter affidavit be filed within four weeks.

Rejoinder be filed within four weeks thereafter. List after eight weeks.""

42.In view of the above stay order granted by this Court, Essar moved the State Government for permitting it to proceed with the construction of jetty and laying the pipeline. By letter dated 29.10.2001, the State Government in the Forests and Environment Department specifically called Essar to ensure that no construction activities were commenced before obtaining all necessary clearances from different Government departments, agencies and the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India as well as the Forests and Environment Department of the State Government were strictly complied with.

However, Essar did not commence the construction of jetty or laying down the pipeline in the National Marine Park/Sanctuary area. One thing which is of some importance is that despite the stay of this Court and the Government letter dated 29.10.2001, Essar did not challenge the Government stand in the  pending special leave petition filed by it in this Court.

43. It is also pertinent to note that the Government of Gujarat had also challenged the judgment and order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 of the High Court passed in the second PILs by way of filing Special Leave Petition being (SLP) CC No.5123-5125 of 2001 (later SLP No.17694-96 of 2001) before this Court, wherein by interim order dated 24.09.2001 this Court passed the following operative order:

""Issue notice.

Tag with SLP(C) 9454-9455/2001.

There will be status quo as of today with the result that any permission which has been granted is not stayed. It will be open to the State Government to consider the granting of further permission which will be subject to the outcome of this appeal.""

44.Essar just requested by its letter dated 11.04.2002 the Industries Commissioner to extend the date of  commercial production to 30.11.2004 instead of 15.08.2003 for the purpose of availing the incentive benefit under the Scheme and cited that the delay in completing the project and consequent delay in starting commercial production was due to the factors beyond the control of Essar. Further by letter-dated 07.05.2002 Essar in continuation of the letter-dated 11.04.2002 requested the Industries Commissioner to extend the date of commercial production to August 2006.

45.The Industries Commissioner refused to grant any further extension of time vide its letter-dated 28.05.2002 and also made it clear to Essar to go into commercial production within the specified time i.e. till 15.08.2003. Essar, therefore, submitted a representation dated 19.06.2002 to the Chief Minister pointing out the circumstances which had delayed the completion of the project. Similar representations were thereafter made to different authorities of the State Government on 27.06.2002, 14.03.2003, 30.07.2003, 02.12.2003 and 26.12.2003.

It appears that the said representations were not responded to.

46.By an order-dated 19.01.2004, this Court quashed and set aside the judgment dated 03.08.2000 of High Court and directed the State Government to issue the authorization to Essar in the requisite format under Sections 29 and 35 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act within a fortnight after disapproving the interpretation placed by the High Court on the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

This Court took the view that the permission granted by the State Government on 16.10.1997 was the permission contemplated by Section 29 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

47. In compliance with the above judgment, by letter dated 12.02.2004, the State Government authorized the Chief Wild Life Warden, Gujarat State under Sections 29 and 35 (6) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act to permit Essar for laying oil pipeline in the  National Marine Park/Sanctuary area. The Chief Wild Life Warden also issued the requisite permission on 27.02.2004.

48. In the meantime, the accused i.e. officials and contractors of Essar involved in the Criminal Case of 1999 moved an application for discharge before the Metropolitan Magistrate at Khambalia. By order-

dated 27.05.2004 the Magistrate allowed the said application and discharged the accused persons from all the charges levelled against them.

49.In view of the above permission granted by the Chief Wild Life Warden under Sections 29 and 35 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, Essar again sent representations dated 06.04.2004, 12.07.2004, 27.07.2004 and 22.12.2004 to the Government requesting extension of time limit for commencement of commercial production for the purpose of sales tax deferment incentive scheme. In view of the above representations, the State Government in the Industries and Mines Department vide Resolution  dated 10.05.2006 constituted a Committee comprising of the Advisor to the Chief Minister, the then Additional Chief Secretary, Finance Department and the then Principal Secretary, Industries and Mines department. The Committee was constituted to consider various such representations of Essar and other Companies.

50.On 26.11.2006 Essar commenced commercial production and started paying sales tax on the products sold by it, under protest.

51.As nothing was heard from the said Committee constituted in the year 2006 and the representations made by Essar in respect of granting Sales Tax Deferment were undecided, Essar filed a writ petition being Special Civil Application No. 24233/2007 before the High Court contending that for no fault of it, Essar was prevented from completing the project and that it was on account of being so prevented, Essar  could not commence the commercial production within the time limit of 15.08.2003.

52.It is pertinent to note at this stage that before the High Court, Essar had expressly withdrawn the allegation that Department of Forest and Conservation, Government of Gujarat was guilty of delay. This is noted in para 6.2 of the High Court judgment which is set out below:

""6.2 While in the memo of the petition some allegations/submissions have been made attributing the delay to the Forests and Conservation Department of State Government, but the petitioner Company is not interested in pursuing those allegations and in fact would like to withdraw those allegations and the petitioner would like to invoke the following maxims of equity:-

(i) ""An act of the Court shall prejudice no man"", and

(ii) ""The law does not compel a man to do that which he cannot possibly perform.""

53. Before the High Court Essar contended that reason for delay in commencement of commercial production was on account of the injunction granted by the High Court on 13.07.2000/03.08.2000, restraining the  State from granting further permission under Section 29 of the WPA in the second PILs (where Essar was not a party). And this situation continued till 27.02.2004, when pursuant to the judgment-dated 19.01.2004 of this Court the Chief Warden granted the said permission. Therefore Essar was entitled to get benefit of the exclusion of the said intervening period of from 13.07.2000 to 27.02.2004 i.e. three years and 230 days in calculating the time limit for commencement of commercial production.

54. By impugned order-dated 22.04.2008 the High Court excluded the aforesaid intervening period and as such extended the time limit for commencement of commercial production from 15.08.2003 to 02.04.2007 after observing in the impugned judgment as under:

""17. ...In the facts of the present case also, the State Government had granted the permission on 16.10.1997 and the Central Government had granted the permission on 08.12.1999. The very fact that the Chief Wild Life Warden issued the permission on 27.02.2004 after the decision of the Apex Court on 19.01.2004 is itself sufficient to show that the request made by the  petitioner for excluding the intervening period between 13th July/3rd August, 2000 and 27.02.2004 is reasonable.""

55.It is also pertinent to note herein that in the impugned order, a direction was given to the State Government that while considering Essar's application for the incentives, the State Government shall stipulate the following conditions, provided the final eligibility certificate is issued within one month from the date of receipt of the judgment:-

""22. ...

(i) The petitioner shall not be given the benefit of deferment of Sales-tax/Value Added Tax beyond 14th August, 2020.

(ii) The amount of Sales-tax/VAT already paid/payable by the petitioner for the period upto today shall not be refunded to the petitioner.

(The above amount is stated by the petitioner company to be above Rs.300 crores)

(iii) Without adjusting the Sales-tax/VAT paid for the period upto today as aforesaid, the amount otherwise computable under the Incentive Scheme on the basis of the eligible capital investment made by the petitioner in  the unit under consideration shall be reduced by Rs.700 crores.""

56. The above direction is based on the submissions of the counsel of both the parties, which were made without prejudice to their respective cases. The counsel of Essar submitted a proposal that Essar was ready to make the above mentioned concessions no.

(i) & (ii) if the State Government does not challenge the decision of the High Court and within one month from that day the State Government grants Essar the benefit of the Sales Tax/VAT deferment as per the said scheme. In response to the said proposal the learned counsel for the State Government replied that assuming that Essar was found to be eligible under the said Scheme, the amount otherwise computable under the Incentive Scheme on the basis of the eligible capital investment made by Essar in the unit under consideration shall be reduced by Rs.700 crores.

57.The learned counsel for the respondents made an attempt to urge that the judgment of the High Court  was virtually rendered by way of a concession and the impugned judgment is a consent order. As such the appeal, at the instance of the State, is not maintainable. Learned counsel for the State strongly opposed this contention and submitted that the same contention was raised at the time of admission of the special leave petition. Then, further affidavit was filed by the State with the leave of the Court.

The Court was satisfied and then issued notice.

58. Ultimately, the matter was argued on merits before this Court and it was common ground that the impugned judgment is not by consent.

59.The impugned judgment of the High Court is based on two basic line of reasoning that the respondents are entitled to the benefit of Sales Tax Waiver Scheme firstly on the principle of restitution and secondly, that the respondents cannot be made to lose the benefit under the Sales Tax Waiver Scheme, for an act of Court. In this regard it has been urged that the respondents could not set up the  plant for the purpose of commercial production within 15th August, 2003 as it was prevented from doing so by an order of injunction of the High Court. An order of injunction is an act of Court and an act of High Court cannot prejudice anyone. The loss of time suffered by the respondent as a result of the injunction order cannot cause any prejudice to the respondent.

60.Examining the aforesaid two contentions, this Court finds that there is an overlapping area between the two. The concept of restitution is basically founded on the idea that when a decree is reversed, law imposes an obligation on the party who received an unjust benefit of the erroneous decree to restitute the other party for what the other party has lost during the period the erroneous decree was in operation. Therefore, the Court while granting restitution is required to restore the parties as far as possible to their same position as they were in at the time when the Court by its erroneous action displaced them. In the case of Lal Bhagwant  Singh v. Sri Kishen Das reported in AIR 1953 SC 136, Justice Mahajan speaking for a unanimous three-Judge Bench of this Court explained the doctrine of restitution in the following words:-

""...the principles of the doctrine of restitution which is that on the reversal of a judgment the law raises an obligation on the party to the record who received the benefit of the erroneous judgment to make restitution to the other party for what he had lost and that it is the duty of the Court to enforce that obligation unless it is shown that restitution would be clearly contrary to the real justice of the case...""

61.Subsequently, in Binayak Swain v. Ramesh Chandra Panigrahi and another (AIR 1966 SC 948) this Court relied on the principles in Bhagwant Singh (supra) and explained the concept of restitution as follows:-

""...The principle of the doctrine of restitution is that on the reversal of a decree, the law imposes an obligation on the party to the suit who received the benefit of the erroneous decree to make restitution to the other party for what he has lost.""

62.The concept of restitution is virtually a common law principle and it is a remedy against unjust  enrichment or unjust benefit. The core of the concept lies in the conscience of the Court which prevents a party from retaining money or some benefit derived from another which he has received by way of an erroneous decree of Court. Such remedy in English Law is generally different from a remedy in contract or in tort and falls within a third category of common law remedy which is called quasi contract or restitution.

63.If we analyze the concept of restitution one thing emerges clearly that the obligation to restitute lies on the person or the authority that has received unjust enrichment or unjust benefit (See Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Volume 9, page 434).

64.If we look at Restatement of the Law of Restitution by American Law Institute (1937 American Law Institute Publishers, St. Paul) we get that a person is enriched if he has received a benefit and similarly a person is unjustly enriched if the  retention of the benefit would be unjust. Now the question is what constitutes a benefit. A person confers benefit upon another if he gives to the other possession of or some other interest in money, land, chattels, or performs services beneficial to or at the request of the other, satisfies a debt or a duty of the other or in a way adds to the other's security or advantage. He confers a benefit not only where he adds to the property of another but also where he saves the other from expense or loss. Thus the word ""benefit"" therefore denotes any form of advantage (page 12 of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution by American Law Institute).

65.Ordinarily in cases of restitution if there is a benefit to one, there is a corresponding loss to other and in such cases; the benefiting party is also under a duty to give to the losing party, the amount by which he has been enriched.

66.We find that a person who has conferred a benefit upon another in compliance with a judgment or whose  property has been taken thereunder, is entitled to restitution if the judgment is reversed or set-

aside, unless restitution would be inequitable (page 302 of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution by American Law Institute).

67.Equity demands that if one party has not been unjustly enriched, no order of recovery can be made against that party. Other situation would be when a party acquires benefits lawfully, which are not conferred by the party claiming restitution, Court cannot order restitution.

68. From the facts of the case which has been discussed above it is debatable whether the respondent's inability to avail benefit under the said Scheme is because of its own act or because of the act of the appellant. There is a reasonable basis in the argument of the appellant that after this Court granted the stay order on 11.5.2001 on the special leave petition filed by Essar, the respondents should have made an effort of obtaining the  necessary licence by again coming to the Court.

Admittedly Essar did not do it. Essar merely represented to the State for grant of licence.

Assuming that the State had not responded favourably to the representation of Essar by giving the clearance, it was open to Essar to approach this Court for some order as its special leave petition was pending before this Court. Essar did not do it.

Therefore, the question remains whether Essar acted with due diligence in obtaining the equitable remedy of restitution. It is well known that due diligence must be exhibited by the party to seek equity.

69.Now, if we take the case of Essar on a higher plain that it has done its duty even then it has been denied of the benefit of the said scheme, even then there is no question of restitution by the State for the simple reason that it is nobody's case that State has received any unjust benefit or any unjust enrichment in view of stay order given by the High Court in the second PILs filed in the High Court. On the contrary, it is clear from the record that the  State contested those proceedings and specially, challenging the orders of the Gujarat High Court dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 on the second PILs, the State has filed its SLP. Therefore, the State has not at all gained or received any benefit as a result of the orders passed by the High Court on the second PILs.

Therefore, the principle of restitution cannot be applied against the State, the appellant before us.

The judgment of the High Court to that extent is erroneous.

70.The second principle that an act of court cannot prejudice anyone, based on latin maxim ""actus curiae neminem gravabit"" is also encompassed partly within the doctrine of restitution. This actus curiae principle is founded upon justice and good sense and is a guide for the administration of law.

71.The aforesaid principle of ""actus curiae"" was applied in the case of A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak & another reported in (1988) 2 SCC 602, wherein  Sabyasachi Mukharji, J (as his lordship then was) giving the majority judgment for the Constitution Bench of this Court, explained its concept and application in para 83, page 672 of the report. His lordship quoted the observation of Lord Cairns in Rodger v. Comptoir D'escompte De Paris, [(1869-71) LR 3 PC 465 at page 475) which is set out below:

""Now, their Lordships are of opinion, that one of the first and highest duties of all Courts is to take care that the act of the Court does no injury to any of the Suitors, and when the expression 'the act of the Court' is used, it does not mean merely the act of the Primary Court, or of any intermediate Court of appeal, but the act of the Court as a whole, from the lowest Court which entertains jurisdiction over the matter up to the highest Court which finally disposes of the case. It is the duty of the aggregate of those Tribunals, if I may use the expression, to take care that no act of the Court in the course of the whole of the proceedings does an injury to the suitors in the Court.""
72.In the Antulay case (supra), it was found that directions of this Court in its order-dated 16.02.1984 in the previous Antulay Case {R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antuley, (1984) 2 SCC 183} was given per incuriam and without noticing the provisions of section 6 and 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 and also the binding nature of the Larger Bench decision in The State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar & another (AIR 1952 SC 75).

73.It was made clear in the Antulay Case [(1988) 2 SCC 602] that when Court passes an order, which is rendered per incuriam, and the party suffered because of the mistake of the Court, it is the Court's duty to rectify the said mistake. It is in that context that the concept of actus curiae can be invoked. In the instant case the order passed by the High Court in the second PILs was overturned by this Court by its order-dated 19.01.2004 on a different interpretation of section 29 of the WPA.

74.This Court while giving a different interpretation of section 29 of WPA never held that High Court acted per incuriam in rendering its judgment on second PIL filed by the Samiti. Therefore in the case of a mere erroneous judgment of a Court the principle of ""actus curiae"" cannot be invoked.

75.The learned counsel for Essar in support of the applicability of Doctrine of Restitution has cited the case of South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. v. State of M.P. & others reported in (2003) 8 SCC 648 wherein this Court through R.C. Lahoti, J (as his Lordship then was) in para 27 had observed that:

""Section 144 C.P.C. is not the fountain source of restitution, it is rather a statutory recognition of a pre-existing rule of justice, equity and fair play. That is why it is often held that even away from Section 144 the Court has inherent jurisdiction to order restitution so as to do complete justice between the parties.""

76.His Lordship at para 28 observed as under:

""That no one shall suffer by an act of the court is not a rule confined to an erroneous act of the court; the 'act of the court' embraces within its sweep all such acts as to which the court may form an opinion in any legal proceedings that the court would not have so acted had it been correctly apprised of the facts and the law. The factor attracting applicability of restitution is not the act of the Court being wrongful or a mistake or error committed by the Court; the test is whether on account of an act of the party persuading the Court to pass an order held at the end as not sustainable, has resulted in one party gaining  an advantage which it would not have otherwise earned, or the other party has suffered an impoverishment which it would not have suffered but for the order of the Court and the act of such party. The quantum of restitution, depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case, may take into consideration not only what the party excluded would have made but also what the party under obligation has or might reasonably have made.""
77.As discussed earlier a mere mistake or error committed by Court cannot be a ground for restitution. Now in view of the above, two questions arise for consideration:

(i) Whether the orders dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 of the High Court whereby the appellant was restrained from giving any further permission for laying pipelines has resulted in any undue advantage to appellant?

(ii) Whether in respect of the order dated 13.07.2000, 18.07.2000, 20.07.2000, 27.07.2000 and 03.08.2000 of the High Court, later on reversed by this Court on 19.01.2004 on a different  interpretation of Section 29 of WPA, the actus curiae principle can be invoked.

78.Coming to the first question, as mentioned above, it is clear that the appellant had also challenged this restraining order before this Court. It cannot be said by this restraining order the appellant had gained any undue advantage. On the contrary, twin objects of development of the backward areas and employment opportunities, which were sought to be achieved by the appellant by floating the said scheme, were adversely affected.

79.Therefore the principles in South Eastern Coalfield Ltd. (supra) are not attracted here.

80.In Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd v. Golden Chariot Airport & another, (2010) 10 SCC 422, after a Civil Court returned the plaint filed by respondent, the respondent came up in appeal against the said order before the High Court and expressly gave up its claim of irrevocable license in order to  revive the suit and on such stand, the High Court remanded the suit for trial. Thereafter the respondent therein tried to urge the same plea of irrevocable license before the Trial Court and this Court. This Court did not accept the plea holding that the common law doctrine of approbation and reprobation is well established in our jurisprudence and applicable in our laws too. That principle has no application to the facts of this case.

81.The principles decided in the case of Karnataka Rare Earth & Anr. v. Senior Geologist, Department of Mines & Geology and Anr.

, reported in (2004) 2 SCC 783 is equally of no assistance to Essar. In that case both the doctrines of ""actus curiae"" and ""restitution"" were discussed together. We have already held that these equitable doctrines are not applicable in the facts of the present case. In Karnataka Rare Earth (supra), the appellants, on the basis of an interim order granted by this Court, extracted minerals and disposed of the same.

Ultimately the interim order was vacated by this  Court and the appeal filed by Karnataka Rare Earth was dismissed. In that context this Court held that the appellants cannot enjoy the benefits earned by them under the interim order of this Court and this Court held that the demand of the State for the price of mines and minerals from the appellant is neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.

82.Reliance was placed on the judgment of this Court in Bareilly Development Authority v. Methodist Church of India & Anr., reported in (1988) Supp SCC 174. In that case no principle was decided but the case was decided on its facts. In Bareilly Development Authority (supra), a commercial complex was to be constructed within a time schedule. During the said period of construction, the work had to be stopped in view of the demolition order passed by the authority. This Court held that the said period has to be excluded in computing the period of completion. It was not a case of construing any exemption scheme. What was construed was condition 6 of the construction sanction plan. Therefore  principles of Bareilly Development Authority (supra) cannot be applied.

83.In the case of Hitech Electrothermics & Hydro Power Ltd. v. State of Kerala & Ors., reported in (2003) 2 SCC 716 it is true that this case is one relating to grant of concessional tariff rate. However the fact shows that in that case the Electricity Board provided power to the appellant only in the year 1998 and the Court found that the delay in giving power was for sheer inaction on the part of Electricity Board. In that context this Court held that literal construction to the entitlement of concessional tariff rate should not be done and the Court also noted that the appellant enjoyed concessional tariff rates on the basis of interim order of Court.

84.In the instant case, no inaction on the part of appellant was pleaded by Essar. In fact before the High Court, Essar expressly gave up its plea of delay against the appellant. In fact the High Court  passed the injunction order not because of the inaction of the appellant but the said order was passed in a proceedings which was opposed by appellant right upto this Court. Therefore, the case of Hitech Electrothermics (supra) is clearly distinguishable on facts.

85.The learned counsel for Essar relied on a decision of this Court in Ishwar Dutt v. Land Acquisition Collector & another reported in (2005) 7 SCC 190.

But no question of issue estoppel was argued before the High Court and no such question actually has fallen for consideration in the course of argument before this Court. Therefore reliance on the principle of issue estoppel on the basis of Ishawar Dutt (supra) is not relevant at all.

86.In this case we are to interpret the provisions of exemption scheme.

87.In Novopan India Ltd. Hyderabad v. Collector of Central Exercise and Customs, Hyderabad [(1994) Supp  3 SCC 606] the question for consideration before this Court was that, in case of ambiguity, which rule of construction will be applicable to exemption provision. This Court relied on the case of Union of India & others v. Wood Papers Ltd & another reported in (1990) 4 SCC 256, wherein at para 4, page 260 this Court observed as under:

""...Truly speaking liberal and strict construction of an exemption provision are to be invoked at different stages of interpreting it. When the question is whether a subject falls in the notification or in the exemption clause then it being in nature of exception is to be construed strictly and against the subject but once ambiguity or doubt about applicability is lifted and the subject falls in the notification then full play should be given to it and it calls for a wider and liberal construction.""
88.This Court held that the principle that in case of ambiguity, a taxing statute should be construed in favour of the assessee, does not apply to the construction of an exception or an exempting provision, as the same have to be construed strictly. Further this Court also held that a person  invoking an exception or an exemption provision to relieve him of the tax liability must establish clearly that he is covered by the said provision and in case of doubt or ambiguity, benefit of it must go to the State.

89.In this case, Essar was categorically told by letter dated 28.05.2002, which is much prior to the expiry of the period, that time for availing the exemption cannot be extended. Admittedly, Essar failed to meet the deadline. In that factual scenario, the exercise undertaken by the High Court in the impugned judgment by directing various adjustments which virtually re-wrote the State's exemption scheme, is an exercise which is, with great respect, neither warranted in law nor supported by precedents. There is no question of equity here, an exemption is a stand alone process. Either an industry claiming exemption comes within it or it does not.

90.For the reasons aforesaid we allow the appeal. The High Court judgment is set aside.

91.The parties are left to bear their own costs.",1,
Margret Almeida & Ors. Etc Etc.,"CHELAMESWAR, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. These appeals arise out of a common order dated 29th August, 2011 of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court passed in three writ petitions and two suits, 144 and 145 of 2010.

3. By the said common order, it was held, among other things, that the two suits are not maintainable in view of the provisions of Sections 91 and 163 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 (hereinafter `the Act', for short). We are not concerned with the remaining part of the Division Bench's judgment as the instant special leave petitions are preferred only against that part of the Division Bench's judgment. The brief factual background of this litigation is as follows.

4. The first respondent is a Society which was originally incorporated in the year 1914. The full particulars of such incorporation are not available at this juncture on record and are also not necessary for the present purpose. It is sufficient to state that it is admitted on all hands that it is a housing cooperative society and the Act governs the affairs of the said Society.

5. It is also an admitted fact on all hands that the said Society has different classes of members known as owners, lessees, allottees, tenants, etc. It is also an admitted fact that the total membership is 762 out of which 69 members fall under the classification of tenant members. However, the exact rights and obligations of these various classes of members, vis-`-vis the first respondent Society or these various classes of members inter se are also not available on record.

6. It appears from the record that, as on today, the first respondent Society owns an extent of approximately 21,774.10 sq. mts. of land in the city of Mumbai alongwith structures popularly known as Wellingdon Catholic Colony. It appears that the said property was part of a larger parcel of land earlier owned by the first respondent Society but is not owned by the Society now.

Some of the `tenant members' (including the appellants herein) of the Society initiated proceedings for the division of the Society sometime in the year 1970 invoking Section 18 of the Act by making an application to the Registrar. The said application has a very long and chequered history, the details of which are not necessary for the present purpose except to state that by virtue of the judgment under appeal, the application is still open and pending.

7. In the meanwhile, in a resolution came to be passed on the 6th December, 2009 by the General Body of the Society to sell the above mentioned land in favour of respondents No.22 and 23. In furtherance of the said resolution, a sale deed/conveyance came to be executed on 7th December, 2009. Aggrieved by the said resolution and the sale, two suits 144 and 145/2010 came to be filed invoking the original jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court. A  copy of the plaint in the suit No.145/2010 is placed on record in these SLPs. The principal prayer in both the civil suits is ""(a) for a declaration that the said Resolution dated 6th December, 2009 (Exhibit `K' hereto) and the said Conveyance dated 7th December, 2009 (Exhibit `M' hereto) are invalid, illegal and void ab initio and/or the same are voidable as against the Plaintiffs and the Tenant members of Defendant No.17 Association;

(a-i) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass Order declaring Section 164 of Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 12 Violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and the same ought to be struck down.""

It can be seen from prayer (a) extracted above that the plaintiffs seek in effect two declarations - (i) that a resolution dated 6th November, 2009 of the first respondent Society, and (ii) a Conveyance dated 7th December, 2009 executed on behalf of the first respondent Society in favour of respondents 22 and 23, are either illegal, void ab initio or in the alternative that they are voidable as against the plaintiffs (of whom at least some) are the appellants herein and claim to be the tenant members of the respondent society (we may state here that there is a dispute regarding the membership of some of the appellants herein but, for the present case, we do not go into the dispute but refer the appellants, only for the sake of convenience, as `tenant members').

The substance of the factual and legal basis (asserted in the plaint) on which the plaintiffs seek the two declarations (referred to earlier) in the civil suits, and argued at the Bar is that the `tenant members' alone have the right, title and interest over the property sought to  be sold by the impugned conveyance dated 7th December, 2009 and that the other members of the Society have no right, title or interest in the property in dispute. The plaintiffs expect an order of bifurcation of the respondent No.1 Society and also to get a declaration in their favour of the right, title and interest in the property in dispute. The plaintiffs also therefore claimed appropriate interim orders regarding the property during the pendency of the suits.

8. The defendants raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the suits in view of Sections 91 and 163 of the Act which was rejected by a learned single judge but found favour with the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court resulting in that part of the judgment which is under appeal now.

9. By the judgment under appeal it is held that:

""In our opinion, therefore, what is principally challenged in the Civil Suit is the resolution of the general body. And challenge to the conveyance is ancillary""
And therefore opined:

""That the Plaintiffs could have filed the dispute before the Co-operative Court challenging the resolution of the General Body and the consequent execution of conveyance in favour of M/s. Sumer associates and could have joined M/s. Sumer associates as a Defendant in that dispute. In our opinion thus the entire subject matter of the Civil Suit could have been the subject matter of the dispute filed under Section 91.""
10. Shri Mukul Rohtagi and Dr. Abhishek M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants argued that irrespective of the fact whether a declaration regarding illegality of the impugned resolution dated 6th December, 2009 could be granted by the ordinary civil courts in view of Section 91 of the Act, a declaration regarding the voidness of the impugned conveyance dated 7th December, 2009 could only be given by a competent civil court contemplated under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter `the Code' for short) because such conveyance is in favour of a person who is not a member of the Society. It is submitted that the ultimate dispute and grievance of the plaintiffs is against the alienation of the property in favour of the respondents 22 and 23 herein by the impugned conveyance which has the effect of depriving the plaintiffs of their right, title and interest in the property in dispute. Such a conveyance could only be declared illegal and void ab initio by a competent civil court contemplated under Section 9 of the Code. The impugned resolution, which purportedly authorises the sale of the property covered by the impugned conveyance, by itself does not transfer or create any interest in the property adverse to the interest of the plaintiffs.

Therefore, even if it is assumed that the legality of the impugned resolution is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court functioning under Section 91, the suits in question could not have been held to be not maintainable as the jurisdiction to adjudicate  upon the incidental question regarding the impugned resolution dated 6th December, 2009 would stand subsumed by the jurisdiction of the competent civil court which alone is competent to decide the legality of the impugned conveyance dated 7th December, 2009. The learned counsel further argued that the ouster of the jurisdiction conferred on the Civil Courts under Section 9 of the Code is to be conceded only where there is an express exclusion by the language of the Statute or if such an ouster arises by a necessary implication from the Scheme of a particular Statute. It is argued that there is nothing either in the language of Section 91 or the Scheme of the Act which would lead to a conclusion that the jurisdiction conferred under Section 9 of the Code is excluded to adjudicate the suits in question.

11. On the question of interim order during the pendency of the suits, the learned counsel argued that in view of the pendency of the claim of the plaintiff for the bifurcation of the respondent society (and according to the appellants, they have a very strong case), the disputed property must be preserved as it is and the balance of convenience is in favour of the appellants. The learned counsel argued that the High Court grossly erred in examining the maintainability of the suits in the interlocutory application filed by the plaintiff seeking interim order.

12. On the other hand, learned senior counsel Shri C.A.

Sundaram appearing for the respondents argued that the language of Section 91, sub-section 1(c) of the Act clearly indicates that the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court contemplated under Section 91 is not confined only to the adjudication of the disputes between the society and its members or servants etc. enumerated in Section 91(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e) but also extends to the disputes where one of the parties to the dispute is a person other than a member of the society.

13. According to the learned counsel, such conclusion is irresistible from the language of Section 91(1) (c) and Section 94 (3) (a).Hence, the judgment under appeal does not call for any interference.

14. Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel submitted that the course adopted by the Bombay High Court in examining the maintainability of the suits in the Interlocutory Application filed by the plaintiffs is not only justified but also mandatory in view of the language of Section 9A of the Civil Procedure Code inserted by the State Legislation of Maharashtra.

15. On the question of interim arrangement to be made during the pendency of the suit, learned counsel for the respondent  submitted that the suit itself is based on the expectancy that the tenant Members would succeed in their application for the bifurcation of the society, and upon bifurcation, the tenant members would be entitled for the exclusive title and possession of the disputed property. Even if the above mentioned understanding of the plaintiff's is right since the plaintiffs are only some of the tenant members of the society, they would not be entitled for the title and possession of the entire disputed property, but only a part of it. It is argued that since other tenant members have no objection to the alienation of the property in dispute in favour of the respondent no.

22 and 23, impeding of conveyance dated 7th December, 2009 would not be justified as the impugned resolution and the conveyance have made adequate provisions for safeguarding the interest (if any) of the appellants.

16. We shall now examine the issue of maintainability of the suits.

As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants the Civil Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate Civil disputes is unlimited, subject only to the limitations imposed by law either expressly or by necessary implications. The law in this regard is well settled and needs no elaboration. Therefore, it becomes necessary for us to examine whether there is anything in the language of Section 91 or Section 163 which expressly excludes the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts in the context of the suits in question. Section 163 of the  Act bars the jurisdiction of Civil and Revenue Courts reads as follows:

""163. Bar of jurisdiction of Courts.
(1) Save as expressly provided in this Act, no Civil or Revenue Court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of
(a) the registration of a society or its by-laws or the amendments of its by-laws or the dissolution of the committee of a society, or the management of the society on dissolution thereof: or
(b) any dispute required to be referred to the Co- operative Court for decision.
(c) any matter concerned with the winding up and dissolution of a society.
(2) while a society is being wound up, no suit or other legal proceeding relating to the business of such society shall be proceeded with or instituted against the society or any member thereof, or any matter touching the affairs of the society, except by the leave of the Registrar, and subject to such terms as he may impose.
(3) all orders, decisions or awards passed in accordance with the Act or the Rules shall, subject to the provisions for appeal or revision in this Act be final; and no such order, decision or award shall be liable to be challenged, set aside, modified, revised or declared void in any Court upon the merits or upon any other ground whatsoever.""
17. Section 163 (1)(b) and Section 91 (3) are complimentary to each other. Section 91(3) reads as follows:

""Save as otherwise provided under ""sub-section (2) to section 93, no Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or other proceedings in respect of any dispute referred to in sub-section (1)""
18. It can be seen that the Section 163 only excludes the jurisdiction of the Civil Court with reference to the disputes arising out of the registration:-

1)     Registration of the society;


2)     Disputes relating to the bye-laws of the society; 


3)     Dissolution of the Committee of the society;


4)     Management of the society on dissolution of the society;


5)     Any   disputes   which   is   required   to   be   referred   to   the   Co-

       operative Court under Section 91.;


6)     Any matter concerned with the winding up and dissolution 

       of the society etc.





19. A dispute arising out of a decision of the society to alienate the property of the society, in our opinion, is not expressly covered under Section 163 of the Act. It is to be examined whether it is a matter which is required to be resolved by the Co-operative Court by virtue of the provisions under Section 91 of the Act. In view of the conclusion of the High Court that ""the entire subject matter of the civil suit could have been the subject matter of dispute filed under Section 91.""

20. It is necessary to examine the scope of Section 91(1), which reads as follows ""(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force any dispute touching the Constitution, (Election of Committee or its Officers) other than the elections of the committees of the specified  societies including its officers), Conduct of general meetings, management or business or a society shall be referred by any of the parties to the disputes, or by federal society to which the society is affiliated or by a creditor of the society, ( in the Co-operative Court) If both the parties there to are one or other of the following;-

(a) a society, its committee, any past committee, any past or present officer, any past or present agent, any past and present servant or nominee, heir or legal representative of any deceased officer, deceased agent or deceased servant of the society or the liquidator of the society (or the official Assignee of a De-Registered Society),

(b) a member, past member of a person claiming through a member, past member of a deceased member of society, or a society which is a member of the society ( or a persons who claims to be a member of the society;)

(c) a person other than a member of the society, with whom the society has any transactions in respect of which any restrictions or regulations have been imposed, made or prescribed under sections 43,44 or 45 and any person claiming through such person:

(d) a surety of a member, past member or deceased member, or surety of a person other than a member with whom the society has any transactions in respect of which restrictions have been prescribed under section 45, whether such surety or person is or is not a member of the society:

(e) any other society , or the Liquidator of such a society or de-registered society or the official Assignee of such a de-registered society.""

21. It can be seen from the above extract that the Section makes it mandatory that certain disputes, the nature of which is specified  in the said sub-section, be referred to the `Co-operative Court'1 - as defined under Section 2(10-a ii). Such reference is required to be made by ""any of the parties to the dispute"". The Section also specifies the nature/subject matter of dispute which is required to be referred to the Co-operative Courts. They are ""disputes touching"" the

1) Constitution of the society

2) Elections of the ""Committee or its officers""

       3)        Conduct General Meetings

       4)        Management of the society or

       5)        Business of the society.




22. Section 91 also stipulates that the disputes which are mandatorily required to referred to the Co-operative Court for an adjudication must also be disputes arising between the parties to the dispute who should belong to one or the other categories specified under clauses (a) to (e) to sub-section (1), hereinafter referred to as `enumerated persons', for the sake of convenience. It can be seen from the scheme of Section 91, to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Co-operative Court, the dispute must satisfy two requirements. It was held so in Marine Times Publications (P) Ltd.

Vs. Shriram Transport & Finance Co. Ltd., (1991) 1 SCC 469 at para 11:

""11. Before a dispute can be referred to a Cooperative Court under the provisions of Section 91(1) of the said Act it is not only essential that the dispute should be of a kind 1 `Co-operative Court' means a court constituted under this Act to decide disputes referred to it under any of the provisions of the Act.
described in sub-section (1) of Section 91 but it is also essential that the parties to the said dispute must belong to any of the categories specified in clauses (a) to (e) of sub- section (1) of the said section.""
Both the subject matter as well as the parties to the dispute must be those specified under the section. In other words if either of the above mentioned two requirements is not satisfied then the dispute cannot be adjudicated by the Co-operative Court. If one of the parties to the dispute is not an enumerated person, the question whether the subject matter of the dispute is one which falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court need not be examined. Similarly, if it is found in a given case that the subject matter of dispute is not covered by Section 91, an enquiry into the question whether the parties to the dispute fall under any of the categories enumerated under Section 91 would become irrelevant.

23. However, learned counsel for the respondent argued that in view of the language of Section 91(1) (c) and Section 94(3) the various classes of persons contemplated under Section 91 to bring the dispute within the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court (if the subject matter of the dispute is otherwise exclusively amenable to the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court), includes persons other than the members of the society though not covered by clauses (a),

(b), (d) and (e) of Section 91(1). The leaned counsel laid emphasis  on the clause ""persons other than a member of the society""

occurring under Section 91(1) (c) and the clause ""whether he be a member of the society or not has acquired any interest in the property of a person who is a party to a dispute"" occurring under Section 94(3)(a) clearly demonstrate that the jurisdiction of the Co-

operative Court is not confined only to those cases where both the parties are either members or officers etc. specified in clauses (a),

(b), (d) and (e) of Section 91(1).

24. To examine the correctness of the submissions made by Shri C.A. Sundaram, it requires an analysis of Section 91(1)(c) and 94 (3). When Section 91(1)(c) stipulates that persons other than the members of the society with whom the society has any transaction as one of the classes of persons who could be parties to a dispute amenable exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court, such a class is not an unqualified class. The said sub-section further qualifies the said class by expressly mentioning that the transactions of such persons with a society should be a transactions ""in respect of which restrictions and Regulations have been made or prescribed under Sections 43, 44, or 45 of the Act"". Therefore, to understand the exact nature of the above mentioned class, an examination of the scheme of Sections 43, 44 is necessary.

25. Section 43 (1) reads as follows:

""43. (1) A society shall receive deposits and loans from members and other persons, only to such extent, and under such conditions, as may be prescribed, or specified by the by-laws of the society.""
The said provision recognises the legal authority of a co-operative society to receive deposits and loans either from the members or other persons. It further stipulates that the receipt of deposits and loans is permissible only to the extent and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.

26. Section 44 on the other hand deals with the legal authority of the co-operative society to make a loan/lend money. Section 44 in so far as it is relevant reads as follows.

""44.(1) No society shall make a loan to any person other than a member or on the security of its own shares, or on the security of any person who is not a member.
Provided that with the special sanction of the Registrar, a society may make loans to another society. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-section, a society may make a loan to a depositor on the security of his deposit.
(3) ***************************""
It can be seen from sub-section (1) that it prohibits a society from lending money to a person other than a member. It also prohibits lending of money by the society even to a member on the security of the shares of the same society. Further it also prohibits lending of money to a member on security to a person who is not a  member. However, the proviso to sub-section (1) authorises a society to lend money to any other society with the special sanction of the Registrar.

27. Sub-section (2) expressly authorises the society to lend money to a depositor on the security of his deposits. Such an authorisation is declared to be notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1). In other words, the restriction contained in sub-

section (1) that a society shall not lend money to a person other than a member is relaxed with reference to a depositor, who is not a member of the society, as we have already noticed under Section 43 that the deposits or loans can be received by a society not only from its members but also from persons other than members.

28. Section 45 makes a general declaration that the transactions of the society with persons other than its members shall be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed. Section 45 reads as follows:-

""45. Save as is provided in this Act, the transactions of a society with persons other than members shall be subject to such restrictions, if any, as may be prescribed.""
29. Therefore, where Section 91 (1) (c) speaks of persons other than the members of the society, it is actually referring to persons other than the members of the society who have deposited money  with the society or who have either lent or borrowed money from the society in accordance with the provisions of Sections 43 and 44 and subject to the conditions and limitations if any prescribed with reference to such lending to or borrowing from the society.

30. Coming to the language and Scheme of Section 94(3).

Section 94(1) enumerates the powers of the Cooperative Court such as the power of summoning the witness and documents etc. Sub-

section (3)(a) reads as follows:

94. Procedure for settlement of disputes and power of Co-operative Court xxx xxx xxx xxx (3)(a) If the Co-operative Court is satisfied that a person whether he be a member of the society or not has acquired any interest in the property of a person who is a party to a dispute it may order that the person who has acquired the interest in the property may join as a party to the dispute; and any decision that may be passed on the reference by the Co-operative Court shall be binding on the party so joined in the same manner as if he were an original party to the dispute.""
[emphasis supplied] The substance of sub-section (3)(a) is that if the Co-operative Court in the course of adjudication of a dispute is satisfied that any person other than a party to the dispute ""has acquired any interest in the property of a party to a dispute"", then the Co-operative Court is empowered to implead such a 3rd party as a party to the dispute.
Such a 3rd party may or may not even be a member of the society.

The sub-section further declares such an impleaded 3rd party to be bound by the decision of the Co-operative Court.

31. It is argued by Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel for the respondents that the scheme and language of Section 94(3)(a) makes it beyond doubt that the Co-operative Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute is not confined only to the disputes between the various classes of persons enumerated under Section 91 alone but extends to others also if such a 3rd party (even in a case where he happen to be a non-member) acquires some interest in the property of either the society or the members or any other person enumerated in Section 91.

32. We find it difficult to accept the submissions of Shri Sundaram for the reason if really the Legislature intended that the Co-

operative Court should have jurisdiction in all the disputes irrespective of the nature of the dispute arising between the various classes of persons enumerated in Section 91 and non-member 3rd parties who acquire any interest in the property of such enumerated persons, the Legislature could have clearly indicated the same in Section 91 itself. It must be remembered that Section 94(3)(a) does not enable a person other than an enumerated person to refer a dispute to the Co-operative Court. The said legal position is made clear in Marine Times (supra). It was a case where a member  of a housing society occupying a part of the building owned by the society agreed to sell that property to a 3rd party subject to the approval of the society. The society declined approval. The 3rd party raised a dispute against the society as well as the member before the Co-operative Court. Dealing with the question whether the Co-operative Court would have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute, this Court answered the question in the negative.

33. Accepting the submission of Shri Sundaram would lead to a situation that while on one hand it is the settled position of law that the Act does not permit a person other than the one enumerated under Section 91 to seek adjudication of his dispute with `enumerated persons' in a Co-operative Court, such a Court would be authorised by virtue of Section 94(3)(a) to adjudicate a dispute between an enumerated person and a non-member 3rd party, if raised by an enumerated person. On the other hand, from the language of the said sub-section, it appears that the only circumstance which enables the Co-operative Court to exercise its jurisdiction against such a 3rd party is that while adjudicating a dispute which is otherwise amenable to its jurisdiction, the Co-

operative Court reaches the conclusion that a 3rd party acquired some interest in the property of one of the parties to the dispute.

Necessarily the following two questions must be examined to understand the exact scope of the said sub-section. (1) Whether the  property referred to in the sub-section is any property of one of the parties to the dispute or should such property bear any relationship to the dispute? (2) Whether the acquisition of the interest referred to should be anterior to the reference of the dispute to the Co-

operative Court or on acquisition made during the pendency of the litigation?

34. The answer to the first question to our mind is plain. The property in which the 3rd party acquired interest must bear some relationship with the dispute pending before the tribunal. To hold otherwise would be to enable the Co-operative Court to examine questions unconnected with the dispute pending before it and wholly unconnected with the affairs of the Society. An illogical result to be normally avoided unless compelled by the express language of the Act.

35. Coming to the second question, learned counsel for the appellant argued that the intention of the Legislature is to be gathered from the language of the sub-section (3)(a) and the employment of the present perfect tense (has acquired any interest) must only lead to a conclusion that the Legislature intended the Co-operative Court to deal with only the cases of acquisition of interest in the property during the pendency of the litigation before it. On the other hand, Shri Sundaram argued that  there is no warrant for such an inference in the language of sub-

section (3)(a).

36. We are of the opinion that having regard to the language of Section 94, sub-section (3)(a), more specifically ""has acquired any interest"", the acquisition of the interest contemplated is only an acquisition made during the pendency of the dispute before the Co-

operative Court. For the reason that such an acquisition of interest is qualified by the words, ""in the property of a person who is a party to the dispute"", we hold so for another reason also.

37. To hold otherwise, would lead to a situation where a dispute between an enumerated person and a 3rd party would become amenable to the jurisdiction of the Co-operative Court at the instance of the persons enumerated under Section 91 but not at the instance of a 3rd party in view of the judgment of this Court in (1991) 1 SCC 469. An absurd situation, ex facie violative of Article 14, in as much as such a construction would lead to a situation that with reference to a dispute, the affected parties are compelled to approach different fora for the adjudication of the same dispute depending upon the fact which party is seeking a relief. Such a construction, being inconsistent with a constitutional mandate, is impermissible.

38. For coming to the conclusion that the suits in question are not maintainable and the dispute could be examined exclusively by the Co-operative Court, the High Court proceeded on the basis that it is possible to challenge the resolution and the conveyance independently. Starting from such a premise, the High Court opined that challenge alone to the resolution without challenging the conveyance is possible but not vice-versa. The reason given by the High Court for the same is as follows:-

""If Court passes a decree or order setting aside the resolution of the general body, the validity of the conveyance will not be intact, but if a decree or order is made merely setting aside the conveyance, the resolution of the General body will remain intact. By the conveyance land owned by the Society is transferred. The society is a body corporate. The person or persons who have signed the conveyance on behalf of the Society derive the authority to do so from resolution of the General Body. If the resolution is set aside or is declared invalid the act of the person of executing the conveyance would become unauthorised. Such an order in relation to the validity of the General Body resolution will impair the validity of the conveyance. Consequently, if the resolution remains intact but the conveyance is set aside for some reason the Society may be in a position to execute another conveyance pursuant to the resolution of the general body.""
We do not propose to examine the correctness of the legal premise that the general body resolution and the conveyance could be segregated in a dispute such as one on the hand. For the sake of argument, we presume that it is possible for the plaintiffs, appellants herein, to challenge only the general body resolution. We also presume that the conclusion arrived at by the High Court that if the general body resolution is set aside, the same will impair the  validity of the conveyance even without an appropriate declaration by a competent judicial body. (We emphasise that we only presume so without examining to the said conclusion for the limited purpose) If the resolution dated 6th December, 2009 alone is challenged before the Co-operative Court, in view of our conclusion recorded earlier, the respondents 22 and 23 (the beneficiaries of the resolution) could not be made parties before the Co-operative Court. In such a situation, even if the Co-operative Court came to the conclusion that the resolution is illegal, it would always be open for the respondents 22 and 23 to ignore such a determination as they are not parties to the proceedings and assert their title on the basis of the conveyance dated 7th December, 2009. If any party such as the plaintiffs (the appellants herein) disputes the validity of the title conveyed thereunder, necessarily such a dispute would have to be adjudicated by a competent Court under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure wherein, necessarily, the question whether a valid title was conveyed in favour of respondents 22 and 23 by the society would arise for determination. The legality of the resolution would still have to be gone into again. Therefore, in our opinion, the premise in which the High Court commenced its enquiry itself is wrong.

39. For all the above-mentioned reasons, we are of the opinion that the conclusion of the High Court that the suits in question are  not maintainable on the ground that the dispute is amenable to the exclusive jurisdiction under Section 91 of the Act to the Co-

operative Court cannot be sustained and the same is required to be set aside.

40. That takes us to the next question raised in these appeals -

whether the High Court was right in going into the maintainability of the suits in question. Shri Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for some of the respondents submitted that in view of the provisions contained in Section 9A of the Code, which was introduced by local amendment of the Maharashtra Legislature to the Code by Maharashtra Act No.65 of 1977, the course of action followed by the High Court is not only justified but also the Court is obliged to follow such a course of action. Section 9A reads as follows:

""9A. Whereof the hearing of application relating to interim relief in a suit, objection to jurisdiction is taken, such issue to be decided by the Court as a preliminary issue.-
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code or any other law for the time beiong in force, if, at the hearing of any application for granting or setting aside an order granting any interim relief, whether by way of stay, injunction, appointment of a receiver or otherwise, made in any suit, an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain such a suit is taken by any of the parties to the suit, the Court shall proceed to determine at the hearing of such application the issue as to the jurisdiction as a preliminary issue before granting or setting aside the order granting the interim relief. Any such application shall be heard and disposed of by the Court as expeditiously as possible and shall not in any case be adjourned to the hearing of the suit.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained ion sub-section (1), at the hearing of any such application, the Court may grant such interim relief as it may consider necessary, pending determination by it of the preliminary issue as to the jurisdiction.""
The language of Section 9A is self-explanatory. We accept the submission made by Shri Venugopal in toto.

41. Coming to the question of the interim order in view of our conclusion that the suits in question are maintainable and having regard to the fact that the suits are to be tried by the High Court in exercise of its original jurisdiction, we do not propose to pass any interim order and leave it open to the High Court to consider the applications filed by the plaintiffs for interim orders in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders. The principles governing the grant of interim orders are too well settled and we need not expound the same once again. However, we would like to indicate that on the question of the existence of a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiffs, the following factors are germane and require to be examined. Having regard to the content of the plaint, we are of the opinion that the nature of the legal right, the plaintiffs claim for seeking the relief such as the one sought in the suits necessarily depends upon the byelaws of the Society, the rights and obligations of the various classes of its members with respect to the property in dispute. The High Court may examine the above aspects before passing an appropriate interim order.

42. In view of the above, we also deem it proper to direct all the parties to maintain status quo as on today for a period of two weeks to enable the Bombay High Court to examine the applications of the plaintiffs for interim orders and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.

43. The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.",0,
V.K. Naswa,"1. This writ petition has been filed making grievance that the respondents, namely, Yog Guru Baba Ramdev; Shri Anna Hazare, Mrs. Kiran Bedi and others have, on several occasions insulted the National Flag and violated the norms of waiving of National Flag, as provided in the Flag Code 2002. Thus, the petitioner has sought relief that a sum of Rs.10,00,000,00/- (Rupees Ten crores) be recovered from Baba Ramdev for misusing National Flag for gaining  undue mileage benefiting his commercial ends (yoga business) as well as the political gain drive during agitations; Shri Anna Hazare and others be directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000,00/- (Rupees Ten crores) to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund for using/misusing National Flag for gaining the political mileage during agitations, and further to issue direction to the Central Government through Ministry of Law & Justice to revise the Flag Code of India 2002 and amend the same incorporating the amendment suggested by the petitioner himself.

2. The petitioner appears in person and on being asked by the court it has been pointed out by him that against the above referred respondents he has filed the criminal complaints before the police authorities and he has been pursuing the said remedy simultaneously.

3. The issue involved in the case has been dealt with by this Court elaborately in Union of India v. Naveen Jindal & Anr., AIR 2004 SC 1559, interpreting the clauses contained in the Flag Code 2002 and explained as under what circumstances and in what manner the National Flag can be hoisted by the individuals. The Flag Code is divided into 3 parts. Part II provides for the mode and manner of hoisting/displaying/use of National Flag by Members of Public, Private Organisations, Educational Institutions etc. From reading of  clause 2.1 of Section 1 appear in Part II of the Flag Code, it is evident that there is no restriction on the display of National Flag by members of general public, private organizations and educational institutions etc. except to the extent provided in the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 and any other law enacted on the subject. This Court has further held that Flag Code is not the law within the meaning of Article 13(3)(a) of the Constitution of India.

However, right to fly National Flag is a fundamental right. Further the Flag Code provides guidelines to be observed for preservation of dignity and respect to the National Flag.

4. In view of the above, the National Flag is both a benediction and a beckoning. Thus, in case a person shows any kind of disrespect to the National Flag or does not observe the terms contained in the Code, legal action may be taken against him under the relevant statutory provisions. However, these are the questions of facts as to whether on a particular event a particular person has shown any kind of disrespect to the National Flag. For that purpose, the petitioner has already filed complaint before the authorities concerned. Thus, he cannot pursue the remedy simultaneously by filing the writ petition and on that count the petition is liable to be  dismissed. More so, such a factual controversy cannot be examined in a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.

5. The petitioner-in-person has emphasised that he has approached this Court to issue directions to the Central Government through Ministry of Law & Justice to amend the law in this regard and in the alternative, this court itself may issue appropriate directions in this regard.

It is a settled legal proposition that the court can neither legislate nor issue a direction to the Legislature to enact in a particular manner.

6. In Mullikarjuna Rao & Ors. etc. etc. v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. etc. etc., AIR 1990 SC 1251; and V.K. Sood v.

Secretary, Civil Aviation & Ors., AIR 1993 SC 2285, this Court has held that Writ Court, in exercise of its power under Article 226, has no power even indirectly require the Executive to exercise its law-making power. The Court observed that it is neither legal nor proper for the High Court to issue direction or advisory sermons to the Executive in respect of the sphere which is exclusively within the domain of the Executive under the Constitution. The power under Article 309 of the Constitution to frame rules is the legislative power. This power under the Constitution has to be exercised by the  President or the Governor of a State, as the case may be. The Courts cannot usurp the functions assigned to the Executive under the Constitution and cannot even indirectly require the Executive to exercise its law-making power in any manner. The Courts cannot assume to itself a supervisory role over the rule-making power of the Executive under Article 309 of the Constitution.

7. While deciding the said case, the Court placed reliance on a large number of judgments, particularly M/s. Narinder Chand Hem Raj & Ors. v. Lt. Governor, Administrator, Union Territory, Himachal Pradesh & Ors., AIR 1971 SC 2399, where it has been held that legislative power can be exercised only by the legislature or its delegate and none else.

8. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. A Parent of a Student of Medical College, Shimla & Ors., AIR 1985 SC 910, this Court deprecated the practice adopted by the Courts to issue directions to the legislature to enact a legislation to meet a particular situation observing :

""...The direction given by the Division Bench was really nothing short of an indirect attempt to compel the State Government to initiate legislation with a view to curbing the evil of ragging, for Otherwise it is difficult to see why, after the clear and categorical statement by the chief Secretary  on behalf of the State Government that the Government will introduce legislation if found necessary and so advised, the Division Bench should have proceeded to again give the same direction. Thus the Division Bench was clearly not entitled to do. It is entirely a matter for the executive branch of the Government to decided whether or not to introduce any particular legislation.""
9. In Asif Hameed & Ors. v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors., AIR 1989 SC 1899, this Court while dealing with a case like this at hand observed:

""While doing so, the Court must remain within its self-imposed limits. The Court sits in judgment on the action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government. While exercising power of judicial review of administrative action, the Court is not an Appellate Authority. The Constitution does not permit the Court to direct or advise the Executive in matter of policy or to sermonize qua any matter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere of Legislature or Executive.""
(Emphasis added)
10. In Union of India & Anr. v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal, AIR 1992 SC 96, this Court similarly observed :
""It is not the duty of the Court either to enlarge the scope of the legislation.....The Court cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the Court.""
11. Similarly in Ajaib Singh v. Sirhind Co-operative Marketing-cum-Processing Service Society Ltd. & Anr., AIR 1999 SC 1351, this Court held that Court cannot fix a period of limitation, if not fixed by the legislature, as ""the Courts can admittedly interpret the law and do not make laws."" The Court cannot interpret the statutory provision in such a manner ""which would amount to legislation intentionally left over by the legislature"".
12. A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr., AIR 2002 SC 2112, observing that the Court cannot issue direction to the legislature for amending the Act or Rules. It is for the Parliament to amend the Act or Rules.

13. In District Mining Officer & Ors. v. Tata Iron & Steel Co.

& Anr., (2001) 7 SCC 358, this Court held that function of the Court is only to expound the law and not to legislate.

14. Similarly, in Supreme Court Employees' Welfare Association v. Union of India & Anr., (1989) 4 SCC 187, this Court held that Court cannot direct the legislature to enact a  particular law for the reason that under the constitutional scheme the Parliament exercises sovereign power to enact law and no outside power or authority can issue a particular piece of legislation.

(See also: State of Jammu & Kashmir v. A.R. Zakki & Ors., AIR 1992 SC 1546).

15. In Union of India v. Prakash P. Hinduja & Anr., AIR 2003 SC 2612, this Court held that if the Court issues a direction which amounts to legislation and is not complied with by the State, it cannot be held that the State has committed the Contempt of Court for the reason that the order passed by the Court was without jurisdiction and it has no competence to issue a direction amounting to legislation.

16. The issue involved herein was considered by this Court in University of Kerala v. Council, Principals', Colleges, Kerala & Ors., AIR 2010 SC 2532. The Court elaborately explained the scope of separation of powers of different organs of the State under our Constitution; the validity of judicial legislation and if it is at all permissible, its limits; and the validity of judicial activism and the need for judicial restraint, etc. The Court observed:

""At the outset, we would say that it is not possible for this Court to give any direction for amending the Act or the statutory rules. It is for the Parliament to amend the Act and the Rules.""
17. In State of U.P. & Ors. v. Jeet S. Bisht & Anr., (2007) 6 SCC 586, this Court held that issuing any such direction may amount to amendment of law which falls exclusively within the domain of the executive/legislature and the Court cannot amend the law.

18. In Delhi Jal Board v. National Campaign for Dignity and Rights of Sewerage and Allied Workers & Ors., (2011) 8 SCC 568, this Court while dealing with the issue made the observation that in exceptional circumstances where there is inaction by the executive, for whatever reason, the judiciary must step in, in exercise of its Constitutional obligations to provide a solution till such time the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting proper legislation to cover the field.

(See also: Vishaka & Ors. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. AIR 1997 SC 3011; Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v. Union of India & Ors., AIR 2008 SC 2116; and Destruction of Public and Private Properties v. State of A.P. & Ors., AIR 2009 SC 2266)
19. Thus, it is crystal clear that the Court has a very limited role and in exercise of that, it is not open to have judicial legislation.

Neither the Court can legislate, nor it has any competence to issue directions to the legislature to enact the law in a particular manner.

20. In view of the above, the petition lacks merit. Facts of the case do not warrant any interference by this Court. In such a fact-

situation, no relief can be granted to the petitioner. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.",0,
Jeevan Chandrabhan Idnani & Anr.,"Leave granted.

2. The interpretation and purport of the second proviso to Sub-section(2) of Section 31(A) of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as ""Municipal Corporation Act"") falls for the consideration of this Court.

3. The constitution of the ""Municipal Corporations""1 (in the State of Maharashtra), their powers, functions and various allied matters are regulated by the above-

mentioned Act. Section 5(2)2 of the Act declares, every ""Corporation"" shall consist of a definite number of elected and a few nominated councillors. The number of elected Councillors with respect to any Corporation is determined on the basis of the population of that Municipal Corporation. The case on hand pertains to the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, the third respondent herein, which has a total of 76 elected Councillors.

4. Election to the third respondent took place sometime in the month of February, 2007 and the Corporation was duly constituted with 76 elected Councillors. The break-

up of the 76 Councillors is specified in the Judgment under appeal as follows:-

1 Sec.2(10) - ""Corporation"" means the Municipal Corporation constituted or deemed to have been constituted for a larger urban area known as a City.

Sec. 2(8) - ""City"" means the larger urban area specified in a notification issued in respect thereof under clause (2) of article 243-Q of the Constitution of India or under sub-section(2) of section 3 of the Act, forming a City.

22 Sec.5(2) Each Corporation shall consist of,-

(a) such number of councilors, elected directly at ward elections, as is specified in the table below-
T A B L E XXX XXX XXX XXX
(b) such number of nominated councilors not exceeding five, having special knowledge or experience in Municipal Administration to be nominated by the Corporation in such manner as may be prescribed.
5. Apart from the fourteen Members elected as Councillors to the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation on behalf of the Lok Bharti Party, two more Councillors, one independent and the other a lone Councillor, belonging to the Republican Party of India (G), joined hands with the Councillors of the Lok Bharti Party and formed a front/aghadi immediately after the election availing the facility provided under the 2 nd proviso to Section 31A(2) of the Municipal Corporation Act.

6. Respondent Nos. 6 to 13 herein were admittedly members of the said Aghadi.

However, they decided to quit the Aghadi and form a `Swatantar Aghadi' and addressed a letter dated 23rd February, 2011 to the first respondent herein requesting the first respondent to make suitable changes in the records maintained under the Disqualification Act and the rules made thereunder.

7. The first respondent accepted the above-mentioned request. The same is evidenced by his communication dated 11th March, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as `the impugned order').

8. Challenging the above-mentioned communication, two of the Councillors belonging to the Lok Bharti Party approached the Bombay High Court by way of a writ petition (civil) No. 2237 of 2011. By the judgment under appeal, the said writ petition was dismissed.

9. The substance of the objection to the legality of the impugned order is that in the light of the language of the second proviso to Section 31A(2), formation of a front or aghadi after the completion of the election process to the municipal body is permissible only when that is done within one month from the date of the notification of the results of the election. The impugned communication purports to recognise an aghadi/front beyond the above-mentioned period of one month which is clearly impermissible and hence illegal.

10. The High Court rejected the above-mentioned submission. On an examination of the various provisions of the Act, the Court rightly held that the appointment to the four categories of Committees specified under Sections 31A(1) takes place ""at least more than once"" ""during the tenure of the Corporation"". Therefore the High Court opined ""the relative strength of the recognised parties or registered parties or groups at the time of appointments"" whenever made ""would be relevant"". Hence, found no reason to find fault with the impugned order. The correctness of the said judgment is in issue before us.

11. To examine the correctness of the conclusion reached by the High Court, a brief survey of the relevant provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act is required. Section 20 of the Act contemplates the constitution of a Standing Committee consisting of 16 Councillors to be appointed by the Corporation out of its own body. It is further  stipulated in Section 20(3) that half of the members of the Standing Committee shall retire every succeeding year.

12. Section 24 authorises the Standing Committee to delegate any of its powers and duties to any Special Committee appointed under Section 30 of the Act.

13. Section 31 contemplates the appointment of ad-hoc Committees for inquiring into or reporting or for giving opinion with reference to such subjects relating to the purpose of this Act.

14. Section 31(A) of the Act stipulates that in the case of (a) Standing, (b) Transport,

(c) Special or (d) ad hoc Committees, the appointment of Councillors to such Committees shall be made by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Sub-section (2) thereof.

""31A. Appointment by nomination committees to be by proportional representation (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the rules or bye-laws made thereunder, in the case of the following Committees, except where it is provided by this Act, that the appointment of a Councillor to any Committee shall be by virtue of his holding any office, appointment of Councillors to these Committees, whether in regular or casual vacancies, shall be made by the Corporation by nominating Councillors in accordance with the provisions of sub- section (2):-
                          (a)      Standing Committee;

                          (b)      Transport Committee;

                          (c)      Any special Committee appointed under section 30;

                          (d)      Any ad hoc Committee appointed under section 31.""





Sub-section (2) stipulates that in making nomination of the Councillors to the above-
mentioned Committees, the Corporation is required to take into account the relative strength of recognised or registered parties or groups in the Corporation and nominate members as nearly as in proportion to the strength of such parties or groups in the Corporation.

""31A(2). In nominating the Councillors on the Committee, the Corporation shall take into account the relative strength of the recognised parties or registered parties or groups and nominate members, as nearly as may be, in proportion to the strength of such parties or groups in the Corporation, after consulting the Leader of the House, the Leader of Opposition and the leader of each such party or group.""
In making such nomination, the Corporation is required to consult the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition etc.

15. However, the first proviso to sub-section (2) would recognise the authority of the Municipal Corporation to nominate any Councillor to any one of the above-

mentioned Committees notwithstanding the fact that such a Councillor does not belong to any party or group.

""Proviso (1) - Provided that, nothing contained in this sub-section be construed as preventing the Corporation from nominating on the Committee any member not belonging to any such party or group.""
Second proviso - the exact meaning and scope of which is required to be examined in this appeal - reads as follows:

""Proviso (2) - Provided further that, for the purpose of deciding the relative strength of the recognised parties or registered parties or groups under this Act, the recognised parties or registered parties or groups, or elected Councillors not belonging to any such party or group may, notwithstanding anything contained in the Maharashtra Local Authority Members' Disqualification Act, 1986, within a period of one month from the date of notification of elections results, from the aghadi or front and, on its registration, the provision of the said Act shall apply to the members of such aghadi or front, as if it is a registered pre-poll aghadi or front.""
16. We may mention here that some of the political parties to which the councillors of the 3rd respondent corporation belong to, such as Bhartiya Janata Party, Indian National Congress, National Congress, Shiv Sena, etc., are indisputably registered political parties under Section 29A of the Representations of the People's Act and also recognised political parties in terms of the allotment of the symbols orders 1968 made by the Election Commission of India. Unfortunately there is no material on record to indicate whether Lok Bharti Party is either a registered or a recognised political party.

17. As already noticed under Section 31A of the Municipal Corporation Act, the Corporation is required to take into account the relative strength of the recognised parties or registered parties or groups. The expressions (1) `registered party', (2) `recognised party', (3) groups and (4) `front or aghadi' occurring in Section 31A of the Municipal Corporation Act are not defined under the said Act. However, the expression `front' or `aghadi' is defined under Section 2(a) of the Disqualification Act.

""2.(a) ""aghadi"" or ""front"" means a group of persons who have formed themselves into a party for the purpose of setting up candidates for election to a local authority.""
18. The expressions ""recognised party"" and ""registered party"" in the context of political parties have a definite legal connotation in this country.

19. Part IVA of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for the registration of political parties. Section 29A prescribes the procedure for the registration of a political party. Such registration is not compulsory, but optional.

However, registration enables a political party to claim certain benefits under law such as accepting of a contribution (See Section 29B ) from any person or company etc. Similarly under the Election Symbols (Allotment and Reservation) Order, 1968 certain symbols are reserved for a `recognised political party' for the exclusive allotment to the candidates set up by such political party. The above mentioned order stipulates the various conditions which are required to be satisfied before a political party is entitled for recognition under the said order.

20. The expression ""political party"" itself is defined under the said order to mean a political party registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

""Political party' means an association or body of individual citizens of India registered with the Commission as a political party under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.""
In the absence of any clear definition to the contra in either of the local acts of Maharashtra referred to earlier, coupled with the established practice in this country that the various `recognised political parties' under the symbols Order, 1968 set up  candidates at the elections to the local bodies such as the third respondent and they are permitted to use the symbols which are reserved for them under the provisions of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, the expressions `political party', `registered party' and `recognised party' occurring in Section 31A of the Municipal Corporation Act, must necessarily be given the same meaning as assigned to them in the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.

21. The expression ""groups"", occurring under Section 31A(2), once again, is not defined but in the context and scheme of the Section, in our view, the expression ""group"" must be understood only as meaning - Councillors not belonging to either a registered political party or a recognised political party, but persons set up at the Municipal election by an Aghadi as defined under the Disqualification Act.

22. Having arrived at the meaning of various undefined expressions employed in Section 31A of the Municipal Corporation Act, the scheme and purpose of the 2nd proviso to Section 31A(2) is required to be examined. To understand the purport and scheme of the 2nd proviso to Section 31A(2) of the Municipal Corporation act, we must first examine relevance of the reference to the Maharashtra Local Authority Members Disqualification Act, 1986 made in the said proviso, and the purpose sought to be achieved by the legislature by excluding the application of the said Act through the  devise of employing a non obstante clause. For a ready reference the relevant portion of the second proviso may again be extracted which reads as follows:-

""***** notwithstanding anything contained in the Maharashtra Local Authority Members' Disqualification Act, 1986,********""

The State of Maharashtra made an enactment called Maharashtra Local Authority Members Disqualification Act, 1986. The Act provides for the disqualification of Members of the Local Authorities i.e. Municipal Bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions in certain circumstances. Section 3 of the said Act declares that an elected Councillor of a Municipal Corporation shall be disqualified for being (i.e. continuing as) a Councillor in three contingencies, if such person - (i) voluntarily gives up the membership of the political party which had set him up as a candidate at the election to the Municipal Corporation, (ii) on voting or abstaining from voting in any meeting of the concerned municipal body, contrary to any directions issued by the political party to which such a person belongs. Section 3 of the Disqualification Act, in so far as it is relevant for the present purposes, reads as follows:-

"" 3.(1) Subject to the provisions of [section 5] a councillor ................ belonging to any political party or aghadi or front shall be disqualified for being a councillor ................ :--
(a) if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such political party or aghadi or front; or
(b) if he votes or abstains from voting in any meeting of a Municipal Corporation, Municipal Council, ............................ contrary to any direction issued by the political party or aghadi, or front to which he belongs to by any person or authority authorised by any of them in this behalf, without obtaining,  in either case, the prior permission of such political party or aghadi or front, person or authority and such voting or abstention has not been condoned by such political party or aghadi or front, person or authority within fifteen days from the date of such voting or abstention:
Provided that, such voting or abstention without prior permission from such party or aghadi or front, at election of any office, authority or committee under any relevant municipal law ........................ shall not be condoned under this clause;
Explanation.--For the purpose of this section--
(a) a person elected as a councillor, ................ shall be deemed to belong to the political party or aghadi or front, if any, by which he was set up as candidate for election as such councillor ........... ; ""
[emphasis supplied]
(iii) under sub-section(2) that an elected councillor who had been elected as such otherwise than as a candidate set up by any political party or aghadi or front (i.e. an independent councillor) shall be disqualified if he joins any political party or aghadi after such election.
""(2) An elected councillor, ************** who has been elected as such otherwise than as a candidate set up by any political party or aghadi or front shall be disqualified for being a councillor, or as the case may be, a member if he joins any political party or aghadi or front after such election.""
23. Section 5 of the Act carves out an exception to the Rule contained under Section 3(1) i.e. it stipulates contingencies in which an elected councillor does not incur the disqualification contemplated under Section 3(1) notwithstanding the fact that such person parted ways with the original political party to which he/she originally belonged to. The complete scheme of Section 5 may not be necessary for the purpose of this case but we must take note of the fact that Section 5 does not recognise any  exception to the rule contained in Section3(2) with respect to the independent councillors.
24. The second proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 31A enables the formation of a Aghadi or front within a period of one month from the date of notification of the election results. Such an Aghadi or front can be formed by various possible combinations of councillors belonging to either two or more registered parties or recognised parties or independent councillors. The proviso categorically stipulates that such a formation of an `Aghadi' or `front' is possible notwithstanding anything contained in the Disqualification Act. Because an ""Aghadi"" or ""front"", as defined under the Disqualification Act, clearly, can only be the combination of a group of persons forming themselves into a party prior to the election for setting up candidates at an election to a local authority but not a combination of political parties or political parties and individuals.

25. Therefore, second proviso to Section 31A (2) of the Municipal Corporation Act which is a later expression of the will of the sovereign, in contrast to the stipulation as contained under Section 2(a) and 3(2) of the Disqualification Act, would enable the formation of post electoral aghadis or fronts. However, such a formation is only meant for a limited purpose of enabling such aghadis to secure better representation in the various categories of the Committees specified under Section 31A. The component parties or individual independent Councillors, as the case may be, in the case of a given  front/aghadi do not lose their political identify and merge in to the aghadi/front or bring into existence a new political party. There is no merger such as the one contemplated under Section 5 of the Disqualification Act. It is further apparent from the language of the second proviso that on the formation of such an Aghadi or front, the same is required to be registered. The procedure for such registration is contained in the Maharashtra Local Authority Members Disqualification Rules, 1987.

26. Once such an Aghadi is registered by a legal fiction created under the proviso, such an Aghadi is treated as if it were a pre-poll Aghadi or front. The proviso further declares that once such registration is made, the provisions of the Disqualification Act apply to the Members of such post poll Aghadi. We do not propose to examine the legal consequences of such a declaration as it appears from the record that a complaint has already been lodged against the respondents 6 to 13 herein under the provisions of the Disqualification Act. The limited question before us is whether the 1st respondent was legally right in registering an Aghadi or front formed after the lapse of one month from the date of the notification of the election results.

27. At paras 19 and 20 of the judgment under appeal, the High Court held:

""19. Once it is held that the appointment to the various Committees contemplated under Section 31A of the B.P.M.C. Act takes place more than once, the relative strength of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups at the time of their appointment would be relevant. In other words, the relative strength of the parties that was at the time of registration with a period of one month from the date of notification of the election results, would be relevant only on the first occasion after the general elections are held. 
                 xxxx               xxxx               xxxx

                 xxxx               xxxx               xxxx





20. ............ If the interpretation suggested by the petitioners is accepted, in our opinion, Rule 3(4) of the Rules would be rendered otiose. We have already held that the provisions of the Act and Rules are required to be taken into account while interpreting the provisions of Section 31A of the B.P.M.C. Act. In view thereof, we are clearly of the opinion that the appointment of various Committees under Section 31A of the B.P.M.C. Act not being one time affair, the relative strength of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups, subject to any change, if any, will have to be taken into account at the time of appointment of councillors to these committees.""
In substance, the High Court held that the interpretation of the Section 31A depends upon the tenor and scheme of the subordinate legislation. Such a principle of statutory construction is not normally resorted to save in the case of interpretation of an old enactment where the language is ambiguous. We are conscious of the fact that there is some difference of opinion on this principle but for the purpose of the present case we do not think it necessary to examine the proposition in detail as in our opinion the language of Section 31A is too explicit to require any other external aid for the interpretation of the same. Subordinate legislation made by the executive in exercise of the powers delegated by the legislature, at best, may reflect the understanding of the executive of the scope of the powers delegated. But there is no inherent guarantee such an understanding is consistent with the true meaning and purport of the parent enactment.

28. Such variations of the relative strength of aghadis would have various legal consequences provided under the Disqualification Act. Depending upon the fact situation in a given case, the variation might result in the consequence of rendering  some of the Councillors disqualified for continuing as Councillors. Section 31A of the Municipal Corporation Act only enables the formation of an aghadi or front within a month from the date of the notification of the results of the election to the Municipal Corporation. To permit recognition of variations in the relative strength of the political parties beyond the above mentioned period of one month would be plainly in violation of the language of the second proviso to Section 31A.

29. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment under appeal, as well as the impugned order, cannot be sustained. We allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order.",1,

1. The petitioner has filed the present application under Sections 11(4) and (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the `Act') read with paragraph 2 of the appointment of the Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996. It is stated that a contract was entered into between

- 1 -

the parties for the supply of Base Bleed Units. Initially the quantity to be supplied was 42,000 units. Later on, the quantity was increased to 52,000 units as per Clause 20 of the agreement. By 5th January, 2005, the petitioner had supplied substantial quantity of the goods. However, some of the goods supplied by the petitioner were rejected by the respondent. The petitioner, thereafter, informed the respondent that two more lots were ready for discharge on 17th March, 2005. However, Union of India never responded to the letter, hence, loss and damage has been caused to the petitioner. In April, 2005, after various discussions, the petitioner came to know that improper fuzes were used by the Union of India which led to the problem that occurred in the lots which were rejected. Thereafter, on 21st April, 2005, Union of India put on hold all contracts.

Further, on 14th May, 2008, Union of India sent a notice seeking refund of amount of US $ 23,20,240, failing which legal action was to issue.

- 2 -

2. The disputes having arisen between the parties, efforts were made to resolve the same. The details of the efforts made are narrated in the petition. Since the disputes could not be resolved through mutual discussions, the DGOF appointed one Mr. A.K.

Jain, Additional General Manager, Ordnance Factory, Ambajhari, Nagpur as an arbitrator in terms of Clause 19(F) of the contract, which reads as under:-

""All the disputes and difference arising out of or in any way touching or concerning the agreement (matters for which the decision of a specific authority as specified in the contract shall be final under this agreement, shall not be subject to arbitration) shall be referred to the sole arbitration of the Director General, Ordnance Fys. Govt. of India for the time being or a Government servant appointed by him. The appointee shall not be a Govt. Servant who had dealt with the matters to which this agreement relates and that in the course of his duties as Govt. Servant has had not expressed views on all or any of the matter is in dispute or difference. In case the appointed Govt. Servant in place of the incumbents.""
3. The petitioner objected to the appointment of the Arbitrator.

The petitioner apprehended that the arbitrator would be favorably inclined towards the employer. Therefore, on 23rd January, 2009, the petitioner issued a notification under Section 14 of the

- 3 -

Arbitration Act stating that the mandate of the arbitrator had been terminated. Since inspite of the aforesaid notification, the arbitrator continued with the arbitration proceedings, the petitioner moved the Principal District Court, Chandrapur and filed Civil Misc.

Application No. 45 of 2009 under Section 14(2) of the Act. On 21st December, 2010, the Principal District Court, Chandrapur terminated the mandate of the Sole Arbitrator with the observation that the arbitrator has been biased in favour of respondent No.1. A direction was also issued in the following terms:-

""Director General, Ordnance Factory, Government of India, is appointed as an Arbitrator or he may appoint Government servant as an Arbitrator , as per Clause 19(F) of February 2004 contract and 19(E) of November 2004 contract, after following due procedure.""
4. It is an admitted fact that pursuant to the aforesaid directions, within 30 days, DGOF did not himself commence the arbitration proceedings; nor did he appoint any Government servant as an arbitrator. The petitioner has, therefore, moved the present petition under Section 11(6) of the Act on 2nd of March, 2011 seeking appointment of an independent arbitrator. The petitioner claims

- 4 -

that the directions issued by the District Court are without any authority or jurisdiction and as such void ab initio. According to the petitioner, the direction of the learned District Judge is based upon an incorrect interpretation of Section 15 of the Act, whereby the learned Judge assumed the authority to appoint an arbitrator, which is beyond her jurisdiction. The Act does not make provision for the appointment of an arbitrator other than in accordance with the arbitration agreement and in the limited circumstances provided for in Section 11. The petitioner also claims that the DGOF would be disqualified to act as an arbitrator as the dispute is against the Government of India and particularly against the Ordnance Factory, Ministry of Defence. If the Director General, Ordnance Factory, Government of India (DGOF) or a Government servant is appointed as an arbitrator, he shall always be bound by the directions/instructions issued by his superior authorities and, therefore, such an arbitrator would not be in a position to independently decide the dispute between the parties. According to the petitioner, such an appointment would be contrary to the

- 5 -

provisions of Section 12 of the Act. The petitioner further claims that the DGOF has already through his actions in the dispute between the parties demonstrated his lack of independence and impartiality. The learned District Judge in her judgment alluded to the fact that the DGOF without receiving any request for referral of the dispute between the petitioner and the respondent colluded with the previous arbitrator to appoint him as an arbitrator without any notice to the petitioner. The petitioner further claims that the DGOF has been directly involved in the dispute as would be evident from the correspondence between the petitioner and the respondent. The petitioner thereafter makes a reference to the letter dated 30th June, 2008 wherein the DGOF took the view that the petitioner is liable to replace the rejected Base Bleed units, as alleged by the respondent, making specific reference to the correspondence in which respondent stated its claim against the petitioner and cancelled the contract with the petitioner. The petitioner further claims that the DGOF has failed to appoint the arbitrator either as directed by the learned District Judge or in

- 6 -

accordance with Section 15 of the Act within 30 days of the order dated 21st December, 2010. Therefore, the respondent has forfeited the right to make an appointment from the date of the filing of the petition.

5. The respondent has controverted the plea put forward by the petitioner by way of a detailed counter affidavit. It is claimed by the respondent that the petition under Section 11(6) of the Act is not maintainable, as Mr.Satyanarayana has been appointed as a substitute arbitrator on 16th March, 2011. The petitioner was duly notified about the appointment of the arbitrator in its letter dated 26th March, 2011. The petitioner was requested to forward its claim within 10 days. The petitioner was informed that if such a claim does not reach by 8th April, 2011, the arbitrator will presume that the petitioner did not have any further claim. Upon receipt of that letter, the petitioner objected to the appointment of a new arbitrator by its letter dated 15th April, 2011, as being contrary to clause 19(F). The petitioner has wrongly claimed that since the

- 7 -

appointment of the arbitrator was not made prior to the filing of the petition under Section 11(6), the respondent has forfeited the right to make the appointment.

6. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

7. On the basis of facts narrated above, Mr. Naphade submits that the petitioner has forfeited its right to appoint the arbitrator.

In support of the submission, he relied on the judgments of this Court in the case of Datar Switchgears Ltd. Vs. Tata Finance Ltd.



&
    Anr.1
                 ,    Punj Lloyd Ltd.  Vs.  Petrone
                                                   t MHB   Ltd.2
                                                                        and  Yashwith 


Constructions (P) Ltd. Vs. Simplex Concrete Piles India Ltd. & Anr.

8. On the other hand, Mr. Raval, appearing for the Union of India has submitted that the petitioner has failed to make out a case for not appearing before the arbitrator appointed pursuant to the order 1 2000 (8) SCC 151 2 2006 (2) SCC 638 3 2006 (6) SCC 204

- 8 -

of the Principal District Court, Chandrapur on 21st December, 2010.

He submits that the respondents have willingly accepted the appointment of the earlier arbitrator in accordance with the arbitration clause. Therefore, they can have no justification to challenge the appointment of the present arbitrator, who has only been appointed as the mandate of the earlier arbitrator had been terminated by the orders of the Court. The petitioner was duly informed about the appointment of the arbitrator on 16th March, 2011. The arbitrator had intimated both the parties about the appointment and had requested them to submit their respective claims within a period of 10 days. It was only at that stage that the petitioner wrote a letter dated 15th April, 2011 stating that the appointment of the arbitrator was in violation of arbitration clause.

Mr. Raval further submitted that in the present circumstances, the matter is squarely covered against the petitioner by the judgment in the case of Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Ors. Vs. Raja Transport Private Limited4 . On the basis of the aforesaid judgment, the learned counsel submitted that the present petition 4 (2009) 8 SCC 520

- 9 -

under Section 11(6) is misconceived, as the Sole Arbitrator has been appointed in terms of the agreed procedure contained in Clause 19 (F) and (E).

9. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel. In my opinion, Mr. Naphade is correct in his submission that the matter is squarely covered by the judgment in Datar Switchgears Ltd. (supra), wherein this Court has observed as follows:-

""19. So far as cases falling under Section 11(6) are concerned -- such as the one before us -- no time limit has been prescribed under the Act, whereas a period of 30 days has been prescribed under Section 11(4) and Section 11(5) of the Act. In our view, therefore, so far as Section 11(6) is concerned, if one party demands the opposite party to appoint an arbitrator and the opposite party does not make an appointment within 30 days of the demand, the right to appointment does not get automatically forfeited after expiry of 30 days. If the opposite party makes an appointment even after 30 days of the demand, but before the first party has moved the court under Section 11, that would be sufficient. In other words, in cases arising under Section 11(6), if the opposite party has not made an appointment within 30 days of demand, the right to make appointment is not forfeited but continues, but an appointment has to be made before the former files application under Section 11
- 10 -
 seeking appointment of an arbitrator. Only then the right of the opposite party ceases. We do not, therefore, agree with the observation in the above judgments that if the appointment is not made within 30 days of demand, the right to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(6) is forfeited.""
The aforesaid ratio has been reiterated in Punj Lloyd Ltd.
(supra).

10. In the facts and circumstances of this case, it would not be possible to accept the submission of Mr. Raval that the present petition filed by the petitioner under Section 11(6) of the Act is not maintainable. On the admitted facts, it is evident that the mandate of the earlier arbitrator Mr. Arun Kumar Jain was terminated by the orders passed by the Principal District Court, Chandrapur in Civil Misc. Application No. 45 of 2009 by order dated 21st December, 2010. A perusal of the aforesaid order would show that the petitioner had challenged the validity of Clause 19(F). The aforesaid submission was rejected by the Court with the observation that the same cannot be the subject matter which could be resolved in a

- 11 -

petition under Section 14(2) of the Act. The petitioner was given an opportunity to challenge the clauses in an appropriate forum. The District Judge, however, accepted the submission of the petitioner that there are justifiable reasons to indicate that the arbitrator has not acted fairly. Hence the mandate of Mr. A.K. Jain as the Sole Arbitrator was terminated. In accordance with Section 15(2) of the Act, DGOF was appointed as an arbitrator. He was also given an option to appoint Government servant as an arbitrator as per the arbitration clause. It is a matter of record that DGOF did not act himself as an arbitrator, pursuant to the aforesaid order of the Principal District Judge, Chandrapur dated 21st December, 2010.

Mr. Satyanarayana, the subsequent arbitrator, had not been appointed till 16th March, 2011. The present petition was moved on 2nd March, 2011. Therefore, the respondents had clearly forfeited their right to make the appointment of an arbitrator. Consequently, the appointment of Mr. Satyanarayana, as an arbitrator, by letter dated 16th March, 2011 cannot be sustained.

- 12 -

11. Mr. Naphade then submits that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the respondent cannot now be permitted to insist that the Court should appoint an arbitrator only in terms of the agreed procedure. In support of this submission, he emphasised that DGOF can not act as an arbitrator as the same will be against the principles of natural justice, as no one can be a judge in his own cause. He further submitted that even if any government employee is appointed as an arbitrator, he will not be in a position to act against the Union of India as he will be obliged to follow the instructions of the superiors. He placed reliance on Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited & Anr. Vs. Motorola India Priva te Limited5 . It is not possible to accept the submissions of Mr. Naphade. This Court in the case of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (supra) has considered such a submission and observed that :-

""Arbitration is a binding voluntary alternative dispute resolution process by a private forum chosen by the parties. If a party, with open eyes and full knowledge and comprehension of the relevant provision enters into a contract with a Government/statutory 5 2009 (2) SCC 337
- 13 -
 corporation/public sector undertaking containing an arbitration agreement providing that one of its Secretaries/Directors shall be the arbitrator, he cannot subsequently turn around and contend that he is agreeable for settlement of the disputes by arbitration, but not by the named arbitrator who is an employee of the other party.
It is now well settled by a series of decisions that arbitration agreements in government contracts providing that an employee of the Department (usually a high official unconnected with the work of the contract) will be the arbitrator, are neither void nor unenforceable. All the decisions proceed on the basis that when senior officers of Government/statutory corporations/public sector undertakings are appointed as arbitrators, they will function independently and impartially, even though they are employees of such institutions/organizations.""
In my opinion, the aforesaid observations are a complete answer to the submission made by Mr. Naphade.

12. Learned senior counsel then submitted that even if the arbitration clause is held to be valid, Mr. Satyanarayana still can not be permitted to continue with arbitration as the petitioner has a strong apprehension that he is biased in favour of the respondents.

In support of the submission, the learned senior counsel has relied on the various notices issued by the arbitrator which were

- 14 -

invariably received after the expiry of the time fixed by the arbitrator. In support of his submission, he relied on a judgment of this Court in the case of Denel (Proprietary) Limited Vs. Bharat Electronics Limited & Anr.6 .

13. Replying to the apprehension of bias pleaded by Mr. Naphade, it is submitted by Mr. Raval that non-receipt of the letters in time can not possibly give rise to an apprehension that Mr. Satyanarayana is in any manner biased against the petitioner. He submits that the reliance of the petitioner on the judgment in Denel (Proprietary) Limited (supra) is also misconceived as the aforesaid judgment was confined to the facts of that particular matter. He, therefore, submits that the Court ought to follow the agreed procedure and not to interfere with the appointment of Mr. Satyanarayana as the arbitrator. In the alternative, he submits that even if the appointment of Mr. Satyanarayana is held to be invalid, the matter has to be left to the DGOF to either act as an arbitrator himself or to appoint an officer appointed by him.

6 2010 (6) SCC 394

- 15 -

14. It is true that in normal circumstances while exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6), the Court would adhere to the terms of the agreement as closely as possible. But if the circumstances warrant, the Chief Justice or the nominee of the Chief Justice is not debarred from appointing an independent arbitrator other then the named arbitrator.

15. A Three Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Northern Railway Administration, Ministry of Railway, New Delhi Vs. Patel Engineering Company Limited7 , considered the scope and ambit of Section 11(6) of the Act, as divergent views were taken in two decisions of this Court in Ace Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. Vs. Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.8 and Union of India Vs. Bharat Battery Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd. (supra). Upon consideration of the relevant provisions it was inter-alia observed as follows:-

""A bare reading of the scheme of Section 11 shows that the emphasis is on the terms of the agreement being 7 2008 (10) SCC 240 8 2007 (5) SCC 304

- 16 -

adhered to and/or given effect as closely as possible. In other words, the Court may ask to do what has not been done. The Court must first ensure that the remedies provided for are exhausted. It is true as contended by Mr. Desai, that it is not mandatory for the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him to appoint the named arbitrator or arbitrators. But at the same time, due regard has to be given to the qualifications required by the agreement and other considerations.""

16. Keeping in view the observations made above, I have examined the facts pleaded in this case. I am of the opinion that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, it would be necessary and advisable to appoint an independent arbitrator. In this case, the contract is with Ministry of Defence. The arbitrator Mr. Satyanarayana has been nominated by DGOF, who is bound to accept the directions issued by the Union of India. Mr. Satyanarayana is an employee within the same organization. The attitude of the respondents towards the proceeding is not indicative of an impartial approach. In fact, the mandate of the earlier arbitrator was terminated on the material produced before the Court, which indicated that the arbitrator was biased in favour of the Union of India. In the present case also, Mr. Naphade has

- 17 -

made a reference to various notices issued by the arbitrator, none of which were received by the petitioner within time. Therefore, the petitioner was effectively denied the opportunity to present his case before the Sole Arbitrator. Therefore, the apprehensions of the petitioner can not be said to be without any basis.

17. It must also be remembered that even while exercising the jurisdiction under Section 11(6), the Court is required to have due regard to the provisions contained in Section 11(8) of the Act. The aforesaid section provides that apart from ensuring that the arbitrator possesses the necessary qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties, the Court shall have due regard to other considerations as are likely to ensure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator. Keeping in view the aforesaid provision, this Court in the case of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (supra), whilst emphasizing that normally the Court shall make the appointment in terms of the agreed procedure has observed that the Chief Justice or his designate may deviate

- 18 -

from the same after recording reasons for the same. In paragraph 45 of the aforesaid judgment, it is observed as follows:-

""45. If the arbitration agreement provides for arbitration by a named arbitrator, the courts should normally give effect to the provisions of the arbitration agreement. But as clarified by Northern Railway Admn.10, where there is material to create a reasonable apprehension that the person mentioned in the arbitration agreement as the arbitrator is not likely to act independently or impartially, or if the named person is not available, then the Chief Justice or his designate may, after recording reasons for not following the agreed procedure of referring the dispute to the named arbitrator, appoint an independent arbitrator in accordance with Section 11(8) of the Act. In other words, referring the disputes to the named arbitrator shall be the rule. The Chief Justice or his designate will have to merely reiterate the arbitration agreement by referring the parties to the named arbitrator or named Arbitral Tribunal. Ignoring the named arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal and nominating an independent arbitrator shall be the exception to the rule, to be resorted for valid reasons.""
(emphasis supplied)
18. The material placed before the Court by the petitioner would indicate that it would not be unreasonable to entertain the belief that the arbitrator appointed by the respondent would not be

- 19 -

independent. That being so, the appointment of Mr. Satyanarayana can not pass the test under Section 11(8) of the Act.

19. Similarly, applying the test laid down in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (supra), this Court in the case of Denel (Proprietary) Limited (supra) also observed that the Managing Director, Bharat Electronics Limited, which is a Government company is bound by the directions/instructions issued by his superior authority. The Court also observed that according to the pleaded case of the respondents, though it was liable to pay the amount due under the purchase order, it was not in a position to supply the dues only because of the direction issued by the Ministry of Defence, Government of India. Therefore, the Court concluded that the Managing Director may not be in a position to independently decide the dispute between the parties.

Consequently, the Court proceeded to appoint an independent arbitrator.

- 20 -

20. In my opinion, the circumstances in the present case are similar and a similar course needs to be adopted. In view of the above, the petition is allowed.

21. In exercise of my powers under Section 11(4) and (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with Paragraph 2 of the Appointment of Arbitrator by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996, I hereby appoint Hon. Mr. Justice Ashok C. Agarwal, Retd.

Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, R/o No. 20, Usha Kiran, 2nd Pasta Lane, Colaba, Mumbai-400 005, as the Sole Arbitrator, to adjudicate the disputes that have arisen between the parties, on such terms and conditions as the learned Sole Arbitrator deems fit and proper. Undoubtedly, the learned Sole Arbitrator shall decide all the disputes arising between the parties without being influenced by any prima facie opinion expressed in this order, with regard to the respective claims of the parties.

22. The registry is directed to communicate this order to the Sole Arbitrator forthwith to enable him to enter upon the reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as possible.",1,

1. The operative portion of this judgment was pronounced on 13th May, 2011. The full text of the judgment is now being pronounced.

2. Civil Appeal Nos. 4510-4514 of 2011 arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 5966-5970 of 2011 are filed by five Independent Members of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly against a judgment of the Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court upholding an order passed by the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly disqualifying them under Paragraph 2(2) of Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India on the ground that they had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after their election to the Legislative Assembly as Independent candidates. The said order of disqualification was passed by the Speaker on Disqualification Application No.2 of 2010 filed by Shri D.N. Jeevaraju, Chief Whip, BJP, Karnataka Legislative Assembly and Shri C.T. Revi, Member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. Civil Appeal Nos. 4517-4521 of 2011 arising out of SLP(C) Nos.

5995-5999 of 2011 are filed by the very same five Independent Members of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly challenging the very same judgment of the  Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court upholding the order passed by the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly disqualifying them under Paragraph 2(2) of Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The said order was passed by the Speaker on Disqualification Application Nos. 3 to 7 of 2010 filed by the voters from the constituencies represented by the five MLAs. Since the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly had passed a Common Order dated 10th October, 2010 on Disqualification Application Nos. 2 to 7 of 2010, the impugned judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court also was a Common Order passed in Writ Petition Nos. 32674-32678/2010 and Writ Petition Nos. 33998-34002/2010. Therefore the basic dispute in these Civil Appeals relates to the validity of the order of disqualification passed by the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly against the Appellants on Disqualification Application Nos. 2 to 7 of 2010.

3. The Appellants herein were elected to the Thirteenth Karnataka Legislative Assembly as independent candidates in the elections held in May, 2008. On 30th May, 2008, they were sworn in as Ministers in the Cabinet of the government headed by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa, who was elected as the leader of the B.J.P. Legislature Party and was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka. On 6th October, 2010, the Appellants submitted separate letters to the Governor of Karnataka stating that having become disillusioned with the functioning of the Government headed by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa, in which there was widespread corruption and nepotism, a situation had arisen where the governance of the State could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India. The Appellants also indicated that Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa had, therefore, forfeited his right to continue as Chief Minister having lost the confidence of the people  and in the interest of the State and the people of Karnataka, they were expressing their lack of confidence in the Government headed by Shri B.S.

Yeddyurappa and as such they were withdrawing support to the Government headed by him as the Chief Minister. The Governor was also requested to intervene and institute the constitutional process as constitutional head of the State. On the same day, on the basis of the letters written by the Appellants and others, the Governor of Karnataka asked the Chief Minister to prove his majority on the Floor of the House by 12th October, 2010.

4. On the very next day i.e. on 7th October, 2010, the Respondent Nos.1 and 3, namely, Shri D.N.

Jeevaraju and Shri C.T. Ravi, the Chief Whip and the General Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party, respectively, filed Complaint No.2 of 2010 dated 6th October, 2010 with the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly under Rule 6 of the  Karnataka Legislative Assembly (Disqualification of Members on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ""Disqualification Rules"", to declare that the Appellants had incurred disqualification on the ground of defection as contained in the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution. On the basis of the said Disqualification Application, on 8th October, 2010 the Speaker issued Show-Cause Notices to the Appellants informing them of the Disqualification Application filed by the Chief Whip of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the General Secretary thereof, indicating that despite having got elected as independent candidates, they became members of the B.J.P. Legislature Party and also became Ministers and thereby they violated Paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution. The Appellants were informed that they had acted in violation of paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India and it disqualified  them from continuing as Members of the Legislature.

The Appellants were given time till 5.00 p.m. on 10th October, 2010, to submit their objections, if any, to the Disqualification Application either in writing or presenting themselves in person, failing which it would be presumed that they had no explanation to offer and further action would thereafter be taken ex-parte in accordance with law. In the meanwhile on 9th October, 2010, Disqualification Application Nos.3 to 7 were filed by some voters against the Appellants and show-

cause notices were issued by the Speaker on the same day requiring the Appellants to submit their explanation before 5.00 p.m. on 10th October, 2010.

5. Having come to know about the show-cause notices from the media, the Appellants through an Advocate submitted a letter to the Speaker on 9th October, 2010, indicating that they had come to learn from the media that the show-cause notices  had been issued to them as per the orders of the Speaker. In the said letter it was categorically stated that the procedural requirements of Rule 7 of the Disqualification Rules had not been complied with as copies of the Petition and annexures were not supplied to the Appellants and a period of 7 days to submit the reply was not given to them. A specific request was made to the Speaker to supply the said documents and to grant a period of 7 days to submit the reply. Though the documents were not supplied, the Appellants though their Advocate submitted an interim reply on 10th October, 2010, during the proceedings before the Speaker. It was specifically stated in the reply that it was submitted as an interim reply without prejudice to and by way of abundant caution and reserving the right of the Appellants to submit exhaustive reply.

6. The Appellants further submitted in the interim reply that the notice was in clear violation of the  Disqualification Rules, 1986, and especially Rules 6 and 7 thereof. It was mentioned that Rule 7(3) requires copies of the petition and annexures thereto to be forwarded along with the show-cause notice. The notice which was pasted on the doors of the MLA quarters in the MLA hostels at Bangalore, which were locked and used by the legislators only when the House was in session, called upon the Appellants to reply to the notice by 5.00 p.m. on 10th October, 2010, which was in complete violation of Rule 7 of the above-mentioned Rules which laid down a mandatory procedure for dealing with the petition seeking disqualification under the Rules. In fact, even the time to reply to the notices was reduced to the severe prejudice to the Appellants. It was pointed out that Rule 7 requires that the Appellants should have been given 7 days' time to reply or within such further period as the Speaker may for sufficient cause allow. It was contended that under the said Rule the Speaker  could only extend the time by a further period of 7 days, but could not curtail the same from 7 days to 3 days. It was the categorical case of the Appellants that the minimum notice period of 7 days was a mandatory requirement of the basic principles of natural justice in order to enable a MLA to effectively reply to the Show-Cause Notice issued to him seeking his disqualification from the Legislative Assembly. It was mentioned in the reply to the Show-Cause Notice that issuance of such Show-Cause Notice within a truncated period was an abuse and misuse of the constitutional provisions for the purpose of achieving the unconstitutional object of disqualifying sufficient number of Members of the Assembly from the membership of the House in order to prevent them from participating in the Vote of Trust scheduled to be taken by Shri B.S. Yeddiyurappa on the Floor of the House at 11 a.m. on 11th October, 2010. It was contended that the Show-Cause Notice was ex-

facie unconstitutional and illegal, besides being motivated and malafide and devoid of jurisdiction.

7. In addition to the above, it was also sought to be explained that it was not the intention of the Appellants to withdraw support to the government formed by the B.J.P., but only to the Government headed by Shri Yeddiyurappa. It was contended that withdrawal of support from the Government headed by Shri B.S. Yeddiyurappa as the Chief Minister of Karnataka, did not fall within the scope and purview of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India. In the reply, the Appellants categorically denied the allegation that they had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. It was asserted that they remained independents and they had not joined any political party including Bharatiya Janata Party. It was claimed that they were always treated as independents only. It was urged that the conduct of the Appellants did not fall within the  meaning of ""defection"" or within the scope of para 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule of Constitution of India or the Scheme and object thereof. However, on 10th October, 2010 itself, the Speaker passed an order ""disqualifying the Appellants from the post of MLA for violation of Para 2 of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India with immediate effect.""

The said disqualification is the subject matter of this litigation.

8. At this juncture, it is necessary to take note of the fact that 13 MLAs, belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party, had also withdrawn their support to the Government led by Shri B.S.

Yeddyurappa and had made the same request to the Governor, as had been made by the Appellants herein, for initiating the constitutional process in the wake of their withdrawal of support to the Government led by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa. This had resulted in the filing of Disqualification  Application No.1 by Shri Yeddyurappa against the said MLAs and ultimately in their disqualification from the membership of the House. The Civil Appeals challenging their disqualification has been heard by this Court and judgment has been reserved.

Learned counsel for the Appellants submits that the same issues as were involved in the earlier cases are also involved in the present case, except that while in the case involving the 13 B.J.P. MLAs, the allegation made against them was that they had voluntarily left the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the present case the allegation against the Appellants is that having got elected as independent candidates they had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party by extending support to Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa and by joining his Ministry as Cabinet Ministers.

The same grievances as were raised by the 11 B.J.P.

MLAs who were disqualified have been raised by the Appellants herein. It has been reiterated on behalf of the Appellants that the very basic  requirements of natural justice and administrative fair play had been denied to them. On the other hand, not only were they not served with notice of the disqualification proceedings, but they were not even given sufficient time to deal with the allegations made against them. According to the Appellants, the proceedings before the Speaker, who had acted in hot haste in disqualifying the Appellants before the Vote of Confidence was to be taken by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa, had been vitiated as a result of such conduct on the part of the Speaker.

9. Appearing in support of the Civil Appeals arising out of SLP(C) Nos.5966-5970 of 2011, Mr. P.P. Rao, learned Senior Advocate, contended that by not allowing the Appellants sufficient time to even reply to the Show-Cause Notices issued to them, in violation of Rule 7 of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly (Disqualification of Members  on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1986, the Appellants had been deprived of a valuable opportunity to meet the allegations, although their membership of the House depended on a decision on the said allegations and their response thereto. Mr. Rao also submitted that apart from being denied a proper hearing in terms of the statutory rules, the High Court had erroneously interpreted the provisions of paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India in holding that the Appellants had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, as alleged by the complainants. Mr. Rao submitted that it had been alleged that the Appellants had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party either when prior to the formation of the Ministry they had given individual letters of support to Shri Yeddyurappa as the leader of the B.J.P. Legislature Party, or when they had joined the Cabinet as Ministers in the B.J.P. Government led by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa.

10. Mr. Rao then urged that the High Court had also misconstrued the concept of whips being issued to ensure compliance by Members of a particular political party, who were also Members of the Legislature Party of the said political party.

Mr. Rao urged that such whip had been issued to the Appellants, who as Members of the Government may have acted in terms thereof, but that did not mean that the Appellants had formally joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, as had been concluded by the Speaker.

11. Mr. Rao contended that neither the Speaker nor the High Court had addressed these issues correctly in relation to the evidence available before him, as had been observed by the Constitution Bench in Rajendra Singh Rana & Ors. Vs. Swami Prasad Maurya & Ors. [(2007) 4 SCC 270]. Mr. Rao submitted that events subsequent to the date on which an independent Member joins a political party is not  material for a decision as to whether the particular Member had, in fact, joined the political party or not. Mr. Rao also urged that neither the decision in the case of Dr. Mahachandra Prasad Singh Vs. Chairman, Bihar Legislative Council & Ors. [(2004) 8 SCC 747], nor the decision in the case of Jagjit Singh Vs. State of Haryana [(2006) 11 SCC 1], had any application to the facts of this case, since in the said cases what was sought to be explained by this Court is that the Speaker could not give a finding regarding disqualification on the basis of conduct subsequent to the date on which a M.L.A. becomes disqualified from being a Member of the House. It was also observed that when the view taken by the Tribunal is a reasonable one, the Court would be slow to strike down the view regarding disqualification on the ground that another view was better. Mr. Rao urged that in the instant case, reliance by the Speaker on the decision of this Court in the case  of G. Vishwanath Vs. Speaker [(1996) 3 SCC 353], is not of much assistance to the Respondents, because even from the conduct of the Appellants, it could not be said that they had joined the B.J.P.

Legislature Party. Mr. Rao urged that the fact that the Appellants had attended meetings of the B.J.P. Legislature Party was of little help to the Respondents since in the Attendance Register of the meetings they had been shown as independent Members and a separate group under the heading ""Independent Co-Members"".

12. Mr. Rao urged that the Appellants had always been treated as a separate group from the B.J.P.

Legislature Party and it is only in connection with this case that the Respondents had attempted to show that the Appellants had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and by withdrawing support from the B.J.P. Government led by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa,  they had incurred disqualification under paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution.

13. Mr. Rao also contended that the Whip issued by the Chief Whip of the B.J.P. Legislature Party did not form part of the documents produced before the Speaker, and, in any event, no Whip was served on the Appellants nor had they signed such a Whip.

Therefore, the allegation that they had acted in accordance with such Whip did not and could not arise and the finding of the Speaker to the contrary, was perverse. Mr. Rao added that the Whips which have been subsequently brought on record in W.P.(C)Nos.32674-32678 of 2010, reveal that when the Whips were addressed to the ruling party Members, including the Ministers, they were addressed as Members of the Party, whereas the remaining five Whips were addressed to the Appellants as Hon'ble Ministers.

14. Mr. Rao also submitted that in the Whips issued to the Appellants nowhere had it been indicated that they had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Mr. Rao urged that the positive case made out by the Respondents in the application for disqualification was that the Appellants had joined the B.J.P. before they were sworn in as Ministers of Cabinet rank on 30th May, 2008, and not that they joined the B.J.P. later before the issuance of Whips on 29th December, 2009. Mr. Rao repeated his earlier contention that the question before the Speaker for consideration was whether the Appellants had joined the B.J.P. before their being sworn in on 30th May, 2008, or not. It was submitted that it was beyond the Speaker's jurisdiction to decide any matter other than what had been indicated in the Disqualification Application.

15. On the question of scope of judicial review of the Speaker's order, Mr. Rao submitted that although reliance had been placed on paragraph 109 of the decision of this Court in Kihoto Hollohan Vs. Zachillhu [(1992) Supp.2 SCC 651], wherein, it was held that judicial review of the order of the Speaker should be confined to jurisdictional errors only, the observations contained in paragraph 103 of the judgment had not been noticed. Mr. Rao submitted that in the said paragraph, it had been clarified that the finality clause in paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution does not completely exclude the jurisdiction of the Courts under Articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution, though, it does have the effect of limiting the scope of the Courts' jurisdiction under the said provision. It was further observed that the principle applied by the courts is that inspite of a finality clause it is always open to the High Court or the Supreme Court to examine  whether the action of the authority is ultra vires the powers conferred on it or whether the power so exercised was in contravention of a mandatory provision of law. Mr. Rao urged that the judgment in Kihoto Hollohan's case (supra) could not be read piecemeal, but would have to be read as a whole.

16. Mr. Rao submitted that in the instant case, the Speaker's order had been made in violation of paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule by erroneously equating the expression ""Political Party"" with the Government of the State. Mr. Rao also submitted that the order of the Speaker had been passed in disregard of the relevant statutory Rules, namely, the Karnataka Disqualification Rules and without reconsidering the materials available with the Speaker under the aforesaid Rules.

17. Mr. Rao then urged that the Speaker has also erred in entertaining the applications of voters in violation of Rule 6 of the aforesaid Rules and also  Rule 7(3) which require the Speaker to give a minimum of 7 days' time to reply to the show-cause notice issued by him. Mr. Rao submitted that the order was also liable to be quashed on the ground of violation of the principles of natural justice by not giving the Appellants a reasonable opportunity to present their case effectively.

18. Mr. Rao lastly submitted that the order of the Speaker was perverse and was tailored to suit the Government led by Shri B.S. Yeddyurappa in the Vote of Confidence that was to follow the day after the decision had been pronounced by the Speaker. Mr. Rao also repeated his earlier submissions that the Speaker had proceeded in the matter in great haste to meet the aforesaid deadline.

19. Mr. Rao submitted that the Speaker had acted in a mala fide manner in order to bail out the Chief Minister and to save his own Chair by not referring the case to the Committee of Privileges having  regard to the allegations of bias made by the Appellants in their replies to the Show-Cause Notices and deciding the case himself, while continuing to be a Member of the Bharatiya Janata Party while occupying the Chair of the Speaker.

20. On the question as to whether the Disqualification Rules were mandatory or directory, Mr. Rao submitted that the decision in Ravi S. Naik Vs. Union of India [(1994) Suppl.2 SCC 641] was per incuriam as it had not adverted to the decision of the Constitution Bench in Kihoto Hollohan's case (supra), wherein it had been held that the Speaker's decision while exercising power under paragraph 6(1) of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution did not enjoy the immunity under Articles 122 and 212 from judicial scrutiny as had also been pointed out by K.T. Thomas, J. in Mayawati Vs. Markandeya Chand [(1998) 7 SCC 517].

Mr. Rao urged that in any event, the view expressed  in Ravi S. Naik's case (supra) was no longer good law after the subsequent Constitution Bench decision in Rajendra Singh Rana's case (supra), wherein it has been laid down that the Speaker was expected to follow the Rules framed under the Tenth Schedule which had been approved by the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Rao urged that the Speaker had all throughout treated the Appellants as independent Members as would be evident from the debates of the Assembly.

21. Mr. Rao then submitted that the circumstances leading to the disqualification of the Appellants was quite obviously stage-managed in order to help the Chief Minister to survive the Confidence Vote on 11th October, 2010, by any means and the same will be evident from the affidavits filed later by the voters who had filed Disqualification Petitions, which exposed the involvement of the Speaker and his Office as well as the Political  Advisor to the Chief Minister in inducing them to sign such applications. Mr. Rao submitted that the decision of the Speaker having been taken in violation of paragraph 2(2) of the Tenth Schedule, Rules 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7(3) of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly (Disqualification of Members on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1986, and the principles of natural justice, was perverse and mala fide and was not sustainable either on facts or law.

22. Appearing for the Appellants in the Civil Appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.5995-5999 of 2011, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Advocate, reiterated the submissions made by Mr. P.P. Rao in the other set of appeals. Mr. Venugopal submitted that merely because the Appellants had joined the Council of Ministers in the Yeddyurappa Government, it could not be contended that they had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Venugopal submitted  that in the past there had been several instances where Members elected as independents to the Lok Sabha had served in the Governments formed by Political Parties but had retained their status as independent Members of the House. Mr. Venugopal referred to the two instances when Mrs. Maneka Gandhi was elected to the Lok Sabha as an independent Member from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh and had served as Minister at the Centre in the Governments led by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Similarly, Shri Biswanath Das, Shri S.F. Khonglam and Shri Madhu Koda, who were all independent legislators, became Chief Ministers of the States of Orissa, Meghalaya and Jharkhand.

23. Mr. Venugopal submitted that if by joining the Yeddyurappa Ministry, the Appellants had shed their independent status and had become Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, then they stood disqualified from the membership of the House at  that stage itself. Such a stand had not, however, been taken by the complainants or even the opposition parties, till the Governor directed a Vote of Confidence to be held on 12.10.2010. Mr. Venugopal submitted that the said position would make it very clear that the Appellants continued to enjoy an independent status, although, they had extended their support to the B.J.P. Government led by Shri Yeddyurappa and had also joined the Ministry as Cabinet Ministers.",1,
